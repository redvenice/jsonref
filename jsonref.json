Christos Tsiolkas, the Australian novelist who a decade ago touched a nerve by vivisecting liberal fraudulence with The Slap, plunges now into the gore and moral stench of the early Christian period. Imagining the all-too-human reality behind the biblical narrative that shaped western civilisation, he evokes a world that is rank with anti-imperialist resentment, constant brutality, violence against women and, most obsessively, sexual shame.Like Emmanuel Carrère’s recent nonfiction work The Kingdom, Damascus is primarily an attempt to understand the character of Saint Paul, the pious Jew and persecutor of Christians who, after an alleged encounter with the risen Christ on the road to Damascus, made it his life’s mission to spread Jesus’s teachings throughout the Roman empire.It is easy to see why a novelist might become fascinated by Paul (or Saul, his Jewish name used in Damascus), a cauldron of contradictions whose fanatical will to power served a doctrine of compassion and kindness. To Friedrich Nietzsche, Paul was nothing less than a “genius of hatred”. In Tsiolkas’s imagining, he is a self-hating and repressed homosexual. “I will expire with my last breath,” he reflects after condemning a woman for adultery, then scurries to the brothels for carnal relief. “I have no heirs and I will not live. I don’t deserve to.”Like Carrère, Tsiolkas is interested in PaulSaul as a creative writer who edits and reshapes truth for literary effect. In the stoning scene that opens the novel, the doomed woman peers into Saul’s eyes and says, “If you are without sin, then cast your stone.” Tortured by lust and his own hypocrisy, Saul is thereafter haunted by the phrase which, of course, will reappear as the words of Jesus in the New Testament.Tsiolkas is no stylist – in 400 pages there’s hardly a sentence worth lingering over. His method of driving home his themes and emotional concerns is to lay it all on thick, again and again, sometimes resorting to a blunt quantification of torment: “Saul’s cheeks burn with disgust and shame. And from hate the hate outweighs the shame and makes him forget his disgust.” Fortunately, his characters speak not in the stilted Charlton Hestonisms perilous to biblical fictioneers, but in blasts of steaming vulgarity that breathe pungent life into the ancient setting. The workmanlike prose lights up when fire and blood charge through it. Damascus affords Tsiolkas ample room to indulge his penchant for the visceral, with its tone and atmosphere of a gruelling Islamic State documentary and numerous scenes of cruelty and torture. Saul hands over a boy to a pagan woman who, in retribution for the child’s insult to her goddess, has him castrated and raped, then cuts out his tongue. The child’s ordeal is a severe test of Saul’s faith.One of the novel’s provocative speculations is that Jesus himself was raped by his persecutors. Pagans mock Jesus as a “raped and crucified god”. The insinuation, repeated across the novel, does seem plausible. As a method of execution, crucifixion was intended not only to cause physical agony, but to utterly humiliate the victim. Perhaps the Romans added violation to the indignities they piled on to a man they regarded as a dangerous and deluded rebel.The chronology leaps back and forth across decades, alternating between scenes in the life of Saul and first-person accounts from other figures (some historical, some invented) at the dawn of Christianity. A bagginess of narrative structure threatens, until in its latter half the novel synthesises as a story of the two erging paths the Christian religion could have taken. Another of Tsiolkas’s acts of fictive licence is to suppose that Jesus had a twin: “doubting” Thomas, author of the apocryphal gospel discovered at Nag Hammadi in Egypt in 1945. While Saul declares it dogma that Christ was resurrected and would soon return to redeem “this fallen and brutal world”, for Thomas, Jesus’s true teaching was that the kingdom is already here: it exists between believers in Jesus’s message of love and forbearance.Damascus is a Greek Orthodox apostate’s admirably serious-minded effort to fathom the origins of a morality that, Tsiolkas admits in an afterword, still offers him solace and guidance, while hinting at what Jesus’s teachings might have become. “He is returning”, echoes the increasingly plaintive greeting between Saul and the early Christians. When it dawns on Saul that a second coming may not be imminent, his melancholy longing still burns fierce enough to engender a globe-ning faith: “This world is not enough.”• Rob Doyle’s Threshold is published by Bloomsbury.

Its wonderful seawater lido has been refurbished. Maintenance and repair for the sleeper trains to Paddington have been relocated due to work on HS2, creating 70 well-paid jobs. There are ambitious plans to revamp the main shopping street, which curves elegantly from the railway station to the statue of the town’s favourite son, Humphry Davy, at the top of the hill.But progress is slow. Penzance is the first and last town in Cornwall, a county that has the wage levels normally found in the most challenged parts of the north with the sort of house prices – inflated by the large number of holiday and retirement homes – associated with the plusher parts of the south-east. It was one of the first towns to suffer the hollowing out of retailing and it is not uncommon for residents to have five or six low-paid jobs in the peak summer season.Economic hardship is not immediately obvious. As James Green, director of the Newlyn art gallery, puts it: “Poverty looks different in Cornwall than it does in an urban situation. People who come here eat in the nice restaurants, they rent the pretty cottages, they walk on the beautiful beaches and they misunderstand the challenges Cornwall faces.”Tourism is thriving, according to Paul Ainsworth, chef patron of two restaurants in upmarket Padstow. “The biggest change I have seen since arriving here in 2005 is the staycation, people coming down here out of season. In the last year there’s been a huge surge in the number of people coming down here on an English holiday. In part that’s due to the pound’s weakness, but a lot of people are nervous, worried about terrorism and concerned about climate change.”Yet for all the cream teas and the golden beaches beloved by the visitors, Cornwall has much in common with old industrial Britain: the loss of jobs in staple industries the growth of low-paid precarious employment relatively high levels of disguised joblessness caused by people leaving the workforce altogether a struggle to prevent the young and the talented from leaving.It takes four and a quarter hours to get from Truro to London. It is quicker to get from London to Glasgow. I am more than 100 miles from the nearest motorway.The Conservatives won all six Cornish seats in the 2019 general election and the government has pledged to make its new shared prosperity fund as generous as the EU money it is replacing. Yet the council is worried that the investment will be skewed towards the former Labour seats in the Midlands and the north of England that gave Boris Johnson his 80-seat majority.Julian German, the independent councillor who leads Cornwall’s unitary authority, said: “We don’t want to be forgotten about. We face some of the systemic challenges the north faces and in terms of connectivity more so.”The council senses there may be an inherent bias against Cornwall, because it has no big city but rather a collection of similar-sized towns strung out along the railway line that runs down the county’s spine.Redruth is one stop of the line and on the northern edge of the town sits Krowji – Cornwall’s largest creative hub. The idea is to marry the county’s high-speed broadband – one area where it is well connected – with the students coming off the campuses at nearby Falmouth to kickstart the local economy. A new building is under construction to meet demand for space.Glenn Caplin, chief executive of Cornwall and Isles of Scilly local enterprise partnership, says that one of the failures of the past 20 years is that there are still really challenged areas reflecting structural industrial decline: in fishing in Penzance in hard rock mining around Camborne and Redruth, and in china clay mining in St Austell.He wants Cornwall’s economic future to be based on high-value sectors: digital, space, geo-resources, renewable energy, agri-technology and green tourism.This would be some transformation and for it to happen will require patience as well as cash. Penzance wants to use the money it receives from the government to create a year-round town, develop a creative sector, and encourage independent retailers back to take the place of the chains that have upped and left.The new Premier Inn and the revamped promenade along the seafront to Newlyn are signs that change can happen.

The company said that this means there is a risk it could breach certain bank covenants when they are next tested in July.The company has been involved in discussions with shareholders and potential new investors over the last few months to try to raise the target to shore up its balance sheet.“Following these discussions, Intu has concluded it is unable to proceed with an equity raise at this point,” the company said on Wednesday.“While a number of Intu’s shareholders and potential new investors indicated their support for an equity raise, the board believes the current uncertainty in the equity markets and retail property investment markets precluded a number of potential investors from committing capital into the business and Intu was therefore unable to reach the target quantum at the current time.”“While it is disappointing that the extreme market conditions have prevented us from moving forward with our planned equity raise, I am pleased that a number of alternative options have presented themselves during the process, which we will now explore further,” said Matthew Roberts, the chief executive of Intu. “We remain focused on fixing our balance sheet in the near term to ensure this business has the financial footing it needs to realise its significant potential.”The company said it is currently in compliance with its debt covenants but that “there is a risk that, depending on the performance of Intu’s business and movements in valuations, it could be in breach of certain covenants at there scheduled testing date in July 2020”.The company said it is seeking to take “timely mitigating actions”, including seeking covenant waivers, to deal with any potential breaches in July.“We will face further challenges in what has been an extraordinary few months for Intu and the wider sector,” Roberts said. “This is a compelling proposition and one that will stand the test of time. Operationally, our business is strong, delivering a resilient rental performance despite ongoing pressure from CVAs and administrations, with stable occupancy rates and footfall that consistently outperforms the benchmark.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed264f073eb78e4c0f802036eb9bb9e7e02daec2/0_323_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6c78daa6ff499e845d8b1c510adaabc","title":"joe biden resurrection super tuesday 2020","story":"Super Tuesday’s super wins for Biden change nothing about his flaws, but they do underscore the strength of his sales pitch to a Trump-weary worldThe resurrection of Joe Biden is almost complete. In less than a week, the former vice-president has walked out of the tomb of loser candidates into the glorious sunshine of frontrunner greatness.This is a remarkable turnaround by any measure. It also reflects no change in Biden’s qualities or character, and everything about a party with a singular focus on one factor: kicking Trump out of office.Super Tuesday’s super wins for Biden change nothing about his flaws as a candidate but they do underscore the strength of his sales pitch to a Trump-weary world.Biden’s wins also change nothing about Bernie Sanders’ strength as an insurgent critic of the establishment they may even boost them.But they most definitely blow a hole in his sales pitch to Democrats: that he can build a vast turnout machine to energize the base of the party to beat Donald Trump.Whatever Nevada bestowed on Bernie, the south hath taken away. In Las Vegas, Sanders seemed to build a erse coalition of supporters. But across the south, the bedrock of the party – African American voters in Virginia, the Carolinas and Alabama – made their choice of Biden so clear and loud, the cable networks didn’t wait to count the votes.Until now, the debate among nervous Democrats has been about whether the party’s superdelegates could take a contested convention away from Sanders. Could the party survive that schism, and would Bernie’s fans reconcile themselves to another nominee?But after Tuesday, there’s a vastly bigger question to consider. Could the party really nominate a candidate who isn’t competitive among the black voters who delivered such huge victories in the congressional contests in 2018, and the presidential contests of 2012 and 2008?There is precedent for what we’re witnessing. The last nominee to come back from the dead like this is actually Joe Biden’s friend and former fellow senator in all things foreign relations: John Kerry.Back in 2004, Democrats were on fire for another progressive Vermont firebrand. Howard Dean was building huge numbers of online donors and seemed to be the only candidate with an energized base to take on a deeply-polarizing president. But when big news broke through – at the time, the capture of Saddam Hussein – the contest flipped on its head. Kerry won in Iowa and never looked back. Within two months, Kerry had sewn the whole thing up.As the bumper stickers said at the time, Democrats dated Dean but they married Kerry. And the reason for the shift was their desperate desire to beat an incumbent president they loathed. The party wanted to leave as little room for error as possible, even though they knew that Kerry was a flawed frontrunner.Although we like to think that everything is different about Donald Trump, some things look pretty similar. Bush was hated around the world, seemed to be destroying core American values, and counted on the die-hard support of the conservative media echo chamber. Trump is all that on Viagra.It looks like Joe Biden is playing a similar role to John Kerry, and there are good reasons why. After all the turmoil of Trump, voters are understandably anxious to return to normal life. The global threat of a botched response to coronavirus underscores the catastrophic effects of an utterly incompetent, but perfectly sociopathic president.This is not a subtle choice, which is just as well, because the Trump campaign has all the subtlety of a jackboot.That’s why the collapse of Biden’s competition at the center of the party is not surprising. From Pete Buttigieg to Amy Klobuchar, the signs are clear: Democrats will not look favorably on anyone who interferes with their best chance to beat Trump.What is surprising is the speed of Biden’s turnaround. Just two weeks ago, reliable polling in Virginia suggested the race was tied. The speed and direction of this contest is not good for the Sanders campaign.Which takes us to the dismal news of the night. If you think Sanders fans were disappointed, you should talk to staffers and consultants propping up Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren. It feels odd to lump them together: one is plainly trying to buy his way to the nomination, the other has tried to wonk her way to it.However, Bloomberg’s poor showing on Super Tuesday simply reinforced how this contest is no different from all the others that came before it. You can dump a lot of money into the toilet bowl that is TV advertising, but you still can’t ignore the early states and jump straight into Super Tuesday.Warren’s bad night was arguably worse and far less fair on the merits. Bloomberg just wanted to be relevant Warren wanted to be right. She trounced the field on policy details and on the debate stage. But she wouldn’t or couldn’t turn her fire on Bernie, to consolidate the left behind a candidate with crossover appeal. So she ended up losing her home state of Massachusetts after running one of the very best campaigns of the cycle – and winning precisely nothing.Sanders himself declared victory with just two states under his belt, one of which is his home state of Vermont. “When we began this race for the presidency, everyone said it couldn’t be done,” he said in Essex Junction, Vermont. “We are going to win,” he continued as his fans chanted BER-NEE, BER-NEE, “we are going to defeat Trump because we are putting together an unprecedented grassroots multigenerational multiracial movement”.That movement somehow doesn’t include African Americans in the south.“You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,” Sanders said, before attacking Biden for his vote on the war in Iraq. That was a debate from 18 years ago, which is approximately the age of Sanders’ most enthusiastic voters.By the time Sanders stopped talking, Biden had won another state – Arkansas – to add to another five he had already locked up early on Tuesday.Never mind that Biden started his victory speech by mistaking his sister for his wife. Or the way two protesters rushed on stage as he began to fire up the crowd.“For those who’ve been knocked down, counted out and left behind, this is your campaign,” he said. “I’m here to report this campaign is very much alive.”Biden’s revival after weeks of bad news is his model for the country’s revival after years of Trump news. “We are better than this moment,” Biden shouted. “We are better than this president!”He was speaking from a teleprompter, and yet he still screwed up plenty of lines. But Biden still landed some zingers, just as he scrapped out several big wins. As he walked off stage, he was declared the winner in Minnesota.Sanders’ victory in California will be a source of hope for his campaign. But scraping out a slender delegate lead is not the same as a multigenerational, multiracial movement to beat Trump. For now the momentum is with Biden: it’s his race to lose once again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c7d7289f139039f3edde23ec5adeda56c1ff7a9/3_0_1653_992/master/1653.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026amp;s=f7c413774c0f8b6f44f47cf7b22b02ba","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of paradise","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘paradise’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘paradise’.Share your photos of what paradise means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 4 March at 10am.

I don’t like framing,” said Chanel’s artistic director, Virginie Viard, before the brand’s autumnwinter 2020 fashion show in Paris.. Its quite a statement of intent given the megabrand’s decades-long ownership of the concept of fashion show as theatrical blockbuster.So on Tuesday, there was no rocket taking off in the middle of the catwalk (2017) no supermarket complete with boxes of Chanel-branded ketchup bottles (2014). Instead, models walked against a glossy white set, with layers of curvy seating trimmed with black, recalling a map’s contour lines.Viard, Karl Lagerfeld’s long-term right-hand woman, has taken a softer, subtler approach since taking over after the legendary designer’s death just over a year ago. This collection continued in that vein, throwing the focus on to more than 70 mainly monochrome looks, with occasional hints of coral pink. Current trends were addressed puffy sleeves, Wolf Hall necklines and thigh high splits in midi skirts were all present.Models came two or three abreast at times. Gigi Hadid walked, arm in arm, between two other models, a move which felt protective given her altercation last season with a catwalk gatecrasher.Trousers came with poppers at the side, fanning open to display footwear described, in press notes, as “seven-league boots” – which according to Charles Perrault’s fairytales allow wearers to traverse seven leagues per step – inspired by a pair once worn by Lagerfeld.There was a New Romantic mood in those piratey, Adam Ant-ish boots and the many ruffle-fronted shirts Madonna and Boy George were evoked in the liberal use of crucifixes. Two large crucifixes were knitted into jumpers, recalling the Lacroix crucifix jacket famously chosen by Anna Wintour – controversially, at the time, paired with jeans – for her first Vogue cover in 1988. That 1980s-influenced crucifix was the main trend takeaway, and looked ripe for reinvention.Kanye West staged a more bombastic, Lagerfeld-esque spectacle the previous evening. In a contrarian move, as some other brands scaled back fashion week plans owing to coronavirus fears, the musician’s Yeezy label made a surprise last-minute entry on to the schedule.No designer since Giorgio Armani has loved beige as much as West, who brought sand and ochre to the catwalk, in a pumped-up version of the dusty, post-apocalyptic athleisure that has become his signature. Stand out pieces included funnel-necked irregularly undulating puffer jackets, although West’s six-year-old daughter, North West, stole the show when she took to the catwalk and rapped, and duly melted the internet.Stealing Paris fashion week must have been satisfying for West, whose last Paris show was his 2011 debut. Critics were underwhelmed then, and less forgiving than they might have been, given his prior declaration that the show would “change the course of fashion”. Since then, however, that prophecy has come true, particularly in the trainer market. West’s much-copied Yeezy line racked up sales of more than $1.5bn (£1.2bn) in 2019, the bulk of which from the ubiquitous, squishy wedge-shaped Yeezy Boost 350s.Earlier on Tuesday, Gucci cancelled its cruise show, which had been scheduled to take place in San Francisco on 18 May. The move was made in response to “the ongoing uncertainty prompted by the coronavirus outbreak, as a precautionary measure”, according to a company statement.Tokyo fashion week, which was set to take place from 16-21 March, has also been cancelled. Prada has also postponed its 21 May cruise show, which was set to take place in Tokyo, although Armani, Chanel, Dior and Max Mara’s cruise shows are still taking place in April and May. Aside from a few cancelled events on the periphery, Paris fashion week has largely gone ahead, and will close with the Louis Vuitton show late on Tuesday.The economic impact of the coronavirus is likely to be heavily felt in fashion. It has been forecast that the luxury market could lose €30-40bn in sales this year, as the industry suffers from store closures and disrupted supply chains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2dd35444bcce45766ea499f0ed9b4945999fe17/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f7ad35f6901b76a756e54511644ae98","title":"what can i use in italian food if i cant eat tomatoes","story":"Many chefs agree that tomatoes aren’t everything – and there are plenty of other ways to achieve that tangy-savoury hit, anyway• Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theI’ve stopped eating tomatoes for health reasons, but I like cooking Italian food. Are there any alternatives to tomatoes in dishes such as lasagne and caponata?Charles, North YorkshireTomatoes were a relatively late addition to Italian cuisine, with pasta sauces and braises coloured red in only the late 16th and 17th century. As the ’s food writer in Rome Rachel Roddy – whose use of the fruit has decreased since moving to Italy – puts it, we need to move away from tomato domination. “So many Italian dishes, such as hunter’s chicken, braised rabbit or oxtail stew, have a pre-tomato version,” she says, “and eight times out of 10, I prefer them.”Seek out the original versions, then focus on your use of olive oil, garlic, chilli and, if you’re making pasta sauce, the starchy pasta cooking water. Roddy has a few tricks, though, for achieving that umami flavour when tomatoes aren’t in play: “Anchovies, parmesan, porcini and herbs, such as rosemary and sage, can give that meatiness you might otherwise miss.”Lasagne is also within your grasp, Charles. Trivelli’s favourite (tomato or otherwise) is an artichoke version: remove the tough outer leaves, pare away the green flesh from the base of the artichoke and stem, scrape out the hairy choke, then slice, cook and use to layer up between sheets of lasagne, bechamel and cheese.Slow-cooked red peppers, if you can eat them, give a good base for sauces, stews and spooning over mozzarella or burrata, says Tim Siadatan, chef and co-owner of Padella, a second site of which has just opened in Shoreditch. “Put them on a charcoal grill or barbecue to get a lovely, smoky flavour,” he says, but a gas stove will also work. Cook the peppers until the outsides are nice and blistered, then transfer to a bowl and cover to steam. Once they are cool enough to handle, Siadatan peels off the skin, removes the seeds and finely slices. Then, in a separate pan, he adds “a load of sliced garlic and some dried chilli, and sweats down in olive oil over a low heat until they’re sweet and sticky.” Season with salt and pepper, add a splash of cabernet sauvignon vinegar, some fresh marjoram (if you can’t find any, use basil) and a dollop of mascarpone or creme fraiche, and you’ll have a creamy sauce to wrap around penne.Alternatively, Siadatan says, “add cooked runner beans cut into inch-long pieces with some mascarpone and basil, and you’ve got a garnish for lamb or throw in some chickpeas, lentils or other pulses for a stewy vibe.” Life without tomatoes can still be rosy.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

On a chilly, slightly wild night at Stamford Bridge Chelsea progressed to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup at the expense of the team previously known as Jürgen Klopp’s Irresistible Red Machine.Sport loves a premature note of crisis. Perhaps one or two will now be offered, although Klopp has probably earned a little breathing space before the cleaver is unsheathed. Liverpool played well in patches and might have wrenched the game their way with better finishing. But there was something else too, a sense of a pattern emerging. Even, whisper it, of some more systemic vulnerability being winkled out.How do you kill that which cannot be killed? How do you derail a runaway train? The answer, English football seems to have concluded – belatedly, Napoli might say – is you close down the full-backs. Take the flanks. Win wide. Hope they don’t score first. Stick to the plan. Here endeth the lessons of Watford.Chelsea came to Stamford Bridge with something similar in mind. They packed the central midfield, pressed hard on the flanks and took their chances. At the end of which Liverpool have three defeats from four and an FA Cup exit at the hands of a Chelsea team led in midfield by a fine display from Billy Gilmour. Gilmour is 18-years-old and 5ft 5in. He glided about the pitch like some wonderfully gifted Yugoslavia playmaker of the late 1980s, albeit in this case from Scotland via Cobham.How much will this defeat hurt Liverpool? This is not a club that defines itself in FA Cup wins, as two in the last 28 years might suggest. More interesting is the sense of opponents finally locating some traction.Klopp did pick a callow Cup team. Neco Williams started. Curtis Jones, a year older at 19, was in central midfield. Right-back was the key change, though, in a team who locate their attacking pulse on the flanks.It isn’t hard to see who Williams bases his game on. The surge, the stroll. The ball pinged in from the right with vicious fade and slice. Williams was even caught upfield early on, Trent-style, as Pedro skittered in behind, but closed the space with a spurt of gas. If you do not see the thrillingly cavalier red-shirted right-back you require please ask – others are available. That early diagonal pass looked like a plan. Frank Lampard had packed his flanks with speed and hustle, albeit slightly venerable speed and hustle in Pedro and Willian. Between them they helped make Chelsea’s opening goal.Williams passed back into central defence. Chelsea pressed high, dislodging the ball, which ran to Willian. His shot was straight at Adrián, who showed all the quick-footed agility of a municipal wheelie bin, allowing it to hit him and bounce away into the corner. Adrián made exculpatory gestures, suggesting his view had been blocked – Stamford Bridge seemed unsympathetic.Liverpool had plenty of chances to equalise. There was a triple block on the goalline at one point. They dominated the start of the second half in familiar fashion. But there was a lack of razor edge too. Sadio Mané has one goal away from Anfield since November. Divock Origi has none this season, Takumi Minamino neither. It showed at times.But it also made for a fun, carefree Cup tie. There were more than a hundred misplaced passes in the first half alone, along with 19 shots. The key stat, though, was Chelsea’s 35 long passes, many in search of that tender point behind the advancing red lines.Most likely this is just a blip. Liverpool don’t need control to win games. They can run harder than you, fight more furiously. Is this the way it’s going to be from here? A steamrollering team cranking at the throttle, trying to jump-start themselves through the endgame?Certainly the sense of interruption remains after that half-baked mid-season break, a break where it always felt like the phone was still on, inbox still pinging, pulse never quite at rest.Perhaps other teams used that time better, planned better, studied more. Another key to Watford’s success was preying on Liverpool’s high defensive line. No doubt the prospect of Olivier Giroud being fired up like a petrol lawnmower, ears pinned back, goggles clamped, ready to chug in behind Virgil van Dijk will have shot a bolt of terror through the away dressing room. These days Giroud runs like a man remembering, vaguely, how it’s done.But he did his job between the wide players and helped to make the second goal too, drawing Van Dijk upfield and allowing Chelsea to launch a full-length break. Ross Barkley ran on unchallenged then ked the ball past the unhappy Adrián.Chelsea will take great heart from victory. For Liverpool defeat will feel like a minor tremor. This team are too good not to adjust and find their rhythms again. But for the rest of the league, and for Atlético Madrid, due at Anfield in a week’s time, the next few games have their own fascination. Not to mention the sense, at last, of some space to work in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e584179c3634221ad810c80241f2a04e512ba26/0_375_5623_3374/master/5623.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=840d6d3ab165556585140fb482d1cc01","title":"i can see the mobile team saving sight in the kenyan bush in pictures","story":"Trachoma is the most common infectious cause of blindness in the world.

Failing to make women aware of that possibility would also be in breach of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidelines.As a result of the inquiry, the health minister Nadine Dorries will write to all heads and directors of midwifery and medical directors at NHS trusts this week to remind them of the Nice guidance regarding pain relief during childbirth and to ensure it is being followed.Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said the “results of the government’s inquiry are sadly not surprising”.She added: “We have spoken with many women who have been so traumatised by their experience of childbirth that they are considering ending what would otherwise be wanted pregnancies.“Pain relief is sometimes treated as a ‘nice extra’ rather than an integral part of maternity care, and women and their families can suffer profoundly as a result.“Staffing shortages may be an issue but we also know women may experience gatekeeping by healthcare professionals and be told labour ‘is meant to be hard work’,” she added.Maureen Treadwell, from the Birth Trauma Association also welcomed the findings: “We are delighted, at long last, that the Department for Health and Social Care is looking seriously at this issue. Inadequate epidural services and misinformation about risks is simply inexcusable. It is both inhumane and discriminatory.”Epidural blocks are a pain-relieving spinal injection that must be given by an anaesthetist in an obstetric unit. They are effective but not risk-free. Among other risks, they can lead to a drop in blood pressure.NHS guidelines say that women in labour can ask for epidurals at any time, including during the early stage of labour, and should be given information and support to choose what is right for them.But in January, a Sunday  investigation claimed some women were being denied epidurals because of what the paper said was a “cult of natural childbirth” in some NHS Trusts.Bogod said that “there’s reasonable, anecdotal evidence that some midwives will use the excuse that an anaesthetist isn’t available if they themselves feel an epidural isn’t appropriate for the woman based on their own beliefs around intervention-free births”.“The national standard is that a woman should be given an epidural within 30 minutes to one hour of asking for it, except in exceptional circumstances,” he said. “Labour wards are amply supplied with anaesthetists and so that isn’t an unreasonable target for us.“The commonest reason for women to be denied an epidural is because of a lack in midwife numbers: we have a drastic national shortage of midwives,” he added. The NHS in England is short of the equivalent of almost 2,500 full-time midwives.Bogod pointed to the scandals at Telford’s Princess Royal and the Royal Shrewsbury hospitals, and Morecambe Bay, where babies and mothers died preventable deaths at least partly because midwives had a focus on making women giving birth without medical intervention.“I’m not saying it’s common or regular but there are anecdotal cases,” he said. “But it’s completely unacceptable.”Gill Walton, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, (RCM) said: “Nice guidelines should be followed. Women should get pain relief when they ask. They should be making choices about their pain relief armed with the information they need to make an informed choice, so they get the pain relief that is right for them.”Walton, however, said it was a lack of anaesthetists that sometimes led to delays in epidurals being administered. “Unfortunately, due to stretched resources anaesthetists are not always available, which poses real challenges for midwives seeking the best experience for women in labour,” she said.The debate over medicalised births is long-running. RCM abandoned its normal birth campaign in 2017 amid concerns it may have put women at risk. But earlier this month University Hospitals Bristol NHS trust was criticised for advising pregnant women to avoid having epidurals. After the advice was reported in the media, the trust deleted the childbirth advice from its website and accepted it was “outdated”.Pat O’Brien, a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at University College London hospitals and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians \u0026amp Gynaecologists, said although there may still be pockets of midwives encouraging women to have non-medicalised births against their wishes, attitudes have changed “drastically” in the last few years.“Ten years ago, you would often see it,” he said. “But there has been a real culture shift in the last few years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9fbc51a450454f77ea9e427b19e256f505155f1/0_422_3824_2294/master/3824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1b75a9aff0879b6abea21d28158394d","title":"toll pay penalty epc contractum debt collection","story":"There is no point of contact and it seems a deliberate ploy to harass motoristsI drove on the M50 motorway in Ireland 12 months ago and paid the £5.52 toll online the next day.

I heard nothing for weeks and looked on the website to see if I could track my case.

Usually the culprit is Transport for London which relentlessly pursues drivers over congestion and emissions charges they can prove they have paid.The charitable explanation is that the systems of these enforcement bodies are configured to chase those who have omitted to pay and are not equipped to deal with their own worryingly frequent failures to collect card payments. Whether this is incompetence or a deliberate policy to repel challenges is unproven.EPC plc collects unpaid charges from overseas motorists across Europe. In 2018 its turnover was £9.89m and that year it was acquired by a US equity firm, Platinum Equity. Although Contractum cites EPC as its client in its letter to you, the collection firm is run by the same people and from the same Greater London address as EPC. And, like EPC, it’s made itself almost impenetrable to motorists who want to do anything other than pay up. Its automated answer message states that no questions, payments or appeals can be accepted by phone.When I asked for a contact I was told the only option was the appeals email address. This generated an automated response promising a reply within 28 days and warning that any follow-up message would start the clock ticking from scratch. No reply to my two requests for a comment ever came.There was no luck either from Contractum whose different number puts callers through to the EPC auto message. Eflow was almost as reclusive. I was told no contact details could be provided but that someone would be in touch. Silence. I called again and was told to submit a webform but the webform requires a penalty charge code.When, on the third call, I persuaded an operative to part with a customer service email, the result was instantaneous. You were contacted and informed that while your payment still could not be located, the evidence you’d repeatedly submitted over 11 months showed that you had made it and the PCN would be cancelled.It unhelpfully told me: “While eFlow is unable to comment on inidual cases, it would advise its customers who may be experiencing any payment difficulties, to contact eFlow directly.”Which, of course, you did.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

That includes the commander-in-chief.But he wants to set the record straight on a recent dust-up over a performance at a Bernie Sanders rally that got him removed from Public Enemy, the group he helped form. It’s Chuck D, co-founder and core member of the rap group, who Flav has problems with. Not Bernie Sanders.“I don’t have anything against Bernie. I think he’s a good person and I wish him luck,” Flav told the  in an interview at San Diego international airport on Super Tuesday, as he waited for his flight to Las Vegas.“I think they’re all good people,” he said. “Except Trump. Some people tried to say I did this because I’m a Trump supporter and that’s not true. Fuck Trump!”The recent episode started after Sanders’ campaign announced last week that Public Enemy was slated to perform a set at a rally for the Vermont senator. Flav’s lawyers sent a letter, which said that Flav had not endorsed any presidential candidates and that Sanders was not authorized to use the group’s image without his permission.“Hey Bernie, don’t do this,” Flav added in a handwritten note that appended the letter.In response, the group issued a statement saying it would be “moving forward without Flavor Flav” and thanked him for his years of service.In the interview, Flav said the dispute had nothing to do with Sanders, but with Chuck D for including him in plans for a performance he hadn’t agreed to.“Why try to say I’m a part of something I’m not a part of? That was all Chuck D,” said Flav.Chuck D said on Twitter that Flav’s decision to miss the performance came down to money.Tensions between the two rappers date back years Flav once sued Chuck D and the group’s management company over unpaid earnings.Despite the recent flare-up, Flav was met with fist bumps and cheers of “Flava Flaaaaav” from TSA agents patting down his pockets at security. Asked by the  about the day’s Democratic primary contest, Flav said he hadn’t spent it waiting in line to cast a ballot. He wasn’t interested.“I don’t deal with politics,” Flav said. “Chuck D, he’s the politician of the group. I’m just the friendly jester.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/319e84a87acde3593a4b2f79253155acfd943402/0_317_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17cad9624049b7db0773ba4398f6b421","title":"prog rock stars genesis to announce reunion","story":"Prog rock band featuring Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks is to perform together for the first time since 2007The British prog rock band Genesis are set to announce they will reunite.Ahead of an official announcement on Zoe Ball’s BBC Radio 2 breakfast show, the band posted a clue to their Instagram page, reading: “And then there were three”. They are expected to tour the UK.The group last played together in 2007, their first with drummer Phil Collins in 14 years, and have faced constant speculation about the possibility of a reunion in the intervening years.Genesis formed at Charterhouse school in Surrey in 1967, and enjoyed cult success until the early 1970s, when their fourth album, Foxtrot, became their highest-charting release, and a theatrical tour stoked their reputation.They reached a creative peak with the 1974 album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, which would be their last with Peter Gabriel. He left in 1975, at the end of an even more elaborate tour for the record, and embarked on a highly influential solo career.Their progressive origins would gradually smooth into a more generic pop sound. Following Gabriel’s departure, Phil Collins took over as lead singer, and Genesis achieved massive commercial success with A Trick of the Tail in 1976. Steve Hackett would leave the band a year later, leaving them as the trio of Collins, Rutherford and Banks.It is estimated that Genesis have sold between 100 and 150m albums worldwide. In 2010, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

They’re too busy analysing their data – which they’ll share with you at every opportunity. Speed, distance, altitude, vertical drop, crystals captured … friends of the tech hound may want to take their own noise-cancelling headphones on holiday.The tech hound laughs in the face of unplugging for a digital-free ski break. They have a camera in their helmet, an augmented reality version of the slopes playing in their goggles and smart boots fitted with a wearable device to deliver real-time audio ski coaching tips via an app. They’d be filming it all on their drone if the devices weren’t banned from most ski resorts.Tips for tech hounds: Check in with your resort to see what tech is on offer before you arrive. For instance, Club Med has introduced digital RFID bracelets, which provide room access and easy payment around the resort property. Perfect for the techy on the slopes.For the show-off, the mountain is a mere background wallpaper in the story of their life, the gondola is a place to do their makeup, and their skis purely a means of transport to push from one epic selfie spot to another. Of which there are so many all around.The show-off works best on bluebird days and hides in the hotel during photographically challenging blizzards or whiteouts. They used to hang out at the snow park taking selfies at the top of the half pipe until someone pushed them off the lip one day. They got stuck in the centre and had to be pulled out by mountain rescue on a skidoo. Still, it made a good Instagram story.Tips for show-offs: Keep your phone in an inside jacket pocket as close to your body as possible, as cold temperatures will make your battery run out more quickly.Resort pick: Club Med Val Thorens is the perfect base to tick off the 3 Vallées selfie spot trail.“How hard can it be?” thought the first-timer. They’d seen Ski Sunday and watched a couple of YouTube tutorials on the flight over. The first-timer was used to success, unaccustomed to failure, which might explain why they asked for expert skis at the hire shop. And then proceeded to almost twist a knee when their binding didn’t release during a pile-up, which they themselves had caused by skiing into a group getting off the chairlift.At least it saved them from taking on the icy black run they were about to attempt, though. The lifties bundled the first-timer back down the way they came, to the safety of the green runs and covered magic carpet. And there they skied, with their bum in the air as is the form for all beginners who don’t have lessons, being overtaken by kids half their size, until the end of their holiday.Tips for first-timers: Get lessons. There’s no shame in ski school. It’s the quickest way to progress, and even advanced skiers will improve with some tailored tuition. And thanks to Club Med’s partnership with Ecole du Ski Français (ESF), customers get free lessons (available Monday to Friday).Après-ski royalty does not care about first lifts. They’re not even sure they exist, though they did hear someone mention the concept once. Just before midday is when après-ski royalty likes to head up the mountain to avoid the afternoon lift pass rush. Queues are not their scene at all.They might do a red run, a quick head-clearer, with a pace and poise that belies the little amount of time they actually spend on snow rather than in the bar. And then it’s time to settle down for lunch at a sunny outdoor deck with a cocktail or two, moving to each new après spot like clockwork with the sun as it shifts around the mountain.At three, it’s time for the VIP bar at La Folie Douce, where they’ll dance on a table draped in a sea of feather boas. Obvs. As the sun starts to set, après-ski royalty styles it down the mountain and heads home.Tips for après-ski royalty: Research happy hour slots and the best après spots in advance so you can plan your route with precision.Resort pick: Club Med Alpe d’Huez is a top resort for après-ski vibes, with one of the finest Folie Douce in the Alps.The new parents stand at the top of the chairlift scratching their heads. They’re sure they’ve forgotten something. Gloves, poles, phone, oh yes, they remember, we have a child now! But it’s OK, she’s in nursery today. Blinking into the morning sun, the dad remembers he left his goggles on the changing mat, while the mum wonders if the white on her jacket is milk, baby sick or snow.Then they push off – it feels weird at first, but they embrace their newfound freedom, skiing together in the endless white. It’s just like the old days, except this morning they have the slopes to themselves as only new parents and powder hounds are up this early.They’re exhausted by lunchtime and downing double espressos to get through the afternoon, but they return to their child with a sparkle in their eyes. They only planned to use the odd day of nursery, but they sign their beloved up for the rest of the week.Tips for new parents: All-inclusive snow trips are a great option for families with young children, thanks to their on-site nurseries, child-friendly meal provision, and day-long kids’ clubs.Resort pick: Club Med Les Arcs Panorama, where the Club Med has one of the best childcare setups in the Alps.Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b79e90e9569133d7cce95f37dec74b85f069d02/0_354_5314_3189/master/5314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92424137c2aa5cc8cc1016ca7a6ab07d","title":"win an all inclusive ski holiday for two","story":"Enjoy a luxurious week in the snow with an all-inclusive week-long stay in the new Club Med Alpe d’Huez resort – enter now for your chance to winSki season is here and the mountains are calling.

Narrow down your search with these tipsThere are more than 5,000 ski resorts in the world, in more than 50 different countries. So how on earth do you begin to find the right one for you? The choice of destination can be overwhelming, let alone picking an inidual resort. And don’t expect Google to have the answer. Unless the question is: “Which ski resorts are best at search engine optimisation?”Here’s everything you need to know about skiing in France, Switzerland and Japan.Family-friendly fun in FranceTypical ski season: December-MayThe appeal is helped by France’s proximity to the UK, which means short flight times and plenty of low-cost airline choice, along with the opportunity to drive or take the environmentally-friendly train option.And French resorts are especially good for family snow trips, thanks to their English-speaking ski schools, tailored beginner areas and fun snow parks for kids. Many resorts also have an impressive array of non-ski activities to keep things enjoyable for children.Nestled in an enchanted pine forest at 1,750 metres, Club Med Les Arcs Panorama is a great choice for families, as it’s right on the slopes and has children’s classes and clubs available from four months up. Kids will love the playful animal sculptures dotted around the property, the ski trails through the woods and the resort’s famed toboggan runs.A luxury treat in SwitzerlandTypical ski season: November-MaySkiing in Switzerland is for those who want to push the boat out – a place of chocolate box beauty, where time appears to have stood still. But its popularity with Britons is also because it boasts some of the best ski resorts in Europe, with great pistes for all levels, excellent snow records, and renowned ski schools.Saint-Moritz was the world’s first winter sports resort and continues to have a reputation for glitz and glamour. By staying at the Club Med Saint-Moritz Roi Soleil you can enjoy all the chicness from a safe distance, knowing the price of your all-inclusive holiday was fixed in advance. The resort is linked to the extensive Engadin valley, and off-piste activities include Nordic skiing, riding in horse-drawn carriages and cosy fondue suppers.Crowd-free adventures in JapanTypical ski season: December-MarchHeading to Japan is the ultimate choice for adventurous skiers and snowboarders who want a fresh and original take on their winter break. Yes, you have to travel farther, but once you’re there Japan will more than deliver on the experience, as more and more British travellers are discovering each year.Hokkaido in the north of the country is the premier spot for skiing and snowboarding. Expect uncrowded slopes, plentiful fresh powder snow, phenomenal food, and unique insights into Japanese culture. Club Med’s Tomamu Hokkaido gives you ski-in ski-out access to Tomamu Mountain, a mix of cultural exploration and a great snow experience. Enjoy the 145 hectares of powder to play in, thaw out in a Japanese onsen and learn how to make sushi from the resort chef.Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/707fa2b94e73ba6e566db2307244a83d8f3fd75a/0_115_5126_3076/master/5126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de1f22a49e2fac3cb06c6bfd34ae63f6","title":"lost decade hidden story how austerity broke britain","story":"What happened in the UK between 2010 and 2020 will scar us for the rest of our lives. David Cameron’s Conservatives, only just victorious in the 2010 election, sold austerity as a necessary response to the 2008 financial crash. The exact social consequences of these cuts were spelled out last week in Michael Marmot’s report for the Institute of Health Equity: for the first time in a century, life expectancy has stopped growing and for women in poor areas actually fallen.We should never stop reminding ourselves just what an astonishing decade we have lived through. In the aftermath of the crash, employment climbed and stayed remarkably high. But these new jobs paid badly and it took until two months ago for earnings to reach where they were before 2008. It is no surprise that debt is mountainous: each household owes on average £15,385, not counting their mortgages. The gap between rich and poor has widened the young are now worse off than their parents at their age home ownership has declined steeply – families are stuck in life-long and precarious private renting.In our 2010 book The Verdict, we evaluated the Blair-Brown era, years of marked social progress. For a new investigation, to assess the extent of the past decade’s damage, we went back to the people we talked to then to see how they have fared since and the hidden ways that austerity has affected their lives.We followed the fortunes of Emma Percy, in Folkestone, Kent. With her husband, Rob, and three children, the family moved from one rented home to another, changing the children’s schools as rents rose, roofs leaked. They were sometimes living without a functioning boiler all winter long. They were the “just about managing”. Theresa May never got round to helping. Emma and Rob did all the striving and aspiring the prime minister had called for, hoping to save for a deposit, but never quite making enough. In the summer, the only holiday they could afford was camping in the grounds of the school where Rob was caretaker. Their parents own homes they may never.Decades take shape in the rearview mirror. Even as the past decade was unfolding, people were aware times were out of joint, an unprecedented number telling a Hansard Society survey at the end of 2018 that the UK was in decline. Everyone saw that pressing national tasks were neglected, as carbon cuts and affordable housing targets were missed, as transport worsened along with education and productivity. Instead, massive efforts were erted into ideological futility. On the whims of ministers, probation was broken apart, forensic services wrecked and enormous effort wasted on pushing England’s schools out of public control into semi-private academies and trusts, in evidence-free reorganisations. People expect someone to monitor air and water quality, inspect restaurants and food standards. But the environmental health officers we visited in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, were inspecting fewer kebab shops and closing air-monitoring stations despite more pollution. We were there on an inspection when they found a stack of meat pies on the dirty floor of a roadside cafe: the officer told us they register fewer food outlets as high risk, for lack of staff to check them. Nationally, one in 10 takeaways now score zero or one for hygiene and safety. Andy Birks, a butcher in Rotherham in South Yorkshire, told us he hadn’t seen a health inspector in years. “I don’t think there are any left,” he said. Like so many high-street shops, his business had declined in the decade since we first met him, his profits down since 2010.A Friday night in the control room with Bedfordshire police told the same story of services stretched to breaking point. Mental health and domestic violence dominated the calls. A neighbour reported a man next door banging on his wife’s window, threatening violence. A man called as he chased his son across a dark park, terrified he might harm himself. The chief constable, Jon Boutcher, had just written to his MP recounting a typical night of rapes, stabbings and a lethal traffic accident involving young children. “I run out of officers regularly for 999 calls,” he said.In Hastings, East Sussex, we watched the closure of another day centre, the building sold by the cash-strapped council. This was the seventh of these havens for older adults to close in the town since 2010. As packing cases were being filled with pictures from the walls, we talked to Rose, Mary and Sal, old friends sitting together as they always did, but now for the last time. Home alone, the statistics showed that many more would arrive in A\u0026ampE malnourished or dehydrated. That is the constant perversity of austerity scrimping a bit now to cost more later.Everywhere, we found a sense of common belonging diminished, with fewer meeting places, playing fields sold off, museums and libraries closed. As the public realm shrank, so did social capital, found the ONS, with less trust and neighbours not talking to one another. Pub closures – premises were down from 52,500 in 2001 to 38,000 by 2020 – were another loss of sociability.Cameron’s “big society” gimmick delivered a smaller one, as people donated less to charities and volunteering declined. Foreign journalists filmed the Britain of food banks, the homeless, payday loans, bedroom tax and zero-hours jobs. The Conservatives’ pitch in 2010 had been repairing “broken Britain”, but its cracks were widened by an austerity that was neither necessary nor inevitable but resulted from ideological choices. The cap on housing benefit created socially segregated no-go areas for low earners. Councils lost a third of their spending power: buses, planning, housing, youth services and sports facilities were cut or sold off. Nature suffered: Natural England, custodian of flora and fauna in national parks, lost half its budget and shed 1,000 inspectors. Eleven million trees were promised, 1.4m planted.One service always in the public eye was the NHS. But its 2010 training cuts left it short of 100,000 nurses and doctors. Spending time with the chief executive of Ipswich hospital, we watched as he begged a senior nurse not to leave. Jenny (not her real name), one of his best, brightest and most dedicated nurses, had turned around his difficult chemotherapy ward, caring for seriously ill people feeling at their worst, where deaths of patients exacted a heavy emotional toll on staff. But, taking a deep breath, she told him: “I just can’t keep going.” She would join the nursing bank for occasional shifts, but her departure would add to the 41,000 nurse vacancies. Her team cried when she told them.The public realm now employs a smaller proportion of the workforce than at any time since 1945. For every £100 for public services in 2010, only £86 in real terms was spent in 2020. Rebuilding schools and hospitals stopped dead. A quarter of local government jobs vanished, with youth workers tackling knife crime the first to go. Criminal justice was hard hit: courts closed prisons overflowed with violence and drug abuse rife legal aid was pared to nothing. The armed forces were not spared. Grants to arts organisations fell by a third, funding for national galleries and museums by a half.It is a perverse society that chooses to harm its youngest most, but years of frozen benefits left families thousands of pounds short, while the old saw their triple-locked pensions rise. State spending per child fell from £11,300 to £10,000. Early intervention for families was so scarce that the numbers of children in care rose fast. Psychiatrists estimated that one in five girls and young women had cut, burned or poisoned themselves in deliberate acts of self-harm on a rising trend: waiting lists for help stretched to a year in some places. Children deprived at school of art, music and drama teaching have lost that chance for ever, with only half taking any arts exams, and trips out severely cut. In 2018, 130 libraries shut and 760 youth clubs closed. This year begins with a million lost young people classified as “Neet” not in employment or education.Child poverty soared to its highest level since before the second world war. Infant mortality rose for the first time in two generations. The Thomas Coram Research Institute collected children’s own accounts: “I was so hungry, it was like I got hit in my belly, like I got stabbed with a knife,” 14-year-old Emmanuel told it. The threshold for claiming free school meals halved. More than 2,000 food banks opened, four times more in districts where universal credit – one of the decade’s greatest, but by no means only, disasters – was rolled out. Ministers’ talk of “scroungers” hardened public hearts. In Knowsley, on Merseyside, a food bank organiser collecting donations was asked: “Is this for English people?” He replied: “It’s for hungry people.”Of course, these years were not monochrome. Plenty of good happened because people are admirably resilient: we found enterprise, generosity and public servants holding it all together with superhuman effort. Despite cuts to subsidies, renewable energy outdid expectations. Film studios flourished, UK acting grabbed glittering prizes and athletes triumphed. But everywhere decaying high streets were a metaphor for national malaise, as internet retail sucked the life out of bricks-and-mortar shops, its US owners paying negligible tax to compensate.At the other end of the scale, the decade’s winners won big. Jeff Fairburn of Persimmon’s £75m bonus was emblematic profits poured into his pockets from a misdirected “help to buy” subsidy. Total wealth in second homes, buy-to-lets and flats on the Costa climbed to £941bn. The UK still had more highly paid bankers than the rest of the EU put together. As GDP and pay growth both slowed, profits rose. A third of the UK’s billionaires kept their money in tax havens: the May government backed off from forcing transparency on crown dependencies and, coincidentally, tax exiles donated handsomely to the Conservative party’s 2017 election costs. HMRC cut local offices at the expense of precious local knowledge, a Sheffield accountant told us. Amid austerity, 15,600 tax collectors were dispensed with and the NAO reported 4m calls to HMRC went unanswered £35bn went uncollected.British business stayed virtually mute on Brexit, in self-harming silence, fearing public scrutiny of its stratospheric director remuneration, dysfunctional boardrooms and negligent auditors. The small businesspeople we spoke to were often pro-Brexit, refusing to see any bigger picture. A Dartmoor sheep farmer and a Hastings fisherman stayed believers, despite not expecting Brexit to do them much good. A steel stockholder in Derby and a high-street butcher saw turnover drop but stayed true to the faith. Never mind expert reckoning that the Brexit vote was losing Britain £700m a week taking back control stirred feelings more ineffable than money.Andy Brooke in Derby had his own bespoke bike business when we first met him, full of hope for the future of his highly specialised service for serious contenders. His shop seemed the perfect spot, near where the council was building a velodrome. But the Brexit vote left uncertainty among his clients from Derby’s big companies. “Overnight, people became very, very careful with their money,” he said. Nationwide, bike sales went down. “Before the referendum, we’d been selling two bikes a week, but now it was down to two a month.” He went bust, his company filing for insolvency. Derby council’s velodrome suffered a similar fate: it made a heavy loss. “This has been a hard time for me,” said Brooke. “I got married and I was busy organising the wedding at the same time as I was dealing with the shop’s bankruptcy.” Looking back, he was rueful. “I was so uplifted by the 2012 Olympics. That showed us off as a great multicultural hub, welcoming everyone. Then came the referendum, so many political lies. Now the country’s creeping in the wrong direction.” So he is emigrating to the US, a young remainer despairing of Britain. “I’ve been offered something in sports science in the US. We want children, but we don’t want to bring them up here any more, not in this atmosphere.”Brexit was mainly caused by the partisan austerity created by the shrinking of the public sphere by Conservative governments. To win power, Johnson promised to repair his party’s depredations with eye-catching projects. His Brexit rhetoric has raised expectations, but his commitment to “levelling up” is a deceit unless it reverses all the financial and social forces that have been accelerating poverty since 2010.The lost decade was a Tory decade and perhaps the next one will be, too.

The England and Wales Cricket Board has announced that both competitions will be worth £300,000 in prize money, with the winning men’s and women’s teams earning £150,000 each, the runners-up £75,000, as well an even split for various player awards.The governing body has described the prize pool as “a step towards the long-term commitment to making cricket a gender-balanced sport”, as part of a pledge to invest £20m in the women’s game in the next two years including 40 professional contracts. The matched prize money also mirrors the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup where, like the men’s tournament in October, the winning team in Melbourne on Sunday will take home £770,000. Australia’s Big Bash League also has a total prize pot of £335,000 shared evenly across the men’s and women’s competitions.Like both these short-form tournaments there is a caveat in terms of the wage disparity in the Hundred, where the average contract for female players is £8,000 compared to £66,600 for the men. This gulf was highlighted when eight female marquee players were named last October – including the Australia captain Meg Lanning and South Africa’s Dane van Neikerk – on deals worth £15,000 each, less combined than the £125,000 one top-tier male player makes.The ECB acknowledges the gap, at least, and insists the eight-team tournament is aimed at closing this gap over time depending on the success of the new eight-team 100-ball format.Beth Barrett-Wild, head of the Hundred women’s competition, said: “While we’re aware there is more to do in this space, this is an important step in the right direction. It’s recognition for the women’s players and the huge value they bring to the Hundred.“The ECB is committed to transforming women’s and girls’ cricket, from inspiring young girls to pick up a bat for the first time, through to establishing the women’s game as a professional career option. This announcement today represents one signal of intent towards that commitment.”“Women’s professional cricket is on an exciting journey and whilst, there is still a way to go to realise gender-parity, this move from The Hundred is a significant step in the right direction.”Prize money (men and women)Winning team\u0026nbsp£150,000Runners-up £75,000Third place\u0026nbsp£50,000MVP\u0026nbsp£10,000Leading runs\u0026nbsp£5,000Leading wickets\u0026nbsp£5,000Leading fielder\u0026nbsp£5,000Salary bandsMen\u0026nbsp£125,000, £100,000, £75,000, £60,000, £50,000, £40,000, £30,000.\u0026nbspCaptaincy bonus\u0026nbsp£10,000Women\u0026nbsp£15,000, £12,000, £9,000, £7,200, £6,000, £4,800 and £3,600.\u0026nbspCaptaincy bonus: £1,200"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c7c29391c0dd870b9465b4a65606fe89f1e803/0_51_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64c3d24e0dccc4890330a8e35a68a165","title":"talking horses foxhunter offers loxton trio of chances for golden festival","story":"Rose Loxton has three runners in the Foxhunter Chase at Cheltenham and victory would be a welcome change of luckWhile the racing world occupies its thoughts with the running plans of Willie Mullins and Gordon Elliott in the buildup to next week’s Cheltenham Festival, a more modest yard near the Somerset village of Bruton is quietly preparing for its biggest day yet.Rose Loxton, who used to show up in a lot of pictures alongside Kauto Star and Big Buck’s during her years working for Paul Nicholls, is planning to have no fewer than three runners in the Foxhunter Chase on Friday week, giving her a serious chance of a first success in jump racing’s biggest week.“I don’t even want to think about it,” she says, having answered the phone while riding out on Tuesday morning. “I’ve only got two racing bridles, I’m going to have to borrow one from Paul.”Victory would be an extremely welcome change of luck because Loxton has been in the wars. A horror fall in November 2018 sent her to hospital in an air ambulance with a laundry list of injuries and, while she was being treated, doctors discovered she was also suffering from cancer.Showing the toughness for which jump-racing folk are known, Loxton, born and raised on the Galway coast, is inclined to look for the positives. “If I hadn’t fallen off a horse, I would never have found out I had cancer.“I’ve had lots of treatment, I’ve had operations and I’m still going in every three weeks to have what they call a management drug. That goes on for another three or four months, I think. Fingers crossed, the doctors seem really happy.“It’s not something you can cure. It’s something you just keep under the thumb. I’m so busy with the horses, I hardly think about it.“It just seemed such a simple fall, but I kind of fell under the horse and then he tripped over me. I had a compound fracture of my right leg, a broken collar bone and a few ribs and I punctured my lung.“About a month after the accident, I still had my leg in a cast but I just had to get on a horse, to see if I could, so I rode around the roads. The children were furious.”The horse who did the damage, Earth Leader, is the least fancied of Loxton’s three intended runners next week. The others are Caid Du Berlais, to be ridden by the vastly experienced Will Biddick, and Shantou Flyer, whose owner-jockey, David Maxwell, would not claim to be as skilled as Biddick but has still been able to rack up 18 wins on his various horses this season.Maxwell switched Shantou Flyer to Loxton’s yard after the pair finished a fine second in last year’s Foxhunter, perhaps hoping a change of scenery would help the horse make up the necessary ground on Hazel Hill, who beat them last March. Loxton, who has had a winner at the Punchestown Festival in each of the last two years, is quietly upbeat.“I don’t want to be a tipster but if Shantou Flyer is well and fit, you’d think he’d have to have a serious chance. And Caid, if he can get up the hill, I’d love to see him placed.“It would be awesome to win, a dream come true. It’s the sort of thing you think about when you first get into racing. I mean, I can remember rushing home from school to watch the racing when I was young and thinking, gosh, it’s Cheltenham.”Nicholls, who is likely to run Alcala in the Foxhunter, says of Loxton: “She’s an amazing lady and you can see how the horses keep her going. She was here for a lot of years, she was head girl, and she still rides out when she can. She deserves all the success she gets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3efa784912d670529d562d91d9044ee8db79e878/787_519_4055_2433/master/4055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea7c59c7a70c0952a34f7d4a4e17749d","title":"the last quiz night on earth review immersive pub drama","story":"Hope Mill theatre, ManchesterAn asteroid is hurtling towards Earth in Alison Carr’s new play, where everyone takes part in a pub quizThe local boozer might not be a bad place to wait for the impending apocalypse. At least, that’s the premise of Alison Carr’s new play, in which the end is nigh but the beer is still flowing.As an asteroid hurtles towards Earth, the punters of the Four Horsemen (get it?) are brandishing their pens for one final quiz night. Or rather, we are. In Box of Tricks’ immersive production, the audience are the pub regulars, dusting off our general knowledge and also competing for the title of best team name. In between quiz rounds, characters try to right old regrets and settle old scores as time ticks down to oblivion.There are some witty nuggets of dialogue in Carr’s script, delivered with easy charm by the cast of four. Meriel Scholfield’s Kathy, landlady of the Four Horsemen, holds everything together, always ready with a commiserating drink and a sharp reply. Our quizmaster for the night is Rav, loud and lovable as played by Shaban Dar, while Amy Drake and Chris Jack both make suitably dramatic entrances as unexpected blasts from the past.There’s a light touch to Hannah Tyrrell-Pinder’s direction and Katie Scott’s design, using small details to evoke the pub setting. Seated around tables, spectators quickly embrace the spirit of the event, scribbling down answers. The pedestrian familiarity of the set-up makes an enjoyably absurd contrast with the subject matter.But the blend of quiz and drama doesn’t quite do justice to either. The mixed format creates some awkward moments, as exchanges between the actors get lost under enthusiastic chatter. Squeezed in between rounds of questions and answers, the main content of the play is slight, playing on the predictable end-of-the-world themes of reunion, repentance and regret. Cliche is never far away.As a variation on your typical pub quiz, Box of Tricks’ production is an entertaining enough evening. But as an imagining of Armageddon, The Last Quiz Night on Earth brings little that’s new or surprising to an already well-rehearsed scenario."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/226cafa816027d28dcff336073fc15b666e08cc9/766_447_3689_2214/master/3689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a8c830667182561b6469bf0867419e6","title":"marshall monitor ii anc review classic headphones gain noise cancelling wireless battery","story":"Comfortable, durable, wireless headphones with long battery life and signature soundMarshall’s second iteration of its top Monitor wireless headphones add active noise cancellation and up to 45 hours of battery life while keeping their classic looks.Marshall brand headphones combine powerful, distinctive sound with a classic look reminiscent of the company’s guitar amps. The £280 Monitor II ANC are no exception.The headphones fully enclose your ear with medium-sized cups, comfortable pads and a firm but evenly distributed grip on your head. The headband is lined with leatherette-covered foam and does a good job of staying put without too much pressure on your skull.Despite being Marshall’s largest headphones, the Monitor II are comparatively small and discreet with a relatively low profile on your head that’s very welcome. The ear cups are held by sturdy-feeling metal arms with a full range of articulation that slide in and out of the headband, clicking into place for a comfortable fit.They fold up in a number of different ways, making them some of the most compact and easy to pack full-size headphones for travelling.Marshall’s best-in-class control joystick returns. Press it in for pauseplay, up and down for volume, or left and right for track skip. Why others don’t copy this brilliant method of controls on headphones I have no idea.Two buttons on the back hinges of the ear cups take care of noise-cancelling modes and switching the equaliser between three user-selectable pre-sets. Press the noise-cancelling button to switch between active noise cancelling (ANC) and ambient sound modes or press and hold to turn it off.The headphones have a traditional 3.5mm socket and ship with a detachable cable that can be used with or without the power on.The Bluetooth connection to an iPhone 11 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and OnePlus 7 Pro 5G was strong and skip-free. But Marshall has taken a backward step, only supporting the most basic SBC Bluetooth audio codec.All Apple, Android and Windows devices support the improved AAC codec, while the latter pair also support aptX: a more advanced codec Marshall used in previous headphones. The better the Bluetooth audio codec, the higher the quality of audio. Thankfully, I saw no lip-sync problems with any of the common video-playing apps across Android, iOS and even YouTube in Microsoft’s Edge browser on Windows 10.Call quality was good. The recipient’s voice came through clear and loud in the headphones, while my voice was audible with a good amount of sidetone. The other end of the call said my voice was loud, clear and crisp, even if a little background noise seeped in intermittently.ANC uses inverse sound waves to cancel out unwanted noise before it hits your eardrum and has become bare minimum for high-end wireless headphones.By default, ANC is turned up to maximum on the headphones but you can turn it down in the Marshall app if you want more awareness of your surroundings. It works fine for cancelling out the rumble of an engine, and fairly well on road noise, but it is not very good at dealing with speech, meaning they are not the best for simply concentrating in an office or blocking out noisy commuters.The headphones also struggle to deal with wind noise, making listening to music in a gusty environment difficult. Turning off noise cancelling was the best option.Overall, Bose, B\u0026ampW and Sony have nothing to fear here, so if super-effective noise cancelling is your primary driver, best to look elsewhere.Marshall’s headphones have a particular sound that people love. Often they are best suited to rock, with a raw, grungy sound that’s exciting and full of energy. The Monitor II headphones also have that sound but are better at dealing with other genres of music, too, sounding almost as good with driving electronica or background lounge, while giving large orchestral scores a good go.The “Marshall sound” equaliser is active by default, which produces their best sound with an overall warm tone, fairly controlled bass and full-blooded mids, while highs are a little muted in places. The soundscape is surprisingly wide, giving a good immersive listening experience for big pieces, while there is a good amount of separation between instruments and tones keeping things clear when tracks get a bit intense.They do not quite rival the very best, such as B\u0026ampW’s PX7, but if you like Marshall’s warm, rock-focused sound, you will love the Monitor II.Battery life is so long you may forget you ever have to charge them. The Monitor II headphones are designed to last up to 30 hours with noise cancelling active and 45 hours with it off, which seemed a little conservative in my testing.That is easily enough to cover any flight or most weekly commutes without needing to charge. They take two hours to fully charge via USB-C but a 15-minute top-up will add about five hours playback if you do happen to forget to charge them.You cannot use the USB-C port for audio but you can charge them and listen to them at the same time.The headphones are not made from any recycled material but are made from responsibly sourced materials.The Marshall Monitor II ANC are a set of rocking headphones that look every bit the part.Despite being full-sized headphones, they are fairly slimline, with classic styling that sets them apart. They are robust, fold up to be much more compact than rivals and are far more comfortable than many – if you want to rock out for hours on end, they have the fit to make sure you can last as long as their 30 to 45-hour battery will.They have a sound that is slightly more refined than previous Marshall headphones, making them sound good for a wider range of genres, but the warm sound is still best with a trashing guitar packing plenty of punch and raw energy.They are not perfect, though. The active noise cancellation works for general drone but struggles with voices. They only support the standard SBC Bluetooth audio standard, not higher quality codecs practically every device is capable of using such as AAC or aptX, which is a backward step for the brand.They are certainly not cheap, and you can get a similar Marshall experience from the brand’s excellent Major III series of headphones for about half the price, but the Monitor II ANC are a warm, inviting listen that’s hard to put down.Pros: look great, fold down really compact, comfortable for very long listening sessions, long battery life, brilliant controls, great sound, decent noise cancelling, headphone socket, stable Bluetooth connectionCons: only SBC, expensive, noise cancelling struggles with wind and voices This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Now, even more improbably, Joe Biden – who, at 77, is the youngest man in the race for the Democratic nomination – has risen like Lazarus to win eight states on Super Tuesday and become the frontrunner.“We are very much alive!” he told rejoicing supporters in Los Angeles.It was one of the stunning reversals in recent political history. Less than a month ago Biden slunk away from New Hampshire with his tail between his legs even before the votes were counted. When he trailed in fifth, political obituaries were written. Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist, told the : “For him to recover from this would be a political miracle unlike anything we’ve seen in modern presidential politics.”The conventional wisdom was that Super Tuesday – when a third of Democratic primary delegates (who eventually nominate the candidate at the party’s national convention in July) are decided – would not be a question of can Senator Bernie Sanders win, but how big will his lead be.But last week, everything changed. It started with James Clyburn, who is African American and became a member of the House of Representatives in 1993. Attending his accountant’s funeral, Clyburn was stopped by an older woman near the front of the church. “Young man, I want you to whisper in my ear who you are voting for,” she told him.It was the pivotal moment because it established Biden’s credibility, electability and viability for the moderate wing of the party. It was clear that he – not the billionaire former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg or the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar – stood the best chance of defeating first Bernie Sanders, then Donald Trump in November’s election.It was time for moderates to get in line, especially after Sanders’s comments in a TV interview – acknowledging Cuba’s literacy programme, “Is that a bad thing, even if Fidel Castro did it?” – crystallised their fear of an electoral car crash. Buttigieg remarked: “I don’t want as a Democrat to be explaining why our nominee is encouraging people to look on the bright side of the Castro regime when we are going into the election of our lives.”On Monday Buttigieg and Klobuchar duly quit the race and endorsed Biden, avoiding the fatal error of Republicans who failed to unite against Donald Trump in 2016. The former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, the ex-senator Harry Reid and the former national security adviser Susan Rice did so too. Suddenly, Super Tuesday would pit Sanders against the centrist Avengers.“Yes, the moderates are consolidating,” said comedian Stephen Colbert. “We are reaching extreme levels of centrism.”South Carolina proved a blueprint, not an outlier, as Biden looked on course to win the most delegates on Super Tuesday. African Americans in the south, moderates and suburbanites supported him in droves. Counter-intuitively, it was his coalition that boosted turnout, whereas so far in 2020, Sanders has failed to expand his base. A massive surge in Virginia worked in Biden’s favour, a clue as to why Trump has long been wary of him.He added: “Joe Biden brings predictability and security and stability and represents a course correction. People don’t want a radical extreme. They want to wake up and feel good about the country again.”Tuesday’s results also proved Hollywood screenwriter William Goldman’s maxim that “Nobody knows anything”. Democrats have held 10 televised presidential debates, with Buttigieg, California senator Kamala Harris, Klobuchar and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren notching wins and Biden performing terribly. But in the end, all that talking and sparring counted for nothing. There were five states where Biden did not campaign, and where Sanders and Bloomberg built big operations, yet which Biden still won.Momentum, or “Joementum” as his campaign calls it, beat money. It is, once again, a humbling reminder that most voters are not tuned into every debate or every twist and turn of Twitter. Go to any Trump rally and ask about the latest Washington scandal and you will often be met by blank stares or so-what? shrugs.But Super Tuesday has been clarifying in two other ways: one uplifting, one sad. First, money can’t buy you the presidency: Bloomberg had splashed out half a billion dollars and got hammered. Second, the glass ceiling has been reinforced and America will again not elect a female president: Elizabeth Warren could not even win her home state of Massachusetts. Both will face renewed pressure to withdraw.So what began as the biggest, most erse field history is now a two-person race that looks a lot like 2016: a moderate establishment Democrat representing a third term of Obama versus the leftwing populist Sanders. It should come as no surprise that voting patterns are broadly similar, with Sanders galvanising young people hungry for change but struggling to win over older voters in the suburbs.Hillary Clinton ran up the score on Super Tuesday in 2016 yet the primary dragged on, bitterly and isively, and she eventually lost to Trump. With Sanders taking California, Colorado and Vermont on Tuesday, there is an even greater chance of a long drawn out fight this time, possibly ending in a contested convention. And even if Biden prevails, his age and gaffes could prove a liability.The original comeback kid, Bill Clinton, was 45 at the time of his resurgence in the New Hampshire primary, a fresh face like Jimmy Carter before him and Barack Obama after him. Clinton is now 73 – which still makes him four years younger than Biden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36f4a3b1fd0aae66495b5d2541e3a7f24f449174/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d8cd55a17cec24c5ed251b04cd3067a 480w","title":"super tuesday 2020 live news bernie sanders joe biden california texas primaries latest updates","story":"Meanwhile people are still voting in California and Texas, which have been plagued by long lines and delays. In California and Texas anyone in line at the time polls close must be allowed to vote.The US has an ongoing problem with long lines on polling day – much of it linked to deliberate voter suppression.  reported yesterday that Texas leads the US south in closing down the most polling stations. Here’s more on what would probably be a nightmare for Democrats: a contested convention.This is basically when no candidate gets a majority on the first ballot, and party bigwigs (“superdelegates”) get to swing in and take part in another round of voting.Sanders’ supporters fear that even if he was ahead in the first round, the superdelegates would hand the nomination to Biden. Adam Gabbatt has the full details:We’re in the middle of the race to decide which Democrat will face Donald Trump in the US presidential election in November. Each state gets a vote, and yesterday a big group of states – including two of the largest, California and Texas – got to have their say. Bernie Sanders, the leftwing senator from Vermont, had been the favourite since his landslide victory in Nevada in February, but former vice-president Joe Biden’s win in South Carolina and the withdrawal of Biden’s fellow centrists Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar meant it suddenly became an extremely close-run thing.Sanders was hoping to fend off Biden and cement his status as indisputable frontrunner. Biden was hoping for a strong enough showing to make the case that he can pull ahead of Sanders, unite the centrist wing, and eventually win the race. Biden had a great night and has probably reclaimed his former status as frontrunner from Sanders. He won in at least nine of the 14 states up for grabs, including Texas, and he beat Elizabeth Warren, another leftwing contender, in Massachusetts, her home state. But Sanders looks to be way ahead in California. Once all the delegates are ided up – which could take days or weeks – Sanders could end up coming out of Super Tuesday with a very similar number of delegates to his centrist rival.What seems clear is that this is now a two-horse race between Sanders and Biden.No … The race goes on. There is another set of primaries next week which Sanders hopes will give him another boost. But it may be that Sanders and Biden now slug it out state by state, week after week, all the way to the Democratic convention in July. If no candidate has got a majority of delegates by the time of the convention, party bigwigs get to play a role. Most of them are terrified of Sanders winning and they are likely to give the crown to Biden – even if Sanders is ahead at that point. If that happens, Sanders’ supporters will be absolutely furious and many may refuse to vote for Biden in the general election. The former New York mayor has spent about half a billion dollars on his campaign ads so far – a record-breaking amount. But he’s worth $60bn. To put that in context, that’s the equivalent of someone whose net worth is $100 grand, say, spending $400 on the election. It’s not nothing, but it’s nowhere close to breaking the bank for him. That said, there will be a great deal of pressure on him now to give way and back Biden too. He won his first two elections as mayor of New York as a Republican and he is not a fan of Sanders and his socialist platform, to put it mildly. He is apparently planning to hunker down with his advisers on Wednesday and decide what to do next. On paper Warren could have been the ideal candidate to unite the liberal and centrist wings of the party but she only really cut through in her powerful attacks on Bloomberg. She has been squeezed out by Sanders on the left, and it’s hard to escape the conclusion that sexism has also played a role. Her campaign suggested last week that she would keep fighting and hope to be handed the crown at the convention if Sanders fails to win a majority of delegates. But that may be untenable and after coming third in her home state this is probably the end of the road for her. The big question is whether she will throw her weight behind Sanders or Biden. Liberals have often fantasised about Sanders making Warren his vice-president and you’ll hear a lot about that again now. Whether he will or not I don’t know, but I’d say it’s a near-certainty that both Sanders and Biden intend to choose a female VP if they get that far. Donald Trump has shown a keen interest in the Democratic race and kept up a running commentary on Twitter. He constantly tears into Biden and Bloomberg on Twitter, but is much kinder to Sanders – stirring the pot by claiming that the Democratic establishment is rigging the race against the Vermont socialist. It seems clear that he wants Sanders to win the race and thinks he’d beat him. The primaries continue next week with contests in Michigan, Mississippi and Washington state, among other places. But this is looking like a battle between Bernie and Biden that will go down to the wire – so we may still be talking about this contest in July.Oliver Laughland has just left the Texas Democratic party headquarters in Austin after a long night, just as Joe Biden declared a major victory for his campaign there.Texas is the second largest state to vote on Super Tuesday with 228 pledged delegates at stake here.It’s worth noting that while Biden has been declared the victor this evening, it’s the margin of victory that really matters as that will determine (via a number of complicated processes) just how many delegates Biden picks up. The executive director of the Texas Democrats, Manny Garcia came to give us (and by us I mean the last three reporters left in the building) a quick briefing before he headed home. He said he expects the delegate count to be declared early Wednesday afternoon as the party waits for full results to come in from Texas’s 254 counties, all of which administer their own elections here. Garcia also spent a significant amount of time addressing the long lines at various polling stations throughout the state, an issue that could come to plague the party at the general election, where the party see a small opportunity to make this deep red state competitive. In a statement the party hailed the high turnout that characterized this primary, but argued the long lines - some of which left voters queuing past 11pm - underline the need for state electoral reform. “We need major improvements across the board: more resources to assist county and state elections officials and increased access to voting. This year will see the highest turnout in Texas history with millions of new voters casting their ballots. We cannot have these long waits happen again in November,” the statement says.This is Paul Owen taking the reins after the Super Tuesday Democratic primaries – probably the most consequential night of the 2020 presidential race so far.Joe Biden has officially been declared the winner of the Texas primary, narrowly edging out Bernie Sanders in the delegate-rich state.The AP called the race moments ago, about five hours after most of Texas’ polling places closed.Texas was considered one of the biggest prizes of the night, not just because of its 228 pledged delegates but also because of how the state’s results were expected to reflect larger dynamics in the fight for the Democratic nomination:Joe Biden declared victory in Texas, even though the AP has not yet called the state.The former vice president celebrated the Texas results in a tweet that parodied the logo of the popular burger chain Whataburger, where Biden stopped with former rival-turned-endorser Beto O’Rourke last night:Looking ahead to the next contests: six states will hold primaries next Tuesday, March 10.Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington will head to the polls and collextively award 352 pledged delegates.It could be a good night for Bernie Sanders, considering he won Idaho, Michigan, North Dakota and Washington in 2016.But a new poll showed Sanders falling nearly 7 points behind Joe Biden in Michigan, the most delegate-rich state holding a primary next week.Bernie Sanders is also losing a key argument for his candidacy tonight: that he can increase turnout more than any of his competitors.The state of Virginia, where Joe Biden won decisively, offered a harsh reality check on Sanders’ talking point tonight.Virginia has been viewed as a crucial swing state in recent years, but it has become increasngly Democratic as the state’s DC suburbs lean more to the left.Tonight, the turnout in Virginia was nearly double that of the 2016 Democratic primary between Sanders and Hillary Clinton. The result of that increased turnout? Sanders lost to Biden by about 30 points.Joe Biden’s team pointed to his victories tonight as evidence of his popularity among Democratic voters.When asked how the former vice-president had managed to win in states he had paid almost no attention to, like Tennessee, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told CNN, “It is the power of Joe Biden. It is the fact that people know him.”On the flip side, Biden’s success tonight raises questions about the effectiveness of Mike Bloomberg’s massive advertising spending and Elizabeth Warren’s vast field organization:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/435bc8141659837bca3a5d98a965229d2c12d9c1/0_0_1630_978/master/1630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7a8440822308426436c5bbe4939a10c","title":"super tuesday results primaries democratic delegates live","story":"More than a third of available delegates are up for grabs in Democratic primaries, with potential for one candidate to claim frontrunner statusThere were 52 pledged delegates up for grabs in Alabama’s Democratic presidential primary vote, where the opioid crisis, healthcare and government corruption rank among the top voting issues.

The others had been to Singapore, Japan and Iran, suggesting none are believed to have contracted the virus in the UK.Health officials in the Canary Islands reported the first case of a British national testing positive at a quarantined hotel in Tenerife.The 12 new UK cases constitute the second highest single-day increase in cases to date. They include the first known cases in Hampshire, Humberside and Northamptonshire. Others are from London, Wirral, Greater Manchester and Kent.Dr Will Welfare, of Public Health England North West, said there were three new Covid-19 cases in Greater Manchester, including two from Bury.“As a result of contact tracing we know the new Bury cases announced today are known contacts of the previously confirmed case from Bury,” he said. “The third case is a resident of Bolton which is not linked to the two cases in Bury announced today.

Last week the family made it to the safety of Antakya, just over the Turkish border. Dancing around her new home in a pink princess dress, for the first time in her life Salwa doesn’t have to listen to the sounds of the conflict.Abdullah is giddy with relief. “Now we don’t have to be afraid any more,” he said. “Salwa has a completely different future.”The family were very lucky to be invited to Turkey rather than having to pay smugglers thousands of dollars and then dodge the bullets of border guards. There are 3 million other people still trapped by a three-month-old campaign by the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and his Russian allies to seize back north-western Idlib province, the last opposition stronghold in the country.Russian airpower has emptied towns and villages of civilians and fighters, allowing the Syrian army and allied Iranian-backed militias to surge forwards and capture swathes of territory.While Damascus and Moscow say they are targeting jihadist factions not covered by a 2018 deescalation deal, the UN says the aerial bombardment and shelling has killed more than 130 civilians in February alone, with dozens of hospitals and schools hit. More than 900,000 people have left their homes, most of them fleeing north to the relative safety of the Turkish border, in what is now the worst humanitarian crisis of the nine-year-old war to date.The threat of a potential new influx of millions of refugees led Turkey, which supports some of the rebel groups, to beef up its presence in Idlib, sending thousands of troops and convoys of equipment in an attempt to repel the regime advance.That in turn led to an escalation in tensions between Ankara and Moscow after at least 33 Turkish troops were killed in an airstrike last Thursday. While Turkey, a Nato member, officially blamed the Syrian regime for the attack, sources on the ground suggest the strike was actually carried out by the Russian air force.Since then the Turks have vented their fury on Assad’s forces, destroying dozens of tanks, howitzers and air defence systems in what has been in effect a declaration of war on the regime. On Tuesday, Turkish F-16s roared over the hilly Bab al-Hawa border crossing into Idlib, where they took down a fourth Syrian jet.The intense fighting is likely to get worse over the next few days as the parties scramble for maximum leverage before talks on Thursday between the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.“Turkish drones, artillery and surface-to-surface missiles have pushed the regime back,” said Omar Saad, a fighter with the Turkish-backed National Front group. “It’s the first time ever I’ve seen Assad soldiers being hunted by aerial strikes the way they kill civilians. It’s justice. And every warplane downed means civilian lives are saved.”Otherwise, the Turkish side of the border zone is deceptively quiet. Stray dogs sleep beneath blossoming apricot trees and sheep roam the hillside. Shops in the border town of Reyhanlı have put up Turkish flags in solidarity with the operation.Bab al-Hawa has seen a steady stream of military vehicles and aid trucks, as well as a quick show of support from the US special representative to Syria, James Jeffrey, and the US ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft, during a visit to the Atmeh displacement camp on Tuesday.The traffic is almost entirely one way: Turks go in but few Syrians are allowed to come out, usually those with pre-existing travel permits for medical care. The sprawling misery of Atmeh on the other side of the wire may as well be a million miles away.The situation is the opposite of the scene unfolding on the other side of the country, at Turkey’s borders with the EU. Following the strike on Turkish troops, Ankara declared it would no longer stop migrants from trying to cross into Europe – a move designed to pressure western allies to support the Turkish campaign in Idilb.Since then the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) estimates at least 13,000 people have travelled west to try their luck. One Syrian baby drowned after a boat capsized while trying to reach the Greek island of Lesbos, and one man from Aleppo died after being shot in the throat with a rubber bullet allegedly fired by Greek border guards.That the new crisis on the fringes of the EU is manufactured is made all the more apparent by the fact that Turkey’s southern border with Syria remains shut.Abdulnaser al-Desh, stuck in Atmeh camp, does not have the money – $3,000 per person – that smugglers demand to get his wife and three children to Turkey.“We heard that Turkey is going to open the border with Idlib but it’s still closed. They just opened the European side,” he said. “We are being used as bargaining chips. It is humiliating to be treated like a disease which no one wants.”Salwa’s father, Abdullah, says he feels guilty his family managed to escape while so many in Syria are still suffering. “I feel bad to leave my siblings and Salwa’s cousins and grandfather behind. At the same time though, it is not too much to ask for a life where you are treated like a human being. I can take Salwa to the park every day.

Welcome to Viktor Orbán’s drive to get Hungarian women to breed: “family-friendly Hungary”, in the words of the giant banners that now greet arrivals at Budapest airport.Across Europe, as falling birthrates lead to projections of shrinking populations, policymakers are pondering a question: can we pay people to have more children?Countries with rightwing populist governments have taken the lead in answering with a resounding yes, as boosting fertility dovetails with their anti-migration and “family values” talking points. Nowhere is the campaign to get women to have more children more intense than in Orbán’s Hungary. The country’s fertility rate – the average number of children per woman – reached an all-time low of 1.23 in 2011 and remains well below the level of 2.1 that is required for population levels to remain constant.It follows neatly on from the government’s relentless anti-migration message of the past five years. “In all of Europe there are fewer and fewer children, and the answer of the west to this is migration,” said Orbán in his annual state of the nation address last year. “They want as many migrants to enter as there are missing kids, so that the numbers will add up. We Hungarians have a different way of thinking. Instead of just numbers, we want Hungarian children. Migration for us is surrender.”Newly nationalised IVF clinics will offer free treatment cycles for all women who want them (as long as they are under 40 and not lesbian), and Orbán recently promised to extend the lifetime exemption from income tax to include mothers with three children.Most strikingly of all, various loans offer money upfront, based on a future promise to have children. One of these loans provides 10 million forint (£25,400) to young married couples. Each time a child is born, payments are deferred. If the couple have three children within the requisite timeframe, the loan is written off. If they don’t, they have to pay it back.Bettina, a 32-year-old teaching assistant from the village of Mágocs, in southern Hungary, is planning to take out the “baby-expecting loan” in March. She and her husband, a policeman, already have one child and are planning another. “The loan is brilliant. If it wasn’t for this help then we would have to live with one of our parents, or in terrible conditions,” she said.The couple already have a 1.4 million forint loan, taken out soon after their marriage and contingent on having two children within a six-year timeframe. “We are trying hard for another baby now but as the term approaches it does increase the pressure,” she admitted.This is Europe is a new stream of  journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. The kindergarten caters for four villages, including neighbouring Alsómocsolád, which during the communist period had its own kindergarten and school. It has long closed, and now there is just an old-people’s home. “Every year at Christmas we give the kids presents and it’s noticeable that the number now is so much less than it was in the nineties,” said László Dicső, the long-standing mayor of Alsómocsolád. In the countryside, the lack of young children is even more starkly felt, as the lower fertility rates are amplified by the migration of people to the cities and abroad.Across Europe, governments have introduced benefits aimed at stimulating population growth. In Poland, the ruling Law and Justice party introduced the 500+ policy in 2016, under which mothers received 500 złoty (£99) per child per month from the second child onwards. Last year it was expanded to include all children.In Russia, a one-off payment of £5,800 to families with two or more children was launched in 2007. In January, Vladimir Putin announced a new package of demographic measures that will cost 400bn roubles (£4.7bn) per year. “Russia’s fate and its historic prospects depend on how many of us there are … it depends on how many children are born in Russian families,” said Putin when announcing the policy. Italy and Greece have also introduced “baby bonuses” for each child.In the western half of Europe, fertility rates dropped gradually over several decades as more women entered the workforce and began to postpone having children. In the post-communist states, the change happened differently. There was a sudden drop in fertility after the collapse of communism, brought on not by the social changes but by economic misery and social collapse. At a time when the future was uncertain, childbearing was postponed and birthrates fell precipitously.Over the next years, as the economies of the post-communist states recovered and grew, the same dynamics that had gradually changed the rates over many years in western Europe kicked in, meaning the rates did not recover.“There has been a change in mentality, maybe it’s a western influence. The young generation that is now 30, they have gone to university and want to start having children much later. This means they will have fewer children,” said Simonics.In central and eastern Europe, the falling birthrates have been exacerbated by large numbers of people moving westward in search of work, combined with minimal inward migration . In Hungary and other populist-led countries, the shrinking populations have been painted in apocalyptic terms of national survival.A set of global population projections released by the UN in 2017 did little to allay fears. The study projected that the combined population of 10 eastern European countries would fall from 292 million then to 218 million in 2100, while during the same period the population of west Africa would grow from 372 million to 1.6 billion.“Europe has become the continent of the empty crib whereas in Asia and Africa they face demographic challenges of the opposite type,” Katalin Novák, Hungary’s minister of state for family, youth and international affairs, said at a conference on demography last year organised by the Hungarian government.The conference in Budapest opened with a sand animation video of migrants rushing towards Europe, and was laced with references to the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which suggests that shadowy forces want to replace so-called “native” Europeans with outsiders. “There are political forces in Europe who want a replacement of population for ideological or other reasons,” Orbán told the conference.Ágoston Mráz, who heads a pro-government thinktank in Budapest, said the pro-children policy was a response to a longstanding conservative fear of national extinction, as well as an ideological statement. “It’s anti-liberal, it’s a sign that we are not a multi-coloured country, we believe that while everyone is free to do what they want, there is a hierarchy, and a family made up of a husband and a wife is at the top,” he said.This focus on “traditional families” has become a cornerstone of the Orbán government. Rightwingers from across the world have travelled to Hungary to discuss and praise the country’s family policy. “Hungarian family policy is worthy of close study,” Tim Montgomerie, a former adviser to Boris Johnson, wrote on Twitter in December.The social conservatism underlying such policies is evidenced by the fact that much of the support is available only to married couples. Non-married heterosexual couples and single women are also eligible for free IVF treatment, but not lesbians, meaning one half of a lesbian couple must pretend to be single and heterosexual if they wish to qualify.In Poland, too, government messaging gives a populist twist to the 500+ policy. “In Germany, billions of euros are spent on support for immigrants, but here these billions of złotys are spent on Polish families,” said the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. “This is a revolutionary socio-demographic project, and we are proud of it.”Yet despite all the investment, the jury is still out on whether these policies work. In Hungary, the fertility rate has risen from 1.23 to 1.48, though it is hard to gauge how much of that is down to specific policies. In Poland, a brief spike in births after the introduction of the 500+ policy was not sustained. “You don’t expect a breakthrough in two or three years, it’s going to take at least 10,” said Zoltán Kovács, Orbán’s spokesman.The formula for raising birthrates is a slippery thing, with shelves of academic literature and statistical case studies devoted to the debate. Studies show that poorer families tend to have more children than richer families in any case, meaning that boosting birthrates is about more than financial security.“We regret we don’t have good birth rate, but that only comes if we improve our economic life,” Zoran Zaev, North Macedonia’s prime minister until earlier this year, told the  in a recent interview. His social democratic government cut family support policies for larger families that had been introduced by the previous rightwing nationalist government.“There are good birthrates in countries where there is good social care and well-developed economies. These policies change nothing, it just means we spent a lot of money and told our citizens not to work and wait for money,” he added.Anne Gauthier, a professor of comparative family studies at the University of Groningen, said boosting fertility with government spending “can work under very specific circumstances”. She said the key was continuity of policies over many years, giving people the confidence that the support measures are here to stay. She pointed to France, which despite a recent drop still has one of the highest fertility rates in the EU, as a country that has had a generous and sustainable model.Gauthier praised the Hungarian model for offering a package of different measures rather than simply handing out cash. But it’s very difficult to isolate specific reasons for changes in fertility, and researchers still don’t know what effect particular family policies have on the birthrates.“In Scandinavia we thought they got it right, there was a very comprehensive package, focused on gender equality, that ticks all the boxes, and in the past year fertility is going down. So we are scratching our heads and trying to work out what’s going on,” she said.There is a question of whether more targeted spending would be a better use of government resources. The Polish 500+ policy is not means-tested, nor are most of the Hungarian benefits. Indeed, some of the bigger loans actually benefit wealthier families, as they require proof of employment and minimum income levels.The other problem with these policies is that a focus on numbers, with bonuses for each birth, can put statistics ahead of emotions. The upfront payments in the Hungarian system are of particular concern, putting pressure on women to have children they may no longer want. Couples who take out the loan and then get orced have to pay back the whole amount within 120 days. Couples who find out they are infertile are also obliged to repay.“It increases dependencies, and if you’re in a bad or abusive relationship you are even less free to leave it if you’re bound together by these loans,” said Dorottya Szikra, of the Centre for Social Sciences in Budapest.Daniel Szalay, from Budapest, recounted how he and his wife had applied for the “baby-expecting” loan last July, when she was already more than seven months pregnant. She then had a miscarriage. The bank told the couple that as there was no child, they would not get the benefits, even though the law stipulates they should. “It’s so frustrating. After this trauma we suffered, the last thing we expected is to have to go through a never-ending process to prove something with which we have already complied,” he said.For governments who claim national survival is at stake, these inidual traumas are a small price to pay for a potential boost in the birthrate. Funding fertility programmes allows populist governments to tick many boxes: to show they are taking care of families financially, reinforce their focus on “traditional values” and accentuate fears of replacement by migration from abroad if the “native” population continues to shrink.“A good state is where the people are not scared of the future and where the population is rising not due to migration from foreign countries,” said the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, speaking at Orbán’s migration conference. “I don’t wish to scare anyone but we must discuss the issue that we are facing extinction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b36abb7f3927ca4f50a4ce0b64f6e705862ea08/0_132_5249_3149/master/5249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=173bb02a6c39b9c16f92181d887abb7b","title":"climate action the latest target of europes fossil fuel lobbyists","story":"Fossil fuel firms are making good use of the many revolving doors available to them in BrusselsPicture the scene: a dinner for MEPs organised by leading fossil fuel firms to explain the lengths to which their industries have gone to combat climate emergency. On the guest list, the environment minister of Croatia, current holders of the EU’s rotating presidency, and Guido Bortoni, an adviser in the European commission’s energy directorate. Nobody at all from civil society or the NGO sector. In other words a perfect Brussels lobbying event.Billed as “Oil and Gas and the Green Deal” this dinner took place on 17 February, just a fortnight before the unveiling of the EU’s first ever climate law. The meal was sponsored by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP), which represents 29 of Europe’s main fossil fuel operators, including Total, Shell, BP and ExxonMobil.According to the EU transparency register the IOGP spent €350,160 in 2018 lobbying in Brussels, so it can afford to take a few MEPs out to dinner. The European Energy Forum (EEF) is the perfect organiser: it is headed by Jerzy Buzek, an MEP for the European People’s party (EPP), a former prime minister of Poland, a former president of the European parliament and currently chair of its industry research and energy committee. The forum boasts 82 associate members, firms that pay “at least” €7,000 a year in membership fees. Predictably they are all in the oil and gas sector.The EEF politely turned down a media request to attend an earlier gathering on 26 November entitled “Gas: Driving the Energy Transition”. “We do not accept journalists at our events,” was the response. The event was sponsored by Eurogas, the gas industry’s main lobbying organisation, and two German firms, Uniper and Wintershall. An official from the European commissions DG Energy also attended.The European Green Deal, the commission’s €1tn plan to prepare the European economy for confronting the climate crisis, has prompted a round of intensive lobbying activity. “Since 2010, the five main oil and gas corporations and their fossil fuel lobby groups have spent at least a quarter of a billion euros buying influence at the heart of European decision-making,” claims a report produced by a coalition of climate NGOs (Corporate Europe Observatory, Food \u0026amp Water Europe, Friends of the Earth Europe and Greenpeace).Such firms, their business founded on extracting fossil fuels, have an interest in delaying or undermining policies designed to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. They make much use of Brussels-based thinktanks such as the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS). A week before the newly sworn-in commission presented its climate policies, CEPS hosted on 4 December, a “by invitation-only” event on the Green Deal funded by Equinor and Fortum, the energy market leaders in Norway and Finland, respectively. Firms are welcome to join CEPS as corporate members. ExxonMobil, for example, pays €15,000 a year for this access. The thinktank has organised members-only breakfast meetings with guests such as Frans Timmermans, now EU commissioner in charge of the Green Deal. Members of commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s team have been the focus of relentless attention from energy industry and particularly gas lobbyists for months. In the last 10 days of January alone, Eurogas representatives met six commissioners and officials from departments for the environment, trade, budget, agriculture and economic affairs. Each time the declared business of the meeting was the Green Deal.The energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, will be the keynote speaker at this year’s Eurogas conference on 19 March in Brussels. Six members of the association’s staff are accredited for access to EU parliament buildings. Eurogas spent €800,000 on lobbying in 2018 alone. “DG Energy is very permeable to the gas lobby,” says Pascal Canfin, a Renew Europe MEP and chair of the parliament’s environment committee.The IOGP has been busy too. On 17 December it met Ditte Juul Jorgensen, the head of DG Energy, then in January two other European commission members, in different directorates. The topic was of course the Green Deal.Similarly employers’ group Business Europe has shown great interest in the commission’s new plans for the environment. Speakers at the federation’s annual gathering on 4 March – the day the EU’s new climate law is being unveiled – include Von der Leyen in person, two of her vice-presidents and three commissioners.Another means of influencing European policymakers is to use lobbying firms. FTI Consulting is one of the most effective. Transparency International ranked it second for setting up meetings with the EU executive in 2018.With 38 staff members accredited for access to the European parliament FTI billed Eurogas, then a new customer, between €25,000 and €50,000 in 2018. Earnings from ExxonMobil, its second largest account totalled €600,000 to €700,000. The same year it carried out confidential research for Gas Infrastructure Europe. Measures for a Sustainable Gas Storage Market, the resulting study, was subsequently posted and is still on the European commission’s website. The firm has made good use of the many revolving doors available in Brussels. In 2016-18, for instance, Philip Lowe, after heading DG Energy (2010-14), was a senior adviser to FTI on public affairs.Jean-Arnold Vinois is another example of the revolving doors in operation. He is an energy policy adviser at the Jacques Delors Institute, a well known thinktank, but also an honorary director for energy at the commission and a consultant at FleishmanHillard, another big lobbying outfit in Brussels. This firm counts the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) – earning it almost €1m in 2018 – the gas lobby Gas Naturally (€25,000 to €50,000) and Fuels Europe, another oil and gas federation, among its customers.Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the gas industry’s latest hobby-horse, seen as a means of justifying its fossil fuel activities. The snag is that CCS technology is far from being ready for widespread use and even if research succeeds in perfecting the techniques, a drastic reduction in emissions will still be needed over the next 20 years. The gas industry nevertheless persists in promoting it as a solution. Eurogas is working hand-in-hand with the Global CCS Institute, the key lobby in this field. On 18 February, in partnership with the United Kingdom Mission to the EU, it held a conference on the topic in Brussels. It is particularly difficult to pin down the role of EU governments in advancing the interests of their firms. There is no equivalent to the EU transparency register to keep track of the national governments or their missions.Industry is by no means alone in attempting to influence EU lawmakers on climate issues. Powerful environmental thinktanks and NGOs – such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Transport \u0026amp Environment, the Climate Action Network or the European Climate Foundation (ECF) – are hard at work too. Their financial means are substantial but less than their opponents. In 2018 the ECF reported expenditure of between €500,000 and €600,000, while WWF spent €2.2m to €2.4m over the same period.Aude Massiot writes for Liberation on environment issues.

It was not thought to be coronavirus but managers asked staff to work remotely for test the company’s ability to function with a ghost headquarters. It is unclear when employees will return.Other companies have decided to do so indefinitely, emulating a trend that started in Asia after coronavirus erupted in China in December.Twitter is urging its 5,000 global staff to work from home. “Beginning today, we are strongly encouraging all employees globally to work from home if they’re able,” a company blogpost said on Monday. “Our goal is to lower the probability of the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus for us – and the world around us.”Brian Armstrong, the CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase, made a similar announcement. “We’re asking some employees to start working home this week,” he tweeted. “Working from home is not a complete solution but it may help slow the growth of infections.”There has been deepening alarm at the spread of the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the world had entered uncharted territory as new infections dropped in China but surged elsewhere. With stock markets reeling and growth forecasts slashed, companies have been ramping up efforts to keep workers infection-free. Many have restricted or banned non-essential business travel, cancelled public events and withdrawn from conferences.On Tuesday night health officials in Ireland confirmed a second case, a female in the east of the country. They said it was unrelated to the schoolboy diagnosed in Dublin last weekend after he returned from Italy. Google is bracing for a potentially rapid spread that could imperil its operations at Silicon Docks.“We continue to take precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of our workforce, in accordance with the advice of medical experts, and as part of that effort we have asked our Dublin teams to work from home,” Google said in a statement.Keeping a business functional while the workforce is scattered presents multiple challenges. Workers and managers need to adopt new practices, rely on cloud-based applications and other technologies and try to avoid distractions – children, pets, domestic chores, a clandestine siesta.Google’s decision prompted envy among some tech workers who did work in Silicon Docks on Tuesday. A WhatsApp group of Facebook staffers and contractors expressed hope that their own employers would follow suit – to protect their health and spare them commuting.Twitter, which is based in San Francisco and employs people across the world, said it would tailor practices to remote working but would keep offices open for employees who preferred to or needed to work at company premises, with the exception of Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea, where working from home was mandatory.“While this is a big change for us, we have already been moving towards a more distributed workforce that’s increasingly remote, said Jennifer Christie, its head of human resources. “We’re a global service and we’re committed to enabling anyone, anywhere to work at Twitter.”Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, recently said he planned to move to Africa for up to six months this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8af99e61af63e4c4199e0cb9f79cda50fdd60e12/0_81_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cef44caa562d42750ebd6c90c631c48c","title":"coronavirus japan to cancel fukushima anniversary ceremony reports","story":"Efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 set to put paid to tribute marking March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and meltdown disaster, says NHKJapan is to cancel a ceremony to mark the anniversary next week of the March 2011  triple disaster on its north-east coast, as part of government-led efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus.The national ceremony was due to be held in Tokyo on 11 March, exactly nine years after a powerful earthquake and tsunami killed more than 18,000 people and triggered a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.The government had considered scaling down the ceremony or asking participants to take precautions against the virus, but is making plans to cancel it, according to public broadcaster NHK.Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, last week recommended the cancellation of large-scale sports and cultural events after the government drew criticism for its handling of the outbreak.Japan recorded its 1,000th Covid-19 infection on Wednesday, in the western prefecture of Yamaguchi.

Visitors will also be able to arrange private hanami gatherings in Ueno park, but there will be no mobile food trucks or rubbish bins provided.Many of the most popular attractions in Tokyo have announced closures until at least the middle of the month.The long list of leisure and cultural attractions to have temporarily closed their doors include Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea, the Ghibli Museum, Tokyo Skytree and the Kabukiza theatre.A travelling exhibition of 60 paintings – including Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers –from the National Gallery in London has been postponed until at least 17 March after its Japanese host, the National Museum of Western Art, said it would close. The exhibition is due to move to Osaka in early July.The Robot Restaurant in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district – a popular destination for overseas tourists – will not reopen until 9 March, while the Toyosu fish market, known for its dawn tuna auctions, will be off-limits to visitors until the middle of the month.The outbreak has also hit the capital’s culinary scene, with the conveyer-belt sushi chain Hamazushi saying that diners will now have to order dishes via a touch-screen panel rather than selecting plates as they pass in front of them, NHK said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakThe global death toll is 3,190 while more than 93,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries.

She said: “Jesus was always determined to make those who society sees as outsiders be insiders.”She said the church was slowly changing but she wanted to challenge “those in high places: look at what you’re doing.”Glasspool, the first married lesbian bishop in the global Anglican church, said the inclusive service would carry an important message. “The LGBT+ community in the UK and other places might not understand that they are invited to celebrate at the Christian table. We need to make it known that everyone is included – all are invited to this particular celebration.”She said Justin Welby, Williams’ successor as archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the Anglican church, had “gone out of his way to uninvite inidual persons in a breach of hospitality”.Bishops’ spouses have traditionally been guests at the Lambeth conference, but it was deemed “inappropriate” to invite same-sex spouses to this year’s event. Glasspool received a letter from Welby in December 2018 informing her of his decision “not to invite your spouse to the Lambeth conference, a decision that I am well aware will cause you pain, which I regret deeply.”The letter came as a shock, Glasspool said. “It was unnecessary, it was creating an issue where one didn’t exist.” She suspects the move was intended to “appease” conservative Anglicans in the US.The primates of Nigeria, Rwanda and Uganda, who are known to have staunchly conservative views on sexuality, have said they will not attend the Lambeth conference. So far 673 bishops and 521 spouses have registered.The poll highlighted a generational difference, with more than two-thirds of Anglicans under the age of 50 backing same-sex marriage. Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, said the results “provide a challenge to us in leadership within the Church of England to ensure that we understand the views of the people we serve”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7b41325eec83e6cf96aa3fd92c73d11b7c2e417/7_0_1982_1190/master/1982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75b9545ee2099b1c80a5890b58d9a21f","title":"the best thing about wellington mittens the cat has paws all over new zealand capital","story":"Turkish Angora roams tattoo parlours, office towers and churches, posing for social media snapshots along the wayA feline that roams New Zealand’s capital city and is welcomed into tattoo parlours, hairdressers and office towers has become a social media star, with 30,000 followers who track his every movement online.Mittens first came to attention in 2018 after repeatedly wandering inner-city dwellings, including the university, the post office, and a Catholic church.

Owner Silvio Bruinsma says Mittens had similar venturesome habits when they lived together in Auckland but Wellington’s compact inner city has now made him much easier to track.Mittens’ brother Latte, also a Turkish angora, does not share the intrepid streak and rarely ventures more than 20m from home, while Mittens can roam up to 2km.“He has made Wellington his playground,” Bruinsma told the Dominion Post.“I suppose my philosophy is, he doesn’t like being locked up and I don’t want to give him a life that is miserable.”Although there was some initial concern for Mittens’ apparently aimless wanderings (no one feeds him but Bruinsma), locals and visitors now actively go looking for the cat and say he shows caution around roads – reportedly even stopping to wait at traffic lights.In one close encounter, detailed in February on the Facebook page, Mittens got stuck in a $2 shop after falling asleep. A combined effort by Facebook members led to him being tracked to his last known location and the owners of the store were contacted to let him out after hours.Sam Thacker, one of the administrators of the Facebook group and a staff member at the SPCA, has known Mittens for years and describes him as “street smart”.“Please don’t pick him up and bring him into the SPCA,” Thacker posted.“He has come in too many times with well meaning people. All this means is that his owner has to come and collect him off us! We have had him in with us recently and he is perfectly healthy.”According to pictures posted online in the last week, Mittens has visited a real estate agent, a Latino salsa bar, a community law centre and Victoria university."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/566a212f675cf1fc6469f565e3dde11a78ab6f3e/0_0_4188_2514/master/4188.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc700e774363e8afab7ab10e9699419a","title":"wednesday briefing a super tuesday for joe biden","story":"Bernie Sanders not out of the running … NHS ‘leavers and retirees’ shun coronavirus call-up plan … and readers on their favourite treesHello, Warren Murray with you on the Wednesday morning after Super Tuesday.Feverish reporting continues of the results from 14 US states that are voting for their choice of Democratic candidate to face Donald Trump in the presidential election.

The trade union federation marked Wednesday as the first day of the year that the average woman effectively begins to get paid.“Our economy is stacked against working women. At this rate, it will take another 50 years to close the gender pay gap,” said the TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady. “No more excuses: the government must get on and sort the gender pay gap now.”In professional, scientific and technical jobs, the average woman waits 88 days with her women’s pay day coming on 28 March 2020.The widest gender pay gap is in finance and insurance. Female employees wait for more than a third of the year before pay kicks in on 3 May 2020.The analysis also showed significant regional gender pay differences, linked to the concentration of industries in different regions.Companies with more than 250 employees have been forced to publish their gender pay gap since changes to the Equality Act came into force on 6 April 2017. Previous filings have revealed that almost eight out of 10 British companies pay men more than women.Critics have also warned that inaccurate figures and a lack of sanctions risk making a mockery of the gender pay gap reporting system.  analysis of submissions revealed that mathematically impossible gender pay gap data filed by companies in 2018 had remained uncorrected while the Equality and Human Rights Commission admitted that no companies had been fined for failing to comply with legislation.The TUC has argued that the government should force companies to carry out equal pay audits, produce action plans to close the pay gap in their workplace, and fine companies that fail to comply with the law instantly.“Just publishing gender pay gaps isn’t enough. Companies must be required to explain what steps they’ll take to close their gender pay gaps – and bosses who don’t comply with the law should be fined,” said O’Grady.She said employers should do more to help women balance family responsibilities and work and called for flexible working to be a right for everyone at work from day one.Ahead of the TUC’s annual women’s conference in London, which begins today, she added: “Every year unions help thousands of women get the pay they deserve. And workplaces that recognise unions are more likely to have family-friendly policies and fair pay. That’s why every woman should be in a union.”A Government Equalities Office spokesperson said: “We want to see everyone given the same opportunities at work. This means we want to see employers encouraging shared parental leave, flexible working and other measures which put people in the best place to succeed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eae899b66ca5a4544c8c7fc3549f159248d9f84f/0_360_5906_3544/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=068ca47cd0d0d67fa4362bb8920cc554","title":"everest by sohei nishino","story":"Photo-collage by Japanese artist is made from hundreds of prints from foothills to summit"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsA second case of the coronavirus has been confirmed in the east of Ireland.The case is a female whose infection is unrelated to the first case which was confirmed last Sunday involving a school student from Dublin.The latest case is associated with travel from Italy and the patient is receiving appropriate care, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) said.The positive test result emerged on Tuesday evening, after the NPHET held a five-hour meeting to review measures, and efforts to trace contacts of the woman have just begun.Members of the team briefed media on the latest case on Tuesday evening.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan described the case as “not unexpected” but said Ireland remained in a containment phase and had yet to experience local transmission, as was the case in other EU states.All non-essential travel to four regions in Italy - Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont - is now being advised against.The Department of Foreign Affairs’ previous advice against non-essential travel in Italy was previously limited to 11 specific towns in the region.Guidance on mass gatherings is to be publishing in the coming days, following cross-Government review, Dr Holohan said.But he added that “as things stand”, he saw no reason why the St Patrick’s Day Festival could not go ahead later this month.The testing of suspected cases is also to be moved from hospitals to the community, most likely people’s homes.Dr Holohan said this would take further pressure off hospitals and that the tests would be carried out by paramedics.Issues relating to vulnerable people, healthcare workers, medicines supply and the preparedness of hospitals are to be examined by four separate sub-committees, the NPHET also announced.The measure being taken to counter the spread of the virus do have wider societal implications, he acknowledged, and these would be addressed by the Cabinet committee that has been established.A total of 397 people have been tested for the virus since the current outbreak started in January, public health officials said on Tuesday, compared to 90 this time last week. The female who travelled to northern Italy and the Dublin school student are the only two tests to come back positive.The increase in tests is mainly due to a widening of the number of areas of the world subject to coronavirus-related travel advice.Previously, the Department of Foreign Affairs’s travel advice was confined to travellers from China, but it now encompasses other areas, including Japan, Hong Kong, Iran, and the four regions in Italy where restrictions have been imposed.Anyone coming back from these areas and who feels unwell is being advised to contact their GP and may require testing. Italy, the European country worst affected by coronavirus, has exported cases to many other countries, including Ireland.Earlier, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “The situation is still evolving... but there is a moderate to high risk of more cases.”He said: “What we’re pursuing in Ireland at the moment is a policy of containment, making sure that any cases that are identified are contact-traced and we contain any potential outbreak.“But we may come to stage in a few weeks time if that’s not successful where we move to mitigation phase, and that would be treating the ill, rather than trying to contain the virus but we’re not at that stage yet.”Regarding the impact on St Patrick’s Day parades and other events, the Taoiseach said “we’re not advising anyone to cancel any gatherings at this stage.“But bear in mind that the St Patrick’s Day festival is two weeks away and a lot can happen between now and then.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4191957.1583267922!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu and uk could agree device to extend talks says ex official","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDavid O’Sullivan’s last official posting was as EU ambassador to the US from 2014-2019. File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe EU and UK could agree a “device” to extend the transition period if talks fail to secure a trade deal by the July 1st deadline, a former European Commission secretary-general has said.David O’Sullivan, an Irish former EU director-general in charge of trade who brokered the bloc’s trade with South Korea, said the UK government could drop its objection to the extension of the transition period from the end of the year if it could be sold politically at home. This could then “buy” both sides “more time to continue the discussions” to resolve issues where agreement has not agreed and avoid another potential “cliff-edge” no-deal scenario on December 31st, Mr O’Sullivan told The .British prime minister Boris Johnson has threatened to walk away from Brexit trade talks if negotiations have failed to make progress by June and to focus instead on preparations for the UK’s hard exit from EU economic rules on World Trade Organization terms at the end of the year. Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, both the EU and UK must agree to extend the transition period by July 1st, though the UK government has legislated to prevent this scenario happening.Mr O’Sullivan said that he did not think it possible to agree a comprehensive free trade agreement in the nine-month period available and said that an extension of the transition period could be agreed, “which would not be called an extension”.“As a former negotiator I could imagine such a device being possible if both sides felt it worked for them,” he said.“Obviously it would require the UK to feel they could sell this as not being an extension of the transition phase, but I could imagine that it would have benefits for both sides potentially if it is not possible to solve everything or even to solve most things by the end of the year.”The retired Irish civil servant said he was most worried the EU-UK trade talks, which began on Monday, were not starting from “a position of mutual trust and confidence” in the wake of reports saying that the UK were trying to “get around” the ratified Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. “It is very unhelpful. As Irish people, of course we feel particularly aggrieved by that kind of language,” he said.“Stepping back from the emotions of our nationality, I think the rest of the EU will look at this and say, ‘but wait a minute we have a legal document, legally binding by both sides, ratified and suddenly we are told one side is actively considering how to wriggle out of it.’”‘Unprecedented’Mr O’Sullivan, whose last official posting was as EU ambassador to the US from 2014-2019, described the EU-UK trade talks as “unprecedented” in that the two sides were moving from a position of total free trade to less free trade.The negotiations were “sort of free trade in reverse” as the discussions were uniquely aimed at finding agreement on the degree of ergence rather than convergence, said Mr O’Sullivan. “Typically, in a situation of free trade negotiations, you are talking about two parties who are relatively far apart or have distance between them and you are trying to narrow that distance and you are trying to converge,” he said. “Here we have perfect convergence which we are trying to turn into imperfect ergence.” Mr O’Sullivan will be speaking at an event hosted by the Institute of International and European Affairs in Dublin and Trinity College’s “Hist” debating society on Wednesday alongside former commission president Romano Prodi, and former European Council president and Belgian prime minister Herman Van Rompuy.

Photograph: Frederic J. BrownAFP via Getty Images.Former vice president Joe Biden swept to victory in a string of US states overnight, capping an extraordinary 36 hours which saw the once-faltering candidate surge on Super Tuesday.Mr Biden notched-up a series of decisive wins in states across the country, and was positioned to possibly win the highest number of delegates of all candidates, as Americans in more than a dozen states went to the polls to select the Democratic candidate to take on Donald Trump in November.While final results were yet to be reported in California and Texas - the states with the highest number of delegates - Mr Biden was possibly positioned to beat Mr Sanders in terms of the number of delegates amassed.As well as winning southern states like Alabama and Tennessee, he also secured surprise wins in northeastern states like Massachusetts.Signs that a Biden surge was in the offing were evident within minutes of the polls closing. The former vice president clocked up early victories in Virginia, North Carolina and Alabama, replicating his game-changing performance in South Carolina on Saturday when he surged to victory on the back of strong African-American support.Though the race was more competitive in states like Tennessee and Arkansas, a broad swathe of southern states were soon called for Mr Biden.Mr Sanders won his home state of Vermont, as well as Colorado and Utah, while he was expected to win California, with exit polls showing that more than half of Latino voters had endorsed him.TrailingIn a measure of swing to Mr Biden, the former vice president won Minnesota and Massachusetts, where he had been trailing in the polls. Though Mr Biden evidently benefitted from Minnesota-native Amy Klobuchar’s decision to drop out and endorse him, Mr Sanders had been widely expected to clinch the state, given his strong polling in the Minneapolis area and beyond.Similarly, Mr Biden had not been expected to win Massachusetts where Mr Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - the state’s senator - had been leading in polls.Tuesday’s results raised question marks about the future of the campaigns of billionaire Michael Bloomberg and Ms Warren.This was Mr Bloomberg’s first electoral test of the campaign after he chose to sit out the four early-voting states and instead concentrate his resources on Super Tuesday and beyond.But despite spending more than $500 million on advertising, Mr Bloomberg’s only victory was in the Pacific island of American Samoa, where he secured 175 votes, generating four delegates.Addressing supporters at a campaign event in Miami, Mr Bloomberg said he would not step down, but the Associated Press later reported that he was considering making an announcement about the future of his campaign on Wednesday.Similarly, Ms Warren struggled to reach the 15 per cent threshold needed to secure delegates. In a major blow to her campaign, she finished third in her home state of Massachusetts.DefiantMr Sanders, who still appeared to be on course for a victory in California, struck a hopeful and defiant tone as he addressed supporters in Vermont on Tuesday.“Tonight I tell you with absolute confidence we’re going to win the Democratic nomination,” he said.He also made some coded references to Mr Biden, noting that he himself had not voted to endorse the war in Iraq or in favour of trade deals that hurt parts of working class America.“Let’s go on to the White House,” he said as he concluded his speech.In a speech in Las Vegas, Mr Biden thanked his supporters and welcomed their “bold, progressive vision”.He quoted Seamus Heaney’s The Cure at Troy, saying “History says, don’t hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up and make hope and history rhyme.”Fourteen states, as well as American Samoa and Democrats Abroad, held their primaries on Tuesday - the most important day so far in the Democratic primary calendar.A third of all delegates will be decided when the results of Tuesday’s contests are confirmed, with a clutch of important states still to vote on March 10th and March 17th.The Democratic nominee to take on Mr Trump in November will be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee in July.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"carrie gracie nearing end road bbc","story":"The BBC will “rightly die” unless it gets its pay issues under control, Carrie Gracie has said, as she suggested that her own career with the corporation is coming to an end.Gracie fought and won a high-profile battle with the BBC for equal pay after discovering that she was significantly underpaid as China editor in comparison to the US editor, Jon Sopel.The BBC apologised to Gracie and gave her £361,000 in back pay, which she donated to the Fawcett Society. But equal pay problems persist, with Samira Ahmed winning a substantial payout last month.The broadcaster is also under pressure to cut the salaries of its highest-paid presenters and managers.“I’m not stupid and I’m not militant and I’m not mad. I’m impatient. I want the BBC to live up to its values,” Gracie told an audience at the Media Society.The broadcaster recently announced it was cutting 450 jobs in its news ision, and Gracie said overpaid managers should be first in the firing line.Referring to the BBC series W1A, a spoof of the corporation’s management culture, she added: “The meetings you see in W1A - the truth is weirder than the fiction.

The Prime Minister described the virus as a national challenge ... something that our country has to get through. The document detailed plans to help businesses threatened by the growing crisis and said that the Army was on standby to get involved in the crisis. The plan drew comparisons between coronavirus and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic and revealed that the Government was working on a worst-case scenario of 500,000 deaths, with up to 80 per cent of the country becoming infected.The 28-page action plan stated that any major outbreak could be just the first of multiple waves to hit the country. The Prime Minister said the Government was committed to doing everything possible in order to limit the damage the virus could wreak on Britain, warning that it was now highly likely that it would continue to spread.The Government’s advisers said that if the outbreak became impossible to contain, they would expect it to take six to eight weeks to reach its peak.The worst pressures would likely be seen in April or May, while the fallout from an outbreak or pandemic could continue until August.The Government plan was based on estimates that the virus could infect up to 80 per cent of people, in a worst-case scenario. It suggested that at the peak of a crisis, this could mean one in five workers are off sick at the same time.Officials said they anticipated overall death rates of around 1 per cent, compared with death rates of around 0.026 per cent seen during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.But they were fearful of far higher death rates among the elderly, with research showing coronavirus has mortality rates of almost 15 per cent among those over the age of 80.The plan set out sweeping measures - including the use of police to maintain public order, and only fulfilling critical functions - that may be taken if a major outbreak or pandemic occurs.With a significant loss of officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order, said the document. It said the Army could be used to take over duties at protected locations such as nuclear sites, Parliament and Downing Street if police forces became understaffed due to illness.The Armed Forces were on standby to help fill gaps in vital public services if the pressures on them became significant and clearly noticeable.Meanwhile, border forces would be given police-style powers to detain people at borders if they were showing symptoms of the virus and refused to be tested.The action plan also pledged to ensure dignified treatment of all affected, including those who die. The document said the Government was ready to combat a severe prolonged pandemic as experienced in 1918 when Spanish flu killed up to 50 million people worldwide.Advisers said the profile of coronavirus was very different: far less severe for children and young people, but most deadly in the elderly. Care homes were advised to go into lockdown in the event of a major coronavirus outbreak, with visitors banned and sick patients confined to their bedrooms rather than being taken automatically to hospital.The guidance seen by The  came as health chiefs urged relatives not to go and visit your auntie in a care home” if they were suffering from a cold or flu-like symptoms. The plan spelled out the four phases - contain, delay, research and mitigate - behind the Government strategy.During the delay phase, which would be triggered when it became clear that it was no longer possible to contain the spread of the virus, actions could include school closures, encouraging greater home working, and reducing the number of large-scale gatherings.Yesterday, ministers repeatedly stressed that this stage had not yet been reached. Advisers warned that taking these steps at the wrong time risked creating an awful lot of disruption and could mean that people were unlikely to heed such advice when it became critical.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said sick leave rules could be changed to allow people to sign themselves off work for two weeks in order to self-isolate. Mr Hancock told MPs the issue was under review, given that the current situation means a person must give their employer a doctor\u0027s note if they have been ill for more than seven days.Meanwhile, health chiefs in the Canary Islands confirmed the sixth person to test positive at the Tenerife hotel hit by coronavirus was a British woman who had been mixing with other guests for more than a week.A spokeswoman for the regional health authority admitted the unnamed Briton had not been confined to her room for most of her week-long stay at the four-star H10 Costa Adeje Palace.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"governments coronavirus action plan detail","story":"Boris Johnson set out his battle plan for tackling the coronavirus yesterday, promising that the Government will take all necessary and reasonable steps to beat it.The Prime Minister said he had no doubt at all that the UK is going to get through coronavirus and get through it in good shape.The 28-page coronavirus action plan outlines what the Government will do as and when it moves from the current strategy of containing the virus to the next stage: delaying its worst effects and then mitigating the problems when it peaks.Government health advisers suggested it is likely to take six months for the virus to run its course once it becomes impossible to contain, meaning it will be mid-August at the earliest before the outbreak is over.There is also the possibility of multiple waves of the virus if people are not immune to catching it more than once.The delay phase will kick in once health experts have advised that it is no longer possible to prevent widespread infections simply by isolating those known to have caught it.In the battle plan, and during a press conference yesterday, the Prime Minister and his senior health advisers set out how the NHS, police and other sectors would cope in the worst-case scenario, as outlined below.Soldiers will take over guard duties at protected locations such as nuclear sites, Parliament and Downing Street from the police officers who normally patrol them. Border Force officers will also be given police-style powers to detain people at borders if they are showing symptoms of the virus and refuse to be tested.And in the worst-case scenario, where workplaces could have up to a fifth of their staff off sick, understaffed police forces will be able to investigate only the most serious crimes.The Government’s coronavirus action plan also promised to ensure dignity for anyone who dies from contracting the virus, but it shied away from discussing the specifics for disposing of what could ultimately be hundreds of thousands of deaths in a worst-case scenario.Referring to staff shortages among police officers, the document said police and fire services will concentrate on fulfilling critical functions, adding: For example, with a significant loss of officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order.It also stated that the Ministry of Defence will provide support to civil authorities if requested.Government sources insisted that the Armed Forces would only take over guard duties at the most sensitive of sites. Unless you live near those sites, you wouldn’t be seeing the Army out on the streets, said one source.However, it is unclear whether soldiers could also be asked to take over patrol duties at mainline railway stations and other places usually covered by the police.NHS hospitals will be told to postpone anything postponable in the event of a major outbreak of coronavirus, England\u0027s Chief Medical Officer has warned.Routine operations would be cancelled, other treatments rationed and patients sent home from hospital early in a bid to free up beds for high-priority cases, according to the Government\u0027s coronavirus action plan. Health chiefs have declared the highest state of NHS emergency, ramping up efforts to cope with the crisis. All intensive care units have been ordered to carry out urgent checks on their patients amid concerns some could already be infected with the virus and at risk of spreading it among the most vulnerable.  A letter to NHS trust chief executives, seen by The , said that if the outbreak were to spread, all wards could be used to treat sufferers. The letter, from Professor Keith Willett, NHS Strategic Incident Director, stated: “It is essential that we detect cases admitted to intensive care at the earliest opportunity.” Until now, every patient with suspected coronavirus has been tested and treated in isolation. But, the letter warned, if the outbreak continued, every acute unit in the hospital would have be prepared to take such cases and make efforts to keep them away from other patients. The Government\u0027s coronavirus action plan said that if that were to occur, it would move to the mitigation phase of its strategy, which could mean significant and clearly noticeable pressures on services. Officials suggested this could mean routine NHS services being stopped for several weeks around the peak of an outbreak, which could start in six to eight weeks. Government sources said it could mean more than 50,000 operations being put on hold. Professor Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said that the NHS will be prepared to slow down or postpone anything that is postponable if it is facing a major surge in demand. The coronavirus action plan said: As NHS staff start to become affected, and more seriously ill patients require admission, clinicians may recommend a significantly different approach to admissions. Some non-urgent care may be delayed to prioritise and triage service delivery.It also stated that more will be done to support early discharge from hospital to free up as many beds as possible.Meanwhile, Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales, said the UK was expecting a significant increase in cases next month.The best guess is then a period of six to eight weeks of quite significant levels of transmission in the UK, with a tapering perhaps in July and August - so an upsurge in April, possible peak in MayJune and a downturn later in the year, he said.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said ministers were considering turning to private hospitals for extra bed capacity in the event of a major outbreak. He said it would be all hands to the pump in the NHS, with retired doctors and nurses, and volunteers, brought in to support healthcare services.While the action plan suggested around a fifth of workers across the UK could fall sick at any one time, the fear among officials was that the figure in the NHS could be far higher, given staff members\u0027 likely exposure to the virus. The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said the public could play its part by thinking about what we can to do to avoid too much pressure on the NHS when it comes to using services such as GPs and 111. He said: It will be quite important to be self-restraining where possible.  Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government\u0027s chief scientific adviser, said the crisis in the UK could last as long as six months, from the point that sustained person-to-person transmission is confirmed. So far the UK has seen 51 cases. Sir Patrick said: “You can think of it as roughly two to three months from an outbreak of sustained person-to-person transmission up to the peak - and two to three months after the peak to decline again is the timeline we would be thinking of.” But Prof Whitty suggested the biggest changes to the running of the NHS - such as  postponing operations - would likely last a number of weeks rather than months. More than six million people could end up off work when the coronavirus peaks, the Government has warned, in a major blow to businesses and the wider economy.The worst case scenario would take one-fifth of all employees out of the workforce, leaving a gaping hole in Britain\u0027s output as crucial workers are stuck at home or in hospital.Companies have been offered limited help to delay big tax bills, while workers may end up relying on the benefits system – particularly if they are self-employed.Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, has said the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) would be on hand to support companies to make sure they get through the short-term difficulties and make sure they have the protections they need. He added: We are taking each step as it comes.However, the help on offer to businesses facing slumping sales or a shortage of workers is limited, according to the coronavirus action plan.For businesses facing short-term cash flow issues (for example, as the result of subdued demand), an effective mitigation already exists in HMRC\u0027s Time To Pay system. This is offered on a case-by-case basis if a firm or inidual contacts HMRC about falling behind on their tax, the document says.This scheme lets companies pay the previous year\u0027s tax bill in instalments over time rather than in one go.Children\u0027s exams face being thrown into chaos if the coronavirus outbreak forces the Government to close schools.There are fears that any closures could coincide with the start of the GCSE and A-level exam season in May.The Government’s 28-page coronavirus action plan stated that, if the virus becomes established in the UK, action that would be considered could include population distancing strategies such as school closures … to slow the spread of the disease throughout the population”.It added: The UK governments\u0027 education departments\u0027 planning assumptions include the possibility of having to close educational settings in order to reduce the spread of infection.Ministers emphasised closures would be a last resort, but parents and teachers expressed anxiety on social media about the prospect of pupils\u0027 education being interrupted.Martin Clee, a science teacher from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, added on Twitter: If Covid-19 goes big and mass school closures happened, say towards the end of Maybeginning of June, what happens to exam season?At least 10 schools are currently closed for deep cleaning following the return of either staff or pupils from one of the countries where the virus has taken hold. Around 19 more have only just reopened.Official advice was not to close schools but to isolate inidual pupils or teachers suspected to have contracted the virus before calling Public Health England.But there have been complaints about conflicting advice. Parents said they have been left confused by some schools sending pupils home to self-isolate while others shut altogether.The latest to shut was Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, which closed temporarily on Tuesday after a parent of a pupil tested positive for the virus. A deep-clean of the school will take place before it reopens.Some pupils at the school had recently returned from a skiing holiday to northern Italy, but headteacher Mark Bellamy said the case was not linked to the trip. In a letter to parents, he wrote: “Last week, I chose to keep the school open following advice from the Government and Public Health England.Today, as I believe this confirmed case directly impacts on my students and staff, I am closing the school.Whitehall sources said efforts were currently being focused on replacing teachers who had fallen ill by allowing colleagues from other schools to take their place or enabling children to travel to other schools.The Government could also relax class sizes beyond the maximum of 30 allowed in primary schools, allowing schools where one or more teacher is sick to send children elsewhere.Ministers are anxious to avoid widespread closures not only because it would disrupt children’s education but because it would place a wider strain on the workforce, with working parents forced to stay at home to look after their children.Government influenza pandemic preparedness strategies warned that school closures would place a significant pressure on health workers, handicapping their ability to come into work at a time when they are most needed.Teaching unions also expressed concerns over the prospect of an increase in class sizes, warning it could even make the risk of infection worse.Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said: A cramped classroom will not keep pupils safe, potentially doing more harm than good, and arguably work directly against the \u0027social distancing\u0027 recommended in the action plan. It will not provide peace of mind for parents.Care homes have been advised to go into lockdown in the event of a major coronavirus outbreak, with visitors banned and sick patients confined to their bedrooms.Providers across the country have been issued with new guidance to prevent the virus from spreading among vulnerable and elderly residents, and health chiefs urged relatives not to go and visit your auntie in a care home if suffering from a cold or flu-like symptoms.At least two care homes in Britain have temporarily shut over concerns that residents may have come into contact with a confirmed coronavirus case. Death rates have shown that Covid-19 poses a far greater danger to the elderly and those suffering underlying health problems. Care homes are also feared to be at heightened risk because of the close living conditions.Professor Chris Whitty, the Government\u0027s chief medical officer, has said officials are keen not to take stringent measures, such as banning visitors from care homes at which no cases have been identified, too early because of the social cost involved.However, guidance issued by the Care Provider Alliance, the industry body representing adult social care providers in England, describes how care homes should go into effective lockdown if a resident is diagnosed with coronavirus.The Coronavirus Infection and Prevention Toolkit document says patients should be kept in their bedrooms rather than automatically being sent to hospital. If it is not possible to isolate people – for example, those who need dementia support or other specialist needs – symptomatic iniduals should be cared for in an area that can be separated from those who are unaffected, it adds.The guidance also advises care providers to consider restricting visits from all relatives until the outbreak is over and refuse to admit any new clients. It may be necessary to contact regular visitors and ask them not to visit the care setting during the outbreak of infection, it says.Care providers are also told to restrict the use of new agency staff in the event of a coronavirus case to lessen exposure to the disease.If this is unavoidable, block-book staff during the outbreak to limit the numbers of inidual agency staff potentially affected, the advice adds.  If staff are taken ill as a result of being exposed to the infection, you should follow national and local guidance on how to prevent the spread of the infection.Wales\u0027 chief medical officer, Dr Frank Atherton said: If you think about the most vulnerable populations, they are often in nursing homes or care homes. I think we need to intensify the advice to people that, if you have a cold or flu-like illness, don\u0027t go and visit your auntie in a care home.In the US, an outbreak of coronavirus in a nursing home near Seattle has left one resident dead and four others in hospital, three of them in critical condition. Of the home\u0027s 108 residents and 180 staff members, more than 50 have shown signs of possible Covid-19 infections, officials said.The Government\u0027s chief scientific and medical advisers have told holidaymakers to go abroad wherever they want – as long as they make sure their destination has decent healthcare.The advice follows the cancellation of hundreds of flights by airlines, with tourists and business travellers either scrapping travel plans or refusing to commit to bookings. Coronavirus has hit the airline industry particularly hard, with the value of the world\u0027s biggest airlines plunging by billions of pounds. Consumer groups warned that families who have booked to go on Easter holidays have been left confused in the wake of the outbreak, unsure over whether their trips are covered by insurance, whether it is safe to travel and whether flights will be cancelled anyway.One airline expert warned that the cost of some flights could rise, with routes scrapped to match dwindling demand.The chief advisers on the virus moved to clear up confusion over international travel at a news conference unveiling the Government\u0027s coronavirus action plan.Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, said that the risks of travelling on holiday or for business are no greater than staying in the UK as soon as Covid-19 becomes widespread.Once the epidemic is everywhere, then actually restricting travel makes no difference at all, he said. At the moment we are certainly not recommending any change to behaviours in relation to that. If it grows in the UK, then of course it doesn\u0027t really make more sense to say that you\u0027re at more risk somewhere else than you are here.Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, advised people against travel to countries with a weaker health system than the NHS and suggested they choose a location based on the quality of treatment that would be available.If you happen to be in a place with a very weak health service at the peak of their epidemic, weaker than the NHS, that obviously might be more problematic – and this is particularly an issue for people who are older or have pre-existing health conditions, Prof Whitty said.The Coronavirus action plan says Foreign Office travel advice provides the necessary information for British nationals ... on what they need to know before deciding whether to travel and what to do if they are affected by an outbreak of Covid-19 while travelling.On Monday, both British Airways and Ryanair announced flight cuts, with BA dropping 432 flights between March 16 and March 28, and Ryanair cutting a quarter of flights to and from Italy between March 17 and April 8.But at a meeting of airline executives in Brussels on Monday, bosses warned of further economic damage to come. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways owner IAG, said there had been  a very significant fall-off in demand in Europe, especially in Italy, but predicted that it would stabilise in the coming weeks following a pattern seen in Asia.Emma Wiseman, a spokeswoman for flight comparison website Skyscanner, said a study of the cost of flights to 10 destinations from the UK for both February and June showed prices fluctuating with no obvious link to the virus spread.But Ms Wiseman warned of rises on routes where flights had been cut, including London to New York – which has seen flights in June rise by an average of 10 per cent. It\u0027s too early to say if recent events are likely to drive any permanent changes to flight pricing, she added.Martyn James, of consumer complaints service Resolver, said more customers were cancelling holidays because of illness or fears over coronavirus. He said customer complaints to travel firms using terms like flu had more than doubled in February compared to the same period last year.Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, said: While the decision to cancel flights in the face of growing concerns around the spread of coronavirus may be understandable, passengers due to travel will want to know what this means for their plans, especially in the run-up to the Easter holidays.Given the circumstances, airlines should also consider offering flexibility to customers who don\u0027t want to travel, such as allowing refunds and waiving flight change fees for both existing and future bookings.The Government\u0027s action plan for dealing with coronavirus raises the prospect of major sporting and cultural events being cancelled in an attempt to stem the spread of the disease.The 28-page plan says population distancing strategies intended to reduce the risk of the virus spreading further could be implemented if the situation becomes worse.This may include reducing the number of large scale gatherings, raising the prospect that events such as the London Marathon, the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, football matches and music and arts festivals could be postponed.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said on Tuesday that it was far too early to be able to tell whether the London Marathon would need to be cancelled, but did not rule it out if the virus became more widespread. The race is scheduled to take place in eight weeks, with one million spectators set to line the route. London Marathon Events said it was monitoring developments closely.At the same time, European football\u0027s governing body, UEFA, announced emergency working groups involving the Premier League and other governing bodies to cope with a potential fixture pile-up if matches are cancelled.The Premier League, Football Association and English Football League have discussed a worst-case scenario option of games being played behind closed doors if coronavirus spreads.Contingency options have been discussed by officials in the past week in case the Government orders a major shutdown of mass gatherings, as has been seen in Switzerland and France. It is understood the Premier League would consider playing matches in front of empty stands if it allowed the season to be completed.Inidual sports stars are increasingly likely to find themselves caught up in the crisis as the disease gains hold in the UK.England prop Mako Vunipola will miss the rest of the Six Nations after going into self-isolation over coronavirus fears, it emerged on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the England team said Vunipola had withdrawn from the squad after management discovered he had stopped over in Hong Kong, where there have been around 100 cases, on a flight back from Tonga at the weekend.A severe worsening of the coronavirus outbreak could also raise the prospect of the Grand National being cancelled.

He also said it was in breach of its legal duty to uphold free speech. As far as I am aware, no one connected with the College made an effort to ensure Prof Todd\u0027s freedom of speech was protected, said Mr Young. The decision by the organisers to no-platform Prof Todd ... was particularly egregious given that she had helped get the conference put on.He added that when fellow speakers threatened to withdraw, the event\u0027s organisers should have told them that they would not be bullied into dropping Prof Todd. Sir Edward Leigh, the Tory MP for Gainsborough, has also written to the universities minister asking her to investigate. An Exeter College spokesman said it has received a complaint about the event which will be reviewed in accordance with our complaints and appeals procedures. Oxford\u0027s history faculty said it had been pleased to support the event, but added that it withdrew its support when Prof Todd\u0027s invitation to speak was rescinded. We cannot accept the exclusion of our respected colleague Prof Selina Todd from the event, and that means that we withdrew from the weekend’s celebration, a spokesman said. As an academic department, we simply cannot condone the no-platforming of people who hold and express lawful views. We believe it is always better to debate than to exclude: this seems to us a key principle of 1970, and we are sorry that the weekend\u0027s event took a different path.”An Exeter College spokesman said that it played no role in decisions about the event\u0027s programme or speakers. Exeter College is committed to the open and respectful discussion of ideas and to providing a supportive and inclusive environment in which the rights and dignity of all its staff and students are respected and valued, and in which people can work and study, without fear of discrimination or harassment, they added. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"super tuesday 2020 live voting updates latest results bernie2","story":"\u0027Joementum\u0027 proves true: Biden takes Texas and 8 other states while Sanders wins CaliforniaSanders expected to lead race when full California results emergeHow Joe Biden came back from the dead in the race for the White House Bloomberg\u0027s bad night leaves him reconsidering campaign Analysis: Biden owes surge to overwhelming African-American support Which candidates are left in the race?Joe Biden\u0027s campaign bounced back on \u0027Super Tuesday\u0027 with sweeping victories in key southern states, but Bernie Sanders appears to have won California, the biggest prize of the night.Mr Biden took eight states, including the battleground states of North Carolina and Virginia, while Mr Sanders has won Utah, Colorado and his home state of Vermont.The two candidates are in a close runoff in Texas, the state with the second largest number of delegates on offer tonight. Tuesday night\u0027s results are a huge blow for Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and billionaire, who poured more than $500 million of his personal fortune into campaign. The two other candidates still in the race, Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, and Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman, are both also facing serious questions about their viability. Expert insight and exclusive analysis on the 2020 election, written by our US team.Nick Allen reports from Texas:In a result virtually no one predicted Joe Biden has triumphed in Texas, the second biggest state.

More than one million people cast their ballots days ago during an early voting period, and Mr Sanders had a clear lead among those votes. But exit polls showed among people who voted on election day, and decided only in the last few days, Mr Biden won nearly 50 per cent. Only one in five of those voters went for Mr Sanders. Even Hiic voters who decided in the last few days favoured Mr Biden over Mr Sanders.It was a result of the momentum Mr Biden got from his landslide win in South Carolina on Saturday. The endorsement of former Texas congressman Beto O\u0027Rourke on Monday was also a factor. Mr Biden did particularly well in suburban areas. In Texas\u0027s most populous county, Harris County, which includes the rapidly growing city of Houston, he beat Mr Sanders by seven points. Mr Biden was also a clear winner in Dallas.Joe Biden is projected to win Texas.Mr Sanders had been heavily favoured to win in Texas. but Mr Biden invested heavily in the state and was banking on a late surge.Some of Mr Biden\u0027s late surge can be credited to local Beto O\u0027Rourke, a former presidential candidate, who endorsed the former Vice President last night. The pair dined a Whataburger in Dallas last night. Whataburger is a Texan fast food institution and became synonymous with Mr O\u0027Rourke\u0027s 2018 run for the US senate. Mr O\u0027Rourke livestreamed the whole event, and it was widely watched across Texas.Former New York Mayor Bloomberg had massive spending in the state and appeared to be taking a share of the moderate vote, and with more than half the precincts reporting was in third with 16 per cent of the vote.Bernie Sanders has put his grassroots movement at the heart of his campaign, arguing he can increase turn out more than any of his competitors. But that claim is now under scrutiny after a massive increase in turnout in Virginia handed Joe Biden a victory. Virginia is seen as America in miniature - its mix of white, rural voters and erse, suburban voters reflects the challenges candidates face appealing to a broad voter base across the country. Hillary Clinton carried the state in 2016 and since then Democrats have swept into several state-wide posts.  But with turnout on Tuesday nearly double that of 2016, Mr Sanders lost to Mr Biden by around 30 points. Deadly tornadoes knocked out polling places in Tennessee, fears over the coronavirus left some precincts short of election workers and long lines frustrated voters in California and Texas as Super Tuesday sent voters surging to the polls in 14 states.Scattered reports of polling places opening late, machines malfunctioning or voter rolls being down temporarily disrupted voting in some of the states voting, but there were no widespread reports of voters being unable to cast a ballot or security breaches.Meanwhile voter file databases were down or excruciatingly slow in some counties in California and Texas. In Los Angeles County, electronic pollbooks that are connected to the state\u0027s voter database were operating slowly because of the high number of voters, official Mike Sanchez said. It caused delays of more than two hours in some locations.In Texas, elections officials in the Houston area were sending additional voting machines to polling places after people reported hours-long wait times. A voting-rights group said the problem seemed most acute in heavily black and Latino neighborhoods.Here\u0027s how the New York Post reacted to Tuesday night\u0027s results: The result of the Maine Primary is still on a knife edge, David Millward writes.With 84 per cent of the votes counted, Joe Biden has a a 1,391 lead over Bernie Sanders. The lead has changed hands several times during the night and it looks as if this race will go to the wire.As with other states in New England, Elizabeth Warren appears to damaged Mr Sanders peeling away progressive votes from the Vermont senator, costing him what would have been a reasonably comfortable win in the state. She is likely to come under pressure to abandon her tilt at the White House to enable toe left to united behind Mr Sanders - following the example of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar who stepped aside to give Mr Biden a clear run.Elizabeth Warren\u0027s campaign is still urging supporters to donate, suggesting the Massachusetts senator plans to push ahead with her candidacy. This may concern some Sanders supporters, who believe Ms Warren has split the progressive vote, handing Joe Biden a strong night. The race for the Democratic nomination is effectively down to a tight two-way race after almost a third of US states cast their ballots on Super Tuesday, with front-runners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders drawing support from sharply ergent groups.It\u0026#39s now a two-way race between Bernie and BidenEdison Research\u0027s exit polling shines some light on where the splits are most apparent:African Americans, older people and college graduates largely supported Mr Biden, helping him win at least eight states.Latinos, millennials and white men largely backed Mr Sanders, helping him to likely wins in the western states of Colorado and delegate-rich California.Mr Biden and Mr Sanders also split the vote in Texas, as the candidates\u0027 demographic advantages essentially canceled each other out.Roughly half of Super Tuesday voters made up their minds in the last few days. The lion\u0027s share of those late deciders backed Mr Biden.What a gripping night this is shaping up to be. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden appear to be neck and neck in Texas, the state with the second largest number of delegates available tonight. CNN polls show a margin of three points between the two candidates.Here\u0027s the demographic breakdown: Brad Parscale, Donald Trump\u0027s 2020 campaign manager, predicts tonight\u0027s results will end with a brokered convention, where no one candidate has enough delegates to win outright before the July event. In a statement, Mr Parscale said: “The results only increase the likelihood that no candidate will have enough delegates for a first ballot victory at their convention, which only means more chaos! The media is hyperventilating about Joe Biden but everyone should remember that he is just as terrible a candidate right now as he was a few days ago.At the same time, establishment Democrats have ganged up to try to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination, which is causing even more mayhem. Even if Bernie is not on November’s ballot, his big government socialist ideas will be because they have become mainstream in today’s Democrat Party. President Trump will wipe the floor with whatever Democrat is unlucky enough to be the nominee.”Polls have closed in delegate-rich California, with exit polls giving Bernie Sanders a 15-point lead in the state. If Mr Sanders maintains that lead, it will help him regain an edge on Joe Biden.There may be some tension in the Conway household tonight. George Conway, lawyer and husband to President Trump\u0027s senior aide Kellyanne Conway, has tweeted his support for Joe Biden. Mr Conway donated the maximum amount of $2,800 allowed for inidual donors to Mr Biden\u0027s campaign.Bernie Sanders\u0027 campaign requested an emergency injunction  asking for polls in Los Angeles County to stay open for an extra two hours after reports of delays and long lines in the Democratic primary vote.According to the request filed with Los Angeles County elections chief Dean Logan, multiple polling locations in the County have experienced extreme wait times for iniduals to vote, including wait times up to four hours to cast a ballot.Los Angeles County is one of several big jurisdictions in California that used new voting machines and procedures in the Super Tuesday primary.David Millward in Maine has this analysis on the New England results:It is no surprise that Bernie Sanders won Vermont. Things are looking interesting elsewhere in New England. There are signs that Elizabeth Warren is splitting the progressive vote. In her home state of Massachusetts, she is running in third place but has been backed by more than 20 per cent of voters.This is good news for Joe Biden, who has opened a seven per cent lead over over Mr Sanders.In Maine the result is on a knife edge where with nearly half the votes counted, Mr Sanders leads by just over 100 votes. Ms Warren has received nearly 15,000 votes, which could prove decisive.Joe Biden has won Massachusetts, which has 91 delegates at stake.Massachusetts was considered a must-win state for its home-state candidate, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, and election officials predicted high turnout. Nearly 230,000 voters took advantage of early voting last week, the first time the state has allowed early voting in a presidential primary.Ms Warren\u0027s viability in the race is now in serious doubt. Earlier today Mr Sanders\u0027 campaign refused to say whether Ms Warren should drop out of the race and endorse his campaign - something many progressive voters had urged - but it has cost Mr Sanders in some states. Meanwhile Mr Sanders has won the Utah primary, according to current projections. He won the state in 2016  against Hillary Clinton.Joe Biden hailed Super Tuesday as a good night that was getting even better as he addressed a crowd at his campaign HQ in Los Angeles, California. He has projected wins in seven states against three for Bernie Sanders. However the biggest prizes of the night - California and Texas - have yet to be declared.Jubilant Joe Biden takes selfies with supportersBen Riley-Smith, our US editor, watched the candidate working the line up close. Here\u0027s his report: Joe Biden was pumped up for his celebratory speech in Los Angeles, more energised than almost all of his campaign event stops in recent weeks. There\u0027s a reason they call it Super Tuesday! he said to a crowd of hundreds on a basketball court in the city - a rare outdoor event for a candidate. After the speech he headed to the audience, posing for selfies, giving hugs and shaking hands with jubilant supporters and, at one point, holding up a dog. One supporter had brought a giant Hope\u0027 Barack Obama poster, which he held aloft and repeatedly urge Mr Biden to sign. The supporter was, in the end, too far away to be heard.  Ed Hunsaker, who lives in LA and has been hoping for a Biden presidency for more than a decade, was watching on and said it had been a great night for the candidate.  Biden is a street-level guy. He knows what it means to try and get ahead, to get food on the table, Mr Hunsaker told The .  He gets that. He\u0027s never strayed from what he is.Paul Koretz, 64, who sits on the LA city council, was also looking on and said he did not predict this recent surge.  I have to admit a few days ago I did not see that coming. I\u0027m a Biden supporter through and through and I would have been with him to the end.  I\u0027ve been around politics for 50 years and I\u0027ve never seen a sudden turnaround like this ever before. Biden hails \u0026#34a great night\u0026#34 in Los AngelesMr Biden\u0027s speech was briefly disrupted by a handful of female protesters who attempted to jump onto the stage with anti-dairy signs. The first woman to reach the raised platform the former US vice president was speaking from managed to clamber up, forcing him to stop speaking.  Amid the commotion a security guard managed to manhandle the protester off the stage after a couple of seconds, but then more people rushed froward.  What appeared to be Mr Biden\u0027s secret service detail - he continues to have one thanks to the eight years he spent in the White House - intervened.  The protesters appeared to be against big dairy. They were the same group who interrupted Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, on Monday night during a speech in Los Angeles. Joe Biden has won Minnesota, Arkansas, according to exit polls in the state. Minnesota, which has 75 delegates up for grabs, is the home state of Amy Klobuchar, who suspended her campaign on Monday and endorsed the former Vice President. Bernie Sanders carried the state in 2016 and Ms Klobuchar\u0027s army of grass roots staff is being credited for Mr Biden\u0027s success in the state tonight.Meanwhile, Donald Trump is revelling in Mike Bloomberg\u0027s poor results.Bernie Sanders is taken the stage at a rally in his home state of Vermont, where he promises to win the Democratic nomination and defeat the “political establishment”.  You know, it\u0027s a funny thing, 31 years ago today we won the mayor race in Burlington, Vermont. And we won that race against all of the odds. Everybody said it couldn\u0027t be done. And when we began this race for the presidency, everybody said it couldn\u0027t be done. But tonight I tell you with absolute confidence, we are going to win the Democratic nomination. And we are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of the country, he told the crowd in Essex JunctionNick Allen has an update from Texas:With a third of the vote in Bernie Sanders is winning the showdown in Texas. But it\u0027s far from over. Mr Sanders had a lead of about five points - 28 per cent to 23 per cent - over a resurgent Joe Biden, less than had been expected.Voters cast ballots at the politan Multi-Service Center polling station in Houston, TexasInterestingly, Michael Bloomberg is competitive with 19 per cent. All those adverts must have gained some traction. The largest population centre in Texas is Harris County, which includes the rapidly growing city of Houston. Mr Sanders and Mr Biden are tied there, with Mr Bloomberg just behind. In Travis County, which includes the liberal city of Austin, Mr Sanders is running away with it, followed by Elizabeth Warren.Overall, it seems that Mr Sanders has done well in the early vote - one million Texans voted early - but less well on election day. Mr Bloomberg is doing better than expected, and that may have taken votes away from Mr Biden.Mike Bloomberg will reassess his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on Wednesday, according to NBC News.Here\u0027s a quick recap of the billionaire\u0027s spending in the Super Tuesday race:$224 million overall he spent on ads that ran in the 14 states voting today, according to data from Advertising AnalyticsOf that figure, $33.7 million went on TV, radio and digital adverts in Alabama, North Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, all of which have been called for his his opponentsJoe Biden is projected to have won Tennessee, but appears to have lost a few potential delegates to Mike Bloomberg. The state is a Republican strong hold and Democrats here tend to lean more towards the centre ground than in other states.  Exit polls project another win for Joe Biden - this time in Oklahoma, where the former vice president is currently around 12 points ahead of Bernie Sanders.The results appears to confirm Elizabeth Warren is having a very bad night. The Massachusetts senator grew up in Oklahoma and is struggling to cross the 15 per cent threshold required to win delegates.Mike Bloomberg is ignoring the Super Tuesday states, where he\u0027s faring poorly so far, and is focusing on the key swing state of Florida which votes on March 17. But reflecting the mood of the night, billionaire businessman left the stage after a lacklustre 10 minutes, in which he appeared to conceded he may not achieve the delegate wins he anticipated tonight. Bloomberg\u0026#39s campaign are worried by the early resultsThe billionaire businessman told a crowd in West Palm Beach:  “As the results come in, here’s what is clear. No matter how many delegates we win tonight we’ve done something no-one else thought was possible. We’ve gone from one percent in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.”Mr Bloomberg has spent $500 million of his own money on campaign advertising and his campaign are understandably worried by the results in North Carolina and Virginia. His candidacy is now in doubt. Bernie Sanders has won the Colorado primary. The Vermont senator had been expected to win the state, which has 67 delegates up for grabs.David Millward reports that Bernie Sanders\u0027 supporters remain buoyant despite Joe Biden\u0027s early leads.Mike Bloomberg is projected to have won the American Samoa primary. The US territory has a population of 57,000 and sends 10 delegates to the Democratic Convention.Mr Bloomberg was widely expected to win here - having hired seven full-time staff and advertising heavily on radio, TV and in the local press.It appears to be a bad night for Elizabeth Warren, who may suffer the embarrassment of losing her home state of Massachusetts. According to CNN\u0027s exit poll, the state is a toss up between Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and the Massachusetts senator.Biden is projected to win a third state - Alabama, which has 52 delegates. All three states the former US vice president is projected to have won so far - Virginia, North Carolina and Alabama - have sizeable African American populations. If Mr Biden continues this success in the remaining southern states he may be able to offset any expected losses in California and Texas.Joe Biden is projected to score huge victories in Virginia and North Carolina and front-runner Bernie Sanders was expected to win his home state of Vermont, the first states to close their polls.A resurgent Biden has enjoyed a burst of momentum since a blowout win in South Carolina on Saturday, which led to endorsements from a flood of prominent party officials and former rivals.Key endorsements in Virginia include former governor Terry McAuliffe and Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer who managed an impressive victory in a Republican district in the state in 2018. This will stand Mr Biden in good stead in the state. It is a strong start for Joe BidenWith 14 per cent of the precincts reporting in Virginia, Mr Biden was winning more than half of the votes in that Southern swing state, well ahead of Mr Sanders, who was winning about a quarter of the vote.The former Vice President is also hoping to muscle aside Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor, and consolidate support from moderates in Tuesday\u0027s voting, turning the race into a one-on-one contest against Mr Sanders.Sanders supporters cheer for early results at his rally in Essex Junction, VermontOpinion polls have shown Mr Biden gaining on Mr Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, who hopes to take a huge step toward winning the nomination on Tuesday.Early exit polls by Edison Research showed Mr Biden was powered once again by strong support among African-American voters, winning more than six of every 10 in Virginia and North Carolina.In Virginia, Mr Biden also won the votes of more than four of 10 white college educated women, compared to about two in 10 each for Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.Joe Biden is projected to win Virginia, CBS News is reporting. Elizabeth Warren\u0027s campaign has just announced a string of campaign events for later this week, signalling the Massachusetts senator has no plans to drop out of the race anytime soon. Ms Warren is travelling to Michigan for a town hall event on Friday, followed by one in Phoenix, Arizona and Boise, Idaho on Saturday. Ben Riley-Smith has this from a polling station in a liberal part of the cityOne of Bernie Sanders\u0027s great advantages is the enthusiasm and energy he engenders in his supporters, who then take to the streets to help his cause.  There was a good example of this at a polling station in South Pasadena, an affluent bit of Los Angeles, where more than a thousand voters are expected.  With a few dozen people queueing outside a rather grand library under the clear blue sky to vote, there was a volunteer from only one campaign around. Her name was Linda Krausen, a 78-year-old retiree, and she is a big Bernie fan. She had Bernie earrings, a Bern necklace and light blue nail paint.  Every time a voter approached she went across to explain how the computer system worked, reminding them you have to press \u0027next\u0027 on the candidates page to find everyone on the ballot. She was handing out a single piece of paper, some in English and some in Spanish, that outlined Mr Sanders\u0027s pitch.  Bernie is the candidate whose platform most strongly supports working people of America, one line read.  Ms Krausen also said she had been up until 3am last night going round the area putting out Bernie flyers for people to see today.  She said one voter told her she was going to back Joe Biden but then saw a Bernie poster on her car this morning and decided to switch at the last minute. Times that activism by 2,000 - the number of people the Sanders campaign has on the ground across LA County, according to officials - and you get a sense of the scale of the Bernie ground game.  Who knows how big an impact all those volunteers could have? Nick Allen in Texas reports:   There have been reports of some Texan voters waiting up to two hours to cast their ballots.It seems to be a mixture of high turnout and technical problems at some polling stations.Voter Austin Black told local TV he waited two hours at a public library in Dallas.The Dallas County elections department said there were longer than usual wait times.Pictures emerged of a long line outside a polling station at a court building in Mansfield, and at a Dallas location three out of the four voting machines were not working.Powerful tornadoes tore through Nashville, Tennessee and surrounding counties early on Tuesday, killing at least 22 people, leaving others missing and reducing homes and businesses to rubble as voters throughout the state cast ballots in the Super Tuesday presidential primary.In addition to the fatalities, at least 30 people were injured and about 48 buildings were destroyed in Nashville, with many more damaged, Fire Department Director Chief William Swann said. Tens of thousands of people were left without power.Despite the destruction, polling sites were mostly open for voting, officials said.Crushed vehicles, piles of debris and broken power lines littered streets blocked by rescue vehicles. Residents carried away belongings from ravaged homes.Donald Trump said that he will go to Tennessee on Friday.Nick Allen is seeing high voter turnout in San Antonio.At the public library in San Antonio a steady stream of voters made their way to polling machines. By lunchtime 271 people had voted. Anecdotal evidence from election officials suggested that was high. It came despite about 10 per cent of voters casting their ballots early before Election Day. An election official told me voting is expected to be boosted by a recent rule change. Previously, voters had to vote at a specific assigned polling station. But this time they can vote at any location. “It means we’re getting a lot of people coming in on their lunch hour because they work downtown,” said the official. “In the past they wouldn’t have had time to go home to vote.“ She added: ”It does feel larger than last time, although it’s hard to tell for sure.” Facing voters for the first time, Mike Bloomberg believes the only way he can win the nomination is at a contested convention in the summer.Well, I don\u0027t think that I can win any other ways, he said according to NBC.A brokered convention will almost inevitably trigger accusations from Bernie Sanders’ supporters that the Vermont Senator will have been the victim of an establishment “stitch-up.Mr Bloomberg, however, has dismissed the idea rounding on Mr Sanders.There are rules in the Democratic Party of how you go about this. And I did see Bernie Sanders said all of a sudden, he didn\u0027t want to follow the rules ... I find it offensive that Bernie Sanders, who the last time he ran was in favour of that kind of a convention, and now was opposed to it. I guess where you stand depends on where you sit.Mr Bloomberg, who is being urged to clear the path for Joe Biden by following the example of Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, is also showing no interest in pulling out of the race in which he has invested an estimated $500 million.Traders have been betting heavily on the Democratic race, according to Smarkets - a UK based prediction market platform. They have bet nearly $2.5 million on the outcome and the smart money seems to be going on Joe Biden, who has surged from eight per cent to 54 per cent to become the market favourite, overtaking Bernie Sanders who has slipped into second place at 35 per cent.Mike Bloomberg is trailing badly in third place at six per cent.But the bullish predictions for Mr Biden appear to have been undermined by the predictions for several of the key races, with the Vermont senator remaining favourite to win California, Texas and Massachusetts.There is growing speculation that California senator, Kamala Harris is set to endorse Joe Biden.Rumours have been circulating for a few weeks that she will throw her weight behind the former vice president.Now the gossip is that an endorsement is imminent.But few will forget how she skewered him in an early candidate’s debate over his record on race and his opposition to bussing, a policy which was used to desegregate schools“There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,” she said. “And that little girl was me.”Mr Biden was stunned by her remarks, accusing Ms Harris of a “mischaracterisation” of his position.Assuming the pair have patched up their differences, Ms Harris’s endorsement would be a huge boost for Mr Biden in California as he tries to head off Bernie Sanders in the delegate-rich state.Ben Riley-Smith, our US Editor, has this from a chat with a Bernie fanWhy does Donald Trump keep talking about Bernie Sanders being robbed of the Democratic nomination? A conversation with a Sanders fan in Los Angeles provides an insight. David Nesbitt is a 54-year-old software engineer. I found him leaning against a wall in a blue Bernie T-shirt on Sunday, having just seen the Sanders rally with more than 10,000 others. I asked about moderate dropouts. Pete Buttigieg had just quite the race out hours earlier. This was before he and two other presidential rivals endorsed Mr Biden on Monday. Key dates for the democratic hopefulsThe ‘they’ in this case appeared to be the Democratic Party establishment. The suggestion - moderate leaders believe Mr Sanders cannot win and were moving to stop his path. Then I asked Mr Nesbitt if he would vote for Mr Biden if he ended up as the nominee. There was a very long pause, perhaps more than six seconds, face scrunched in thought. “I might, I don’t know,” he eventually said. “We’ll see.” He said he would never vote for Mr Trump, but did pledge to back whichever Democrat is on the ballot. This happened to Mr Nesbit in 2016. Mr Sanders lost the primaries, Hillary Clinton won. He did not vote for Ms Clinton, picking Jill Stein, the Green Party instead.Scores of others did likewise. It is one of the factors Ms Clinton most often cites when she is asked about the reasons behind her shock defeat to Mr Trump in 2016. Mr Nesbit pointed out that it did not matter how he voted in California, which will always go Democrat. He is right. But in the swing states, this could be a massive factor. If Bernie loses and his army sits on its hands or votes for a third party candidate, either because they do not believe in or feel betrayed by the Democratic nominee, it helps Mr Trump. Which is why the US president is doing all he can to whip up aggrievment now. This just in from Ben Riley-SmithDonald Trump has accused Democratic moderates of trying to rig the presidential nomination race against Bernie Sanders after a string of last-minute endorsements for his rival. The US president attempted to pour fuel on the isions in the party as voters went to the polls in 14 different states yesterday to pick who they want to take on Mr Trump. Speaking at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, the night before voting, Mr Trump said: “It’s being rigged against Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie’s going to go crazy.”He accused Joe Biden, the former US vice president who was endorsed by three of his previous rivals in the race, of orchestrating an attempt to stop the Vermont senator.“They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal,” Mr Trump told his supporters. On Twitter he wrote: “They are staging a coup against Bernie!”Nick Allen in Texas writes:Joe Biden and Beto O\u0027Rourke chowed down at a Whataburger in Dallas last night. Whataburger is a Texan fast food institution and became synonymous with Mr O\u0027Rourke\u0027s 2018 run for the US senate.Beto O\u0026#39Rourke enjoys a \u0026#34Whataburger\u0026#34 with Joe BidenHe went to Whataburger a lot.. This is a first, said Mr O\u0027Rourke, as he arrived with the former vice president in tow.Hey, folks. How are you? said Mr Biden. The two politicians then gladhanded the dozen customers inside before Mr Biden said: Let\u0027s get some food.Mr Biden ordered a Whataburger with cheese and tomato, fries and a vanilla milkshake, paying with cash. He then donned a Beto t-shirt and sat in a booth with Mr O\u0027Rourke and his wife Amy, remarking on how good the milkshake was.As he tends to do Mr O\u0027Rourke livestreamed the whole event, and it was widely watched across Texas.Ben Riley-Smith, our US Editor, has this from the West coastHello from Los Angeles where the sun is shining and the polls are open. California is the most consequential state voting today. Why? Because of the massive haul of delegates - the metric that will determine the winner - up for grabs. There are 415 delegates available here. That is more than a quarter of all the Super Tuesday total. In fact it is a tenth of the entire nationwide delegate pot.Bernie Sanders, if the polls are right - a big if in today\u0027s politics, admittedly - has a massive lead here. In the latest poll of polls from Real Clear Politics he is 12 points ahead. But Joe Biden is surging, doubling his vote share and vaulting Elizabeth Warren according to the same rolling poll average. He was at 11 per cent on Friday, now 23 per cent today. Mr Sanders was here on Sunday. He held a raucous rally where actor Dick Van Dyke, comedian Sarah Silverman and Chuck D, the rapper from Public Enemy, all appeared on stage. (Yes, really.)Van Dyke, 94, joked about concerns over the 78-year-old\u0027s age, saying he was probably getting married the day Mr Sanders was born. Chuck D urged Californians to get off the couch and vote. He also performed Fight the Power, fist raised. Mr Biden has picked California for a results night event - an interesting selection, given he is not expected to win here. His wife, Jill Biden, also has a campaign stop-off in the day. Ms Warren held an outdoor rally here on Monday evening in East Los Angeles, a part of the city where the vast majority of the population are Hiic or Latino. There were a lot of placards in Spanish, with some reading persiste - in reference to a Senate speech when a Republican tried to shut her down and complained she persisted.Chants of It\u0027s  time for a woman in the White House and dream big, fight hard rung out. At the end a van served churros with caramel sauce to the departing supporters. Whoever wins here today may well have a delegate lead in the overall race come Wednesday. Odds are that will be Mr Sanders. Nick Allen in Texas writes:Joe Biden gave a deeply personal speech last night when he accepted Pete Buttigieg\u0027s endorsement. And it is quite clear that Mr Buttigieg would play a big part in any future Biden administration.The two men appeared at a bar called The Foundry in Dallas, which is well known for its fried chicken. Mr Biden described how, during televised debates, he had looked across the stage at the young mayor and been reminded of his late son Beau.Perhaps that was why Mr Biden never attacked Mr Buttigieg during the debates. Mr Biden said: There hasn\u0027t been a harsh word between us since we started to compete.I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever done this before, but he reminds me of my son Beau.I know that may not mean much to most people, but to me it\u0027s the highest compliment I can give a man or woman.Like Beau he has a backbone like a ramrod. I promise you, over the course of your lifetime, you\u0027re going to end up seeing a hell of a lot more of Pete than you are of me.Rozina Saburis on the ground in Fairfax County, Virginia. She writes: State officials are taking no chances in trying to avoid the sort of embarrassing glitches which turned  Iowa’s caucus into a shambles.Voter turnout appears to be lower so far today in Fairfax County, the county\u0027s director of elections, Gary Scott, tells me. In Virginia people vote in the mornings. Turnout is about 7 per cent right now,which is a little below what we’d expected, he says.Mr Scott says they have received a lot of questions about the coronavirus, but doesn\u0027t believe it\u0027s had any impact on voting day. There have been no cases recorded in Virginia, however there is one voter who requested an absentee ballot as he is currently in quarantine in Washington state, he adds.A little tidbit - Fairfax County is the only locality in Virginia which provides ballots in four languages - Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean and English. Here\u0027s what the ballot paper looks like:Fairfax county\u0026#39s erse population means ballots are printed in four languagesPundits expect that pockets of the state like this, which are ethnically erse, will favour Bernie Sanders. But at a voting centre at Graham Road Elementary School, voters I spoke to appeared evenly split between Sanders, Biden and Bloomberg.One voter, Holly Griffiths, says she is hoping for a Sanders or Warren victory. Bloomberg is just a Democratic Trump to me. Biden was a great vice president but he had a great leader and I don’t really have a lot of faith in what he’s going to do, she tells me. We are leaning definitely towards Sanders because he’s been in politics a long time and he’s done a lot for civil rights and the LGBQT community, and this country is horrific for healthcare.Out in the Pacific, the American territory of American Samoa has a population of 57,000 and sends 10 delegates to the Democratic Convention.Something of a constitutional oddity, the population can vote in the presidential primaries but not the presidential election itself.Mr Bloomberg has hired seven full-time staff in Samoa and is also advertising heavily on radio, TV and in the local press.It looks to have paid off with Chief Fa’alagiga Nina Tua’au-Glaude announcing she is endorsing Mr Bloomberg.“He has my family\u0027s vote, and my village. That\u0027s why I am committing my time and effort to electing Mike president of the United States. He will bring integrity and honour to the White House.Mr Bloomberg’s senior adviser in Samoa, Karen Green, said he is fighting for every vote and delegate.“We are proud to have Chief Tua\u0027au-Glaude\u0027s support and to have the largest ground game here in American Samoa before we caucus on Super Tuesday,” she said.“Mike\u0027s history of getting things done, and particularly his record of accomplishment in combating climate change, is moving voters our way.Having performed well in the early contests, the decision of Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg to suspend their campaigns raised a few eyebrows.It will probably have annoyed a number of voters who cast their ballot ahead of Super Tuesday to no avail.“Mayor Pete”, despite doing exceptionally well in Iowa and New Hampshire appeared to have plateaued and was hovering at around 11 per cent in national polling.Failing to make any impact among Latinos and African-Americans, it was clear that he faced an uphill battle to get above the 15 per cent threshold which is normally required to secure delegates at the national convention.Ms Klobuchar’s decision was also something of a surprise to her staffers, according to the New York Times. She gave no indication that she was pulling the plug on her campaign when she addressed a rally in Salt Lake City on Monday morning.With Bernie Sander’s juggernaut laying waste to much of the field, there was an air of panic among the Democratic establishment that the Vermont senator could prove unstoppable.Late last week John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman who was the first Democrat to announce he was running for the White House, penned an oped in the Washington Post urging other moderates to follow his example and end their campaign - thus paving the way for a single mainstream candidate.John Delaney urged moderates to unite behind one candidate“Everyone who enters the race for president has something to offer,” he wrote.“But only one person can win the nomination — the person who best answers the central question that voters are asking at that moment. And sometimes, even your best stuff is not good enough.”While not naming Bernie Sanders, Mr Delaney made it clear that mainstream candidates who stayed in the race risked splitting the moderate vote with devastating consequences.“But if they stay in, they must ask themselves: Will they continue to make a positive difference, or will they steer the race toward a candidate who either can’t win or can’t govern and, in so doing, undermine everything they care about?”Nick Allen in Texas writes:On Monday Texas celebrated its Independence Day - the day it split from Mexico in 1836. “This used to be Mexico,” voter Sylvia Mendez, 46, told me in San Antonio. “Candidates have to reach out.”By 2022 Hiic people will become the largest population group in Texas, and they are voting more too. A recent poll showed 64 per cent intended to vote in the next presidential election. Healthcare is the most important issue, and Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All policy is proving popular.His Hiic supporters call him “Tio Bernie“ (Uncle Bernie) and “El Abuelito” (Grandpa). It’s going to be hard for other candidates to compete.Nick Allen in Texas writes:One might expect Democrats in Texas to be more conservative or moderate than those on the coasts. In 2016 Bernie Sanders got trounced in the state. Hillary Clinton got 65 per cent of the vote and Mr Sanders only 33 per cent.But something has changed. There has been a shift in the centre of gravity. A new Emerson College poll showed many of those who voted for Mrs Clinton four years ago are backing Mr Sanders this time.“What’s most interesting is watching Bernie Sanders competing in a state that he lost by 30 points just four years ago,” said Spencer Kimball, a professor involved in the poll.Another, slightly astonishing, CBS News poll showed 56 per cent of Democrat voters in Texas now view socialism positively, while only 37 per cent view capitalism positively.David Millward writes: Even though she abandoned her own bid for the White House, Amy Klobuchar emerged as one of the early stars of the campaign. Over the weekend she was darting around the country, taking in four states in one day rallying support.  Her barnstorming style and quick wit went down well with voters who turned out in ever-increasing numbers to hear her speak.She could prove a real asset for the former vice-president, especially in her native mid-west where the Democrats will need to regain voters who backed Donald Trump in 2016.Ms Klobuchar gave Mr Biden a resounding endorsement at a rally in Dallas on Monday night.“Joe Biden has dedicated his life to fighting for people,” Ms Klobuchar said, before introducing Biden at the rally in Dallas on Monday night.“Not for the rich and powerful, but for the mom, for the farmer, for the dreamer, for the veteran. He can bring our country together.”Nick Allen in Texas  writes:On the eve of Super Tuesday everyone seemed to turn up in the Lone Star state. Apart from the front runner Bernie Sanders. Joe Biden, who is hot on Mr Sanders’ heels, held his final rally in Dallas. Both Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar suspended their campaigns and erted to Texas to endorse him.A voter checks his phone before casting his ballot during the presidential primary in Houston, Texas On an extraordinary evening for Mr Biden he then got the backing of Beto O’Rourke (remember him?). Mr O’Rourke, like a returning contestant from a previous season, joined Mr Biden on stage and gave him a big hug. It was an endorsement that’s will carry some real weight in Texas.The polls - and there are many - have been all over the place, with one putting Mr Sanders 15 points ahead. But the latest has Mr Biden trailing by just five. The superbly timed endorsements could put him over the top.Rozina Sabur in Virginia writes:Virginia has 99 delegates up for grabs, the fourth largest of any state voting on Super Tuesday. Given the state\u0027s mix of economic and social ersity, a candidate\u0027s success here will be a good litmus test for how the rest of the country will vote. Hillary Clinton narrowly carried the state against Donald Trump in 2016, but Virginia will be an important state in determining the outcome of November\u0027s presidential election.The state\u0027s rural parts are deeply conservative but northern Virginia and university-educated women in the suburban areas contributed to the Republicans losing the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. Today\u0027s primary is expected to be a two horse race between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, with the urban, university areas expected to support the progressive senator and the suburban parts more likely to vote in favour of the former Vice President.Mike Bloomberg has also been competitive in recent polls and he has spent a lot of his money and time in the state.  A poll of polls shows Mr Biden and Mr Sanders averaging 29 per cent and 24 per cent respectively, with Mr Bloomberg on 14 per cent. Which candidate wins in Virginia may offer a clue of what is to come. Polls close between 7 pm and 8 pm local time, depending on the state. However most of the Super Tuesday states have some form of widespread early voting. Voters in Minnesota, for example, could start casting ballots in January. Millions of postal ballot papers went out to California voters on Feb. 3, the day of the Iowa caucuses.Number of delegates available in each stateBernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg have had the widest and most aggressive footprint across the Super Tuesday states, largely because they\u0027ve got the money to spend. Mr Bloomberg is advertising in all 14 states, while  Mr Sanders is on the airwaves in 12. It\u0027s the first time Mr Bloomberg will be on ballots after he skipped the first four voting states, making the day a critical test of his theory that he\u0027s the best candidate to stand against Mr Sanders and, later, Donald Trump.Mr Sanders spent Sunday in California, holding rallies in the state\u0027s major liberal strongholds. He\u0027s hoping his monthslong focus on the state and resonance with Latino voters will help him win a large chunk of the state\u0027s 415 delegates. Joe Biden also plans to be in the state today. He hopes his strong showing in South Carolina is a harbinger of coming success with black voters, who dominate the Democratic electorate in a handful of Super Tuesday states. Meanwhile Elizabeth Warren may suffer the embarrassment of losing the primary in her home state of Massachusetts to Mr Sanders. While Super Tuesday won\u0027t necessarily determine who wins the nomination, it has historically been difficult for a candidate who performs poorly on the day to recover. Here\u0027s a look at Tuesday\u0027s contests. As well as California and Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Vermont, Utah, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Oklahoma are holding votes. The Super Tuesday states make up a erse range of voter groups. Most of the Southern states are Republican strongholds in the general election, while others like California are solidly Democratic. North Carolina is likely to be a battleground state in the general election.In California and Texas, white voters make up less than half the population. Hiics count for nearly 40 per cent of the populations in both states. California, meanwhile, has the nation\u0027s highest Asian population, at roughly 15 per cent. North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama and Arkansas have large populations of black voters, one of the Democratic Party\u0027s core voting blocs. The states blend a mix of urban and rural voters, as well as Democrats from all sides of the political spectrum. As candidates focus on wooing Southern Democrats in states like Texas and Arkansas, they must also be thinking about a message that can resonate in progressive San Francisco.Good afternoon and welcome to the \u0027s live blog. Our reporters will be bringing you the latest from across the country as 14 states and one US territory cast their votes in the Democratic nomination contest. Super Tuesday is when roughly a third of Democratic voters will cast their vote in the party\u0027s presidential nomination, making it one of the most significant points in the race to take on Donald Trump. This year has added significance because California, the state with the most delegates, will also have its say on the same day.A candidate needs 1,990 delegates to become the party\u0027s nominee. California has 415 delegates available, followed by Texas which has 228 and North Carolina which has 110. In all, there are 1,357 delegates available today.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

More than 70 countries worldwide, in every continent bar Antarctica, have now diagnosed infections. But the worst hit has been South Korea, where the president declared war on the disease as infection numbers spiked by almost 1,000 in just 48 hours. Almost 5,200 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in total, including 31 fatalities.President Moon Jae-in ordered additional hospital beds and more face masks to be made available as reports emerged of medical staff collapsing with exhaustion.“The entire country has entered war against the infectious disease as the crisis in Daegu and Gyeongbuk province has reached the highest point,” he told a Cabinet meeting, referring to the two hardest-hit parts of the country.“I am very sorry to the people that we are not able to supply masks swiftly and sufficiently, and have caused inconvenience,” the President said.The majority of confirmed cases have been linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive movement that reveres its messiah-like founder Lee Man-hee, 88, and boasts hundreds of thousands of followers.The government of Seoul has asked for a murder investigation into the church, alleging that it was liable for its refusal to cooperate with efforts to stop the disease.Park Won-soon, mayor of the capital Seoul, claimed that if Mr Lee and other leaders of the church had cooperated, effective preventive measures could have saved those who later died of the virus.At a news conference on Monday, Mr Lee bowed and apologised on his knees for the outbreak.“Although it was not intentional, many people have been infected,” he said. “We put our utmost efforts, but were unable to prevent it all.”Nearby Japan has also been badly affected, with its own infection rate boosted by the docking of the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, where hundreds of passengers were diagnosed with the coronavirus during a two-week quarantine.Seiko Hashimoto, the minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, said the 2020 “games could be postponed until later this year.”The minister told a parliamentary meeting that the contract signed by the International Olympic Committee with the city stated that it had the right to cancel the games only if they could not be held in 2020.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/05/TELEMMGLPICT000210017597_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwQksq39z_LG8feNTt61Q-5E.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"forget wind turbines can meet net zero without derailing economy","story":"The idea that renewable energy could power the UK is delusionalTo meet the Conservatives’ net-zero emissions target, the UK will need around 40GW of new, low-carbon baseload generation by 2050. Technology undoubtedly holds the answer to achieving that. But it is no use setting our hopes on fashionable technologies simply for their superficial appeal.Sadly, however, the Government’s latest decision to revive onshore wind seems to fall into this trap. It is welcome that the plans will still give local people a strong say in new development decisions. Indeed, they should have the final say. But the problems of wind turbines go far beyond their being mere eyesores.Wind turbines are already close to their maximum theoretical efficiency – the Betz limit – and their effectiveness will always be determined by the wind available. Given that, for wind turbines to supply only the annual global growth in demand, nearly 350,000 would need to be built each year. This is 1.5 times as many as have been built since the early 2000s, and would require more land than the area of the British Isles every year.Allied to this, the mining of rare-earth metals in Mongolia for the magnets generates toxic and radioactive waste on a massive scale. It takes about 150 tonnes of coal to make a turbine. To build the 350,000 needed to meet growth, we would need 50 million tonnes of coal per year – about half the EU’s entire coal-mining output. The arithmetic is, therefore, against wind energy ever making a significant contribution to world energy supply. It is small wonder that the Renewable Energy Policy Network’s 2019 Global Status Report showed that wind and solar power together still provide just 2 per cent of global energy consumption or that former Chief Scientific Adviser to DECC Sir David MacKay declared the idea that renewable energy could power the UK an “appalling delusion” because there is simply not enough land.Clearly, we need to do better than onshore wind. Nuclear power is an obvious candidate, but there is a problem in achieving that capacity from large fission plants: there are neither enough suitable sites nor enough time to build them. Reaching the net-zero target would require opening a new Hinkley Point-sized station every four months until 2050. That could cost anything from £6 trillion if we could find enough civil engineers, even without the spiralling costs which similar projects have faced at the Olkiluoto nuclear project in Finland and at Flamanville in France. Both are struggling even to make the technology work.With modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), however, we see a proven technology which can provide power much more reliably than intermittent renewable sources. Rolls Royce estimates that each reactor – small enough to be transported by lorry – could provide the power equivalent of 150 onshore wind turbines. Lower construction costs through economies of series production, short construction time and the potential to use small reactors in Combined Heat and Power systems, make SMRs a technology with enormous potential to provide clean, sustainable and reliable energy.Implemented nationally, this revolutionary programme of localised electricity production would massively increase the resilience of the system, considerably improve energy efficiency overall, and ease pressure on the distribution system.In December 2017, the Government provided funding of up to £56 million over three years to support SMR research, which could facilitate an expansion in CHP. Outside the EU and its state aid rules, the Government must continue to make this a priority alongside plans for the first conceptual hydrogen fusion power plant by 2024. The Government announced a £200m investment into the project in October, designed to demonstrate commercial energy production by 2040. In a similar vein, the Advanced Propulsion Centre administers a £1bn Government investment fund for promising, low-emission powertrain technologies, including hydrogen fuel cells. In tandem, we should review our regulatory framework to ensure that the burdens and costs of regulation do not unduly hold back full commercial exploitation.The human race has come through adversity before, by harnessing the full potential of our creative, innovative power and fully exploiting the very latest technologies. The way to address the impact of greenhouse gas emissions now is to innovate our way out of the problem with cutting edge techniques.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

His dominating performance tonight represents one of the most remarkable comebacks in presidential primary history.Two factors are responsible for Biden\u0027s resurgence: the strength of his support among African American voters, and a rush of endorsements from former rivals for the Democratic nomination and prominent party leaders.Biden\u0027s longstanding ties to South Carolina and his eight years as Barack Obama\u0027s vice-president helped bring him his big victory there on Saturday, as did a crucial late endorsement from Representative Jim Clyburn.Biden\u0027s South Carolina win clearly precipitated a shift in Democratic leaders\u0027 thinking about the race. Pete Buttigieg dropped out and endorsed Biden on Sunday, while Amy Klobuchar did the same on Monday. Biden was also endorsed by Beto O\u0027Rourke, who ended his campaign months ago.State party leaders moved toward Biden as well. In Virginia, Biden racked up endorsements from Senator Tim Kaine, former senator John Warner, former governor Terry McAuliffe, and Representatives Bobby Scott and Don Beyer. In Texas, Biden won support from Representative Veronica Escobar, Mayor Steve Adler of Austin, and other state and local elected officials.Though Bernie Sanders is set to win California, there is little evidence that he is improving on his 2016 performanceThis late movement towards Biden clearly made an impact: so far, Biden has won the primaries in Alabama, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia. Exit polls show that many Democratic voters made up their minds very late in the game: according to CNN, 49 per cent of Virginia\u0027s primary voters made up their minds in the past few days, for instance, and almost a third did the same in North Carolina. In Minnesota, 55 per cent decided in the last few days Biden\u0027s win there demonstrates the impact of Klobuchar\u0027s endorsement in her home state.African-American votes were key to many of Biden\u0027s victories.  In Alabama, 44 per cent of the Democratic primary electorate was black 72 per cent of these voters supported Biden. In Virginia, black voters comprised 27 per cent of the primary electorate, and 71 per cent of them supported Biden. He won 57 per cent of the black vote in North Carolina and 62 per cent in Tennessee.Though she remains bullish, this could be the end of the road for Elizabeth WarrenBut Biden also showed strength in states such as Minnesota and Oklahoma, where the electorate is overwhelmingly white and where Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. Even in Sanders\u0027s home state of Vermont, Biden appears likely to clear the 15 per cent threshold to earn delegates in 2016, Sanders won all of Vermont\u0027s delegates. Sanders also won primaries in Utah and Colorado. But with four candidates meeting the threshold for delegates in Colorado, Sanders will not have the sort of edge he needs to make up for Biden\u0027s big wins elsewhere for that he must rely on an expected win in California. But that state\u0027s lengthy vote count means that we will not know how that translates into delegates for quite some time. In addition, Sanders\u0027s performance throughout the primary season has shown little indication that he is capable of delivering new voters in the sorts of numbers that might have made skittish Democratic leaders more open to him as their nominee. Instead, his support in 2020 appears to be about what it was four years ago. Nor has he shown much desire to expand his support to include other segments of the Democratic primary electorate.Meanwhile, Mike Bloomberg\u0027s attempt to do an end-run around the four early primary states and launch a candidacy on Super Tuesday has fizzled it appears that the former New York mayor has won only a handful of delegates, and won only in American Samoa\u0027s contest.Mike Bloomberg has spent a lot of money but only has victory in American Samoa to show for itSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is trailing in her home state\u0027s primary but has shown little sign that she is considering ending her campaign.Even with results still to come from California, and with contests in Maine and Texas too close to call, this has been a remarkable night for Joe Biden and his campaign.Christopher J.

They could pay statutory minimum sick pay or anything up to full wages for several months.Greggs will pay workers who self isolate due to coronavirusEmployment dispute resolution service Acas says employers must resolve workers\u0027 genuine concerns about the virus. This could mean offering flexible working for example.If an employee still does not want to go in, they may be able to arrange with to take the time off as holiday or unpaid leave but the\u0026nbspemployer does not have to agree to this.If an employee refuses to attend work, it could result in disciplinary action.You are entitled to time off if you\u0026nbsphave a dependent who needs you in an emergency,\u0026nbspfor example if your child’s school is closed or they are sick and you need to look after them.\u0026nbspNumber of weeks you may have to wait to claim Universal Credit if you are out of workThe amount of time off must be “reasonable” and there is no statutory right to pay for this.

Insurance policies for accident, illness and unemployment may cover wages lost to coronavirus infection.Sickness cover is unlikely to cover the cost of self-isolation or loss of earnings if work dries up because people are staying home in response to the virus.If you have this kind of protection policy, check what cover you have with your insurer.Uber’s “partner protection” policy, for example covers severe sickness and injury if a medical practitioner signs a driver off for over seven days. From day eight, drivers are eligible for a daily payment for up to 15 days.Work and pensions minister, Justin Tomlinson, attracted criticism when he suggested people rely on benefits if they could not work during the outbreak.“Those whose employers ask them to stay away from the workplace due to coronavirus concerns, who do not qualify for Statutory Sick Pay, may be able to claim Universal Credit andor new-style employment and support allowance,” he said.Universal Credit claimants have to wait up to five weeks for their first payment, however. Given that the government forecasts up to one fifth of the workforce is forecast to be off sick meaning that a significant number of people could struggle to make ends meet.People with no sick pay who may not be able to afford two weeks of self-isolationAlternatively, workers who are unable to work because of a health condition can claim employment and support allowance but only if they have paid National Insurance for the last two to three years.\u0026nbspThe rate for the first 13 weeks is up to £57.90 per week if your aged under 25 or up to £73.10 for over-25s. It then rises to as much as £111.65 depending on inidual circumstances.A spokesperson for the UK government’s Department for Work and Pensions said: “Our staff are ready to support people if they are affected – we urge them to contact us by phone, or their work coach via their online journal, to explain their situation.If people have to stay home on less than full pay, more people will get into debt. The Money and Pensions Service estimates that 16.7 million people are struggling or squeezed, and these may be particularly unlikely to have financial resilience to get through a period of reduced income.\u0026nbsp“It often only takes one knock to income to push people into problem debt,\u0026nbspsays Sue Anderson, of StepChange debt charity.“Once the immediate threat of coronavirus does pass, it really must be a long term policy goal to improve financial resilience and the way that the welfare system works so that more people are better able to weather short-term financial shocks without being tipped into problem debt.”Further advice on managing debt is available on StepChange’s website:\u0026nbsphttps:www.stepchange.orgShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The earth is slowly moving\u0026nbspMore trouble at the mill for Barclays.\u0026nbspAhead of the bank’s AGM, Jupiter Asset Management, one of its top 25 shareholders, has announced that it plans to back a shareholder resolution calling on the bank to phase out providing financial services such as lending to fossil fuel companies and utilities that fail to align with goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree Barclays bankers cleared of £4bn crisis deal with QatarBarclays should call time on golden hellos as it seeks a new CEO Jupiter is fairly middle of the road when it comes to UK fund managers.\u0026nbspIt’s not a corporate governance stick in the mud. It will use its voting power and take stances. But it’s not an ethical investment boutique and nor would you group it with, say, a Hermes, or one of the other more cutting edge institutional investors on the subject of climate change.It wasn’t one of the 11 big investors that signed up to the resolution at the outset, when campaigning group ShareAction was shaking the trees and looking for supporters, either.\u0026nbspIts decision to offer its support now is thus significant, all the more so because the resolution isn’t one of those wooly ones that call for more disclosure. It demands that Barclays takes concrete action to change its business.\u0026nbspThis could be seen as further evidence of the way the ground is shifting in the investment community.\u0026nbspFund managers are increasingly seeing climate change as a business risk, one that will hurt them\u0026nbspby wreaking economic damage and crimping returns. They are starting to\u0026nbsptake\u0026nbspit very seriously and are thus demanding that investee companies take it very seriously.Resolutions like this one rarely win, although sooner or later the dam\u0026nbspwill break.Even if it doesn’t this time, a significant vote in favour will still send a powerful message to Barclays’ board, which has come up with the usual guff about listening to shareholders in response to the move, and whomever is appointed to fill the roll of chief executive when Jes Staley departs.\u0026nbspBehind the scenes, the bank has quietly argued that it should be compared with a US, rather than a European peer group, because\u0026nbspit is a transatlantic investment bank.\u0026nbspThat won’t wash. It simply says, look, our peer group is ok with mucking up the planet so you should let us carry on too. Its a specious and short term argument.\u0026nbspThe bank also needs to wake up to the fact that while European money managers are ahead of the curve when it comes to the climate crisis, there have been tentative signs that American ones are belatedly starting to wake up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The tests simulate a range of potential shocks, including\u0026nbspa dramatic economic slowdown in China and Hong Kong. The Chinese economy has been impacted significantly by the virus with factories shut down and planes grounded, delivering a knock-on effect for companies that source goods and materials from China.“We don’t know what’s going to happen,” Mr Carney said. “Certainly the situation we are entering, the economic situation we are entering because of the virus – we didn’t run a stress test against that specific situation but we can learn from the stress tests we’ve been carrying out since 2014 about the resilience of the institutions against that type of risk.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don’t have any zero contract hours,” he told the BBC.Wetherspoons said last week that its 45,000 employees would be paid statutory sick pay if they isolate themselves.

Basically, how do you tell if the feedback is real or someone trying to manipulate the system? Or probably real or probably trying to manipulate the system,” Musk said.“Some way to differentiate between, this is a real person and this is someone just trying to manipulate the system. I see people trying to sway public opinion, and sometimes it can be difficult to figure out what’s real public opinion and what’s not.”Reports of Elliott Management’s investment emerged just days after Twitter announced new measures to tackle misinformation on the platform.A spokesperson for Elliott Management had no comment on the reports and Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But others didn\u0027t – meaning that users might be happily navigating around their various apps, before being hit by the shocking white of WhatsApp or any other app that had so far failed to add its own dark mode.WhatsApp group chats can be found on GoogleNow users that are using the latest versions of Google or Apple\u0027s operating system – Android 10 or iOS 13 – will be able to switch the mode on from their phone\u0027s settings.Dark mode for\u0026nbspWhatsApp\u0026nbspoffers a fresh look on a familiar experience, the company said in a blog post.It\u0027s designed to reduce eye strain in low light environments. And we hope it helps prevent those awkward moments where your phone lights up the room.It also said that the change should make the app easier to read, by highlighting only the most important content.WhatsApp made a special video – titled Hello Darkness and including a previously unreleased version of The Sound of Silence by Paul Simon – to celebrate the launch of the feature.For users who have WhatsApp and their operating system updated to the latest version, enabling the mode should be as easy as switching on dark mode in settings. Users on Android 9 or earlier can switch on the theme in WhatsApp specifically, by heading to the settings, selecting chats and then picking the dark theme.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The New York Times ran op-eds\u0026nbsppraising his time as mayor of New York City (even as he was bashed on the campaign trail — and by that newspaper itself — for the highly contentious policies like stop-and-frisk\u0026nbsphe championed that targeted black and brown men in the liberal city). Some pundits suggested having a guy who can throw billions down to beat Donald Trump might be the safest route forward. Polls showed him doing well across Super Tuesday states.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, in a country where money is often its own potent miracle-maker, Mr Biden managed to notch up wins in states he didn’t even visit ahead of the Tuesday votes, and after months in which his campaign struggled with fundraising and infrastructure. Super Tuesday turned a fractious race into one in which Mr Biden and Bernie Sanders are virtually the only two candidates with any shot at the nomination.Apparently you can’t use a virtually limitless fortune to just buy up adverts during the Super Bowl, field offices across the country, catered rallies and endorsements from local leaders whose causes you’ve underwritten, and then expect it to turn into wins. Well, unless you’re only gunning for American Samoa.As results were tallied Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning — showing Mr Biden winning at least eight of the 14 states, and Mr Sanders winning at least three — that\u0026nbspreality appeared to dawn on Mr Bloomberg as well.Warren loses home state to Joe BidenBiden set to win Virginia and Sanders to take Vermont on Super TuesdayReports indicated that he was planning on rethinking his campaign (translation: drop out?) on Wednesday,\u0026nbspeven as he claimed the over $500m\u0026nbsphe spent had helped his campaign to accomplish the impossible.“As the results come in, here’s what is clear: No matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one else thought was possible. In just three months we’ve gone from 1 per cent in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination for president,” Mr Bloomberg told cheering staff and supporters.But the businessman’s definition of defying the possible has cost him big. For 2020 candidates in general, including Mr\u0026nbspTrump, Mr Bloomberg has spent the most, pulling from his vast personal fortune.The biggest loser tonight, by far, is Mini Mike Bloomberg. His \u0027political\u0027\u0026nbspconsultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain, and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike, and the complete destruction of his reputation. Way to go Mike! tweeted Mr Trump on Tuesday evening.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Trump, in second, boasts having raised $218m. And beyond that, Mr Sanders has raised nearly $133m, making him the third highest fundraiser.Mr Biden, meanwhile, was fifth in fundraising, with just $68m\u0026nbspavailable to his campaign, according to the analysis — less than 17th the cash spent by Mr Bloomberg.Of course, that is all going to change for Mr Biden. Fundraisers are lining up to push him forward as he looks to take on Mr Sanders in what will undoubtedly be a long and vicious fight over the next few months.Instead of being the poor old vice president who maybe missed his chance, he’ll soon be the money-flushed candidate of the Democratic establishment.And, who knows, maybe if Mr Bloomberg ends his run he’ll throw the money he wanted to spend on his own race behind the freshly minted comeback kid of the 2020 race.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And so we must recognise that at this point in the race, the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideals is to step aside and help bring our party and our nation together, he said.

His campaign then quietly announced a detour to Indiana, where he confirmed his decision to step aside.In a statement earlier to The Independent, the campaign said that Mr Buttigieg believes this is the right thing to do for our country, for our party and for Americans across the country eager to heal our ided nation, defeat this president and work to fix our broken politics.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Is it conceivable under any circumstance, you try and cut off the city in this country ”Mr Hancock replied:  Theres clearly a huge economic and social downside to that.But we don’t take anything off the table at this stage, because you’ve got to make sure that you have all the tools available,that is what’s necessary.But I want to minimise the social and economic disruption.It may be too early to make such calls but the top priority is keeping the public safe, he said.And a vaccine is still months away from being developed.Ministers will this week look at emergency powers they might needthe virus continues to spread - to make sure Britain is fully prepared.Under the worst-case scenario, we would have to take quite signicant action, Mr Hancock told the BBC.We will be publishing battle plans this week that sets those things out.It came as:Health officials are desperate to trace those who were in touch with the man who had walked into a GP surgery in Haslemere,  Surrey.They have not found anything linking him to someone who had been to an affected region abroad.A doctor from the practice also has symptoms, ex-Health Secretary and local MP Jeremy Hunt said.A senior health source said: “This is our nightmare scenario. It’s spreading uncontrollably and we are losing our grip.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock this morning said the Government already were able to forcibly quarantine members of the populationthey were at risk.And thanks to large-scale No Deal planning in the past six months, the country already has stockpiles of several types of drug that could be usedneeded to try and treat the virus.He also cast into doubt the information coming from other countries such as China and Iran on coronavirus - amid fears they are suppressing the true number of people affected.We dont think all the figures from around the world are fully accurate, he said.We update [our] figures all the time... but we dont say any of those figures are concrete and definitive.The Health Secretary said today people should scrub their mitts for at least  seconds to destroy as many germs as possible.He told Radio  Live: You should do that for  seconds or more, and the way we explain it to children is that you should sing… wash your hands as long as you’re singing either Happy Birthday or God Save The Queen.Experts have warned that desperate moves to contain the Covid- outbreak could decimate all sport across the UK for months.Clubs yesterday began taking their own precautions to protect star players from infection.Tottenham’s injured South Korean ace Son Heung-min, , has been forced to self-isolate for two weeks after ing from his home country, where hundreds of cases have erupted.Last night the outbreak was casting a shadow over horse racing’s historic Cheltenham Festival, which begins in  days time.Organisers insist it is “full steam ahead” for the four-day meeting.But the odds of racing not taking place on the first day were a mere   last night.Cheltenham expects , spectators to attend the festival and the event in Gloucestershire will not take place without them.Rugby has already been hit by the postponement of next week’s Six Nations clash between Ireland and virus-plagued Italy.Englands football friendly against Italy at Wembley on Friday March  is still officially on — though it is subject to review.The Chinese Formula One Grand Prix scheduled for April  has been postponed, while other races are in doubt.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Others are on borrowed time.Casualties could yet include the biggest fish of all, Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill — Rutnam’s predecessor at the Home Office.If he survives, it will be at the cost of his second huge job as head of national security.Few of these shadowy Whitehall aristocrats will welcome Sir Calamity’s decision to wash their dirty linen in public.And with a career-long ­catalogue of costly blunders to his name, drama queen ­Rutnam could yet regret suing for unfair dismissal.Witnesses might testy to his “sneaky and snivelling” ­managerial style — including perhaps Amber Rudd, who blames him for destroying her career as a Cabinet high-flier.Rutnam left her to swing for his department’s unforgivable Windrush scandal and the deportation of innocent West Indian migrants.As Ms Rudd fell on her sword, Rutnam “went missing”.“She repeatedly asked for the information but it was never forthcoming,” says a friend.“Then a week after she resigned, the data was made available. The whole thing was very odd.”In other words, it stinks.Sir Philip had little time for Priti Patel.“He seemed to think Priti was stupid and treated her as such,” says an insider.Once exposed to daylight, such arrogance, coupled with third-party allegations of racism, can be politically explosive.We are witnessing a deceptively important battle on the home front, fought in parallel with Brexit.Downing Street believes it is winning the fight for ­sovereignty. But the mandarins are fighting a Fth Column battle to keep Britain tied to the EU’s apron strings.“The first six months are critical,” says a senior ­ministerial source. “It’s all to play for.”MILLIONAIRE lawyer “Sir” Keir Starmer QC – he pretends to hate the title – is now a racing certainty for Jeremy Corbyn’s job as Labour leader.This chameleon politician is a protege of Labour dud Gordon Brown. They remain close.It was Brown who made Starmer Director of Public Prosecutions, a post he disgraced by ­persecuting innocent journalists for publishing the truth.He was rewarded with his knighthood and one of ­Labour’s safest seats in posh Holborn and St Pancras, a stone’s throw from his Doughty Street Chambers.Labour is welcome to the cad. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

eastenders","story":"It feels like it’s been going at least  years, partly because it survives on just half a dozen endlessly repeated stories, but also due to the fact its shrill tone, right-on agenda and obsession with long-suffering, alcoholic women and spineless men has been copied by almost every other mainstream drama on TV.Take, for instance, last night, where you had the choice of ITV’s Liar or BBC’s The Split.Such a miserable offering, I flipped a coin, lost and ended up watching The Split.If you haven’t suffered like I have, I should explain this is basically just a middle-class version of EastEnders set in a family law firm run by matriarch Ruth and her daughters, who are straight from central soap casting.There’s Nina, the hot one, an alcoholic shoplter who can’t get a bloke.And there’s Hannah, who’s as plain as an envelope and has men fighting over her in the street.There is another one as well, Rose, who can’t get pregnant.But writer Abi Morgan hasn’t the ­faintest idea what to do with her, so the drama tends to revolve around the ­miserable-as-sin Hannah, played by Nicola Walker, who’s been having the least steamy affair in television history with a walking Grolsch advert called Christie Carmichael.They bonded over a mutual love of swimming and legal jargon and now refer to their encounters as “Grayling,” like it was a Prohibited Steps Order.He’s a bit of a git, obviously. As is pretty much everyone  on The Split.The only other ones you really need bother about, though, are the firm’s dandyish boss Zander, whose spirit animal is Rupert The Bear.His partner, Tyler, who “specialises in mergers”, which I think is meant to sound sexy.And Hannah’s unfaithful husband Nathan, played by Stephen Mangan, who’s thinking of getting it on with an office junior called Chloe who is not just the authentic voice of The Split but the entire BBC.“I heard you speak at the Women In Law lunch,” she says, less than enticingly, at one point.“Feminist perspectives on cross-examination. It was great.”Yeah, it sounds like a total riot.You feel for the actors, obviously. They’re constrained not just by the script and the EastEnders rules of drama, but by the subject matter as well.In Walford, they at least have a small choice of storylines.Here, there’s just one. Divorce, orce and more orce.A slightly more savvy drama department would’ve given up on it after one series.The Beeb just ploughs on, though, trying to jolly it along with some insanely annoying incidental music and a couple of guest stars.This series, they’ve gone for broke and landed Donna Air off Byker Grove, who spends the duration of her screen time, as TV presenter Fi Hansen, looking like she’s got a particularly bad smell under her nose.She thinks its disdain for her controlling screen husband, Richie.We all know it looks more like contempt for the show, the plot and the script, which forces poor Nicola Walker to scream: “You have s**t, Nina.We all have s**t.” And there’s another two weeks of this s**t to go.Avoid avoid avoid.MEANWHILE, on Liar, Laura Nielson: “I don’t know how Andrew Earlham died and I don’t care.”Snap.SHE’S McDonald, he’s Dodds. So together they are . . .A right pain in the ar*e.Tala Gouveia is ambitious, no-nonsense DCI Lauren McDonald, who’s come down to Bath, from London, saying things like: “I’m here for two years, tops. Don’t get attached to me.”I won’t.DS Dodds is her dorkish, time-serving partner, played by Jason Watkins, with a non-specic Yokel accent.It could be Bath, it could be Ba’ath Party. The damn thing comes and goes, like the ad breaks, so it’s really hard to tell.Bog-standard Sunday night brain rot, so far.The real trouble here, though, is that as well as a lousy script and bonkers plot, McDonald  Dodds writer Robert Murphy has got a very PC political axe, which he grinds against multi-millionaire entrepreneur Max Crockett , who bears no physical resemblance to the Prime Minister.However, he has got a surprisingly large number of children, a much younger pregnant we and a way of quivering with rage about “the politics of envy” that leaves you in no doubt where all of Murphy’s prejudices lie.The normal rules of quality drama and all the most self-important catch-up viewers dictate that spoilers are absolutely forbidden on a whodunnit.So I’ve got no hesitation telling you it was Kasha, the lesbian, traveller waitress, who shot Max’s secret son, Seth.Begone, McDonald  Dodds.

As long as you wash your hands, shaking hands is OK.The end of handshaking is not something the scientists are recommending.Thousands of deaths could be on the cards, it is feared.A senior government source said: “If we do end up in the scenario where this is a full epidemic, steps will have to be taken that mean le can’t carry on quite as it does now.“And we will have to make some changes to ensure that we are doing everything we can to protect the public and delay the full onset of this virus.”Yesterday the PM said it was highly likely the virus would sp widely in the coming days and weeks.He added: We have agreed a plan... but we can all continue to do our bit to fight this virus — by washing our hands with soap and water for theof time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice.A pupil at Churston Ferrers Grammar School in Torbay, Devon, became Britain’s first confirmed child case.

with or without a mask.There is no need for mass stockpiling of food or other goods but medics have suggested it could be wise to keep some essentials handy in case of the need for self-isolation.Ian Mackay, virologist at the University of Queensland, Australia, said buying extra long-lasting foods such as cereals, pasta, fruit and tinned fish could help those told to stay indoors.Matt Hancock and other health has said he hopes not to have to bring in emergency legislation to cancel large events and has urged schools and businesses to follow official advice before any shutdown.He said: Right now, we do not recommend the cancelling of mass events and schools as well should not be closing unless there is a positive case and the schools have the advice to close.There maybe things we have to do down the line that we dont want to, but we will need the powers to do that hence proposing emergency legislation.People are also urged to use the NHS  service and only attend hospital in case of an emergency as the health service comes under increasing strain.For the majority of people coronavirus will be best treated through self-isolation and over the counter medicines.If you have to self-isolate at home, your firm should let you take that time as sick pay.Your employer can choose to pay you your full salary while youre off sick but the statutory minimum entitlement is currently £. per week.Statutory Sick Payonly kicks inyou work for an employer, are sick for at least four days in a row and earn on average at least £ per week .These rules still applyyou are working on a part-time or fixed-term contract.If you cant get sick pay, you may be able to negotiate working from home during this time so your pay isnt affected.Its worth checking with your employer what their policy is as some may require you to provide a letter from a doctor after five days.No said today that firms should not tell their employees to get a sick note from their doctors.People who are not entitled to sick leave include people who are self-employed, members of the armed forces, those who have received Employment and Support Allowance in the past three months, people in legal custody or those who have already received SSP for  weeks.Workers on zero-hour contracts are entitled to SSP too, as long as theyve done some work for the company and been ill for at least four days in a row, including their days off.Although its not officially advice, it makes sense to try and keep your commutes as safe and effective as possible.If you have the option of not taking public transport, your company may ask you to consider that instead.If you do have to use public transport, extra personal distancing from your fellow commuterswould be sensible, and washing your hands after you get off the tube cant hurt either.The UKs battle plan to tackle coronavirus was revealed by Boris Johnson today as the country prepares for the illness to spread.The number of people in the UK who have tested positive for the virus stands at .UK cases include a worker at the North East London NHS Foundation Trust offices at Vinters Business Park near Maidstone in Kent, a pupil from Churston Ferrers grammar school in Torbay, a teacher at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and the parent of a pupil at a school in Stevenage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Number two: practical.Theyre necessary becauseyoure The Queen, youre shaking a lot of hands - so they protect her hands as well.Cornelia James received a Royal Warrant in  to become the official glove manufacturer to the Queen - since she passed away in , her daughter Genevieve has taken over the family business.Boris Johnson today released his battle plan to kill off the deadly bug in Britain, including sweeping measures considered including shutting down schools, banning mass gatherings,  cancelling NHS operations and encouraging people to work from home.It comes after videos of members of the public tapping their feet together as a greeting instead have gone viral online.Mr Hancock told the BBC earlier: The advice is the impact of shaking hands is negligible. As long as you wash your hands, shaking hands is OK.The end of handshaking is not something the scientists are recommending.Up to one in five could be off work sick during the peak of the crisis, it was predicted today.And health officials admitted the elderly and those with underlying health conditions were most at risk as the virus continues to spread across the UK.Speaking today, Prof Jon Cohen, Emeritus Professor of Infectious Diseases, Brighton  Sussex Medical School, said: It’s not surprising that older people, and especially those with pre-existing or underlying conditions, have more complications and a higher case fatality rate.This is in part because they have less ‘reserve’ to cope with the stress of an infection, and partly because natural immunity wanes as we get older.As a specic example, coronavirus causes a respiratory illness and this places greater stress on the heart, so people with pre-existing heart disease will find it harder to deal with a serious respiratory infection.This is not something that is limited to coronavirus infection – the same principle applies to all types of respiratory infections.”Meanwhile, experts have warned gloves wont necessarily protect against coronavirus.Instead, gloves are one of the worst culprits for this since you will be touching everything you would normally touch with your hands and you probably wont think about cleaning them before, for example, touching your face.And when your hands get hot and sweaty inside, it creates an even better environment for microbes to grow.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The doomsday document warns Brits could see more troops on the streets, sports matches and schools closed and police forced to abandon low-level crime to maintain public order. A fth of Brits could be off sick at once, an army of NHS staff could be pulled out of retirement and people turfed out of hospitals early - not to mention a dilemma for councils in dealing with more bodies. The pressures on services and wider society may start to become signicant and clearly noticeable, the document says. And even more than one in five could be off worktheyaposre caring for the sick. At a Downing Street press conference, Boris Johnson insisted our country remains extremely well prepared. He said the Army could be called inneeded and sick pay rules would be kept under review. But Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned up to % of Brits could be infected, % of whom die - though he stressed it would probably be a lot lower than that.  Prof Whitty added: Even for the highest-risk group, the great majority of people will survive this. Soyou look at the Chinese data,you take the very oldest people, the great majority survive. So it is important to stress that. Andyouaposre talking about the low-risk groups the rate of mortality is well below %. So I think thereaposs always a danger people think this has actually got a higher risk than it actually has for them personally.A Downing Street press conference heard whole-city lockdowns like in China are unlikely - and there was “no need” to panic-buy goods, which could make the situation worse. But Boris Johnson admitted: There are long established plans by which the police will keep the public safe, prioritise those things they have to do. The Army is of course always ready to backfill as and when. But that is under the reasonable worst case scenario.  Meanwhile the government will consider passing new lawsnecessary to help public authorities cope - while the services we rely on may be reduced temporarily. And Health Secretary Matt Hancock is thought to have spoken to chiefs at social media firms, including Twitter, urging them to help the responsible spread of accurate information about the outbreak. Now remember, this is only a potential plan for later stages of the outbreak - which the government doesnapost expect for weeks or even months,it happens in the UK. But bearing that in mind, what exactly does it say  Hereaposs a guide to  key points. . Remember! For now, the advice is pretty much what you know already  Itaposs important to stress that the governmentaposs plan has four stages - contain, delay, research, mitigate. Currently we are still on Stage One, and the plan accounts for all four stages over a period of several months. For now, the public health advice is much simpler than most of whataposs in the document:Follow public health advice on hand washing -  seconds with hot water and soap Rely only on trusted sources of information such as the government and NHS websites Check and follow the latest Foreign Office travel advice Check your family’s vaccinations for other conditions are up to date Check on elderly or vulnerable family, friends and neighbours Use NHS , pharmacies and GPsand only go to AE when really needed Go into self-isolationyou are advised to by the NHS, but not otherwiseAuthorities already have the legal power to “detain and direct” people in quarantined areas, and apply for court orders to force people to undergo quarantine and medical examination” - under emergency laws passed in the last few weeks. Itaposs thought the main way the virus is transmitted isyouaposre standing less than  metres from someone who sneezes, for example. Oryou touch a surface that has droplets from a cough or sneeze, and then touch your face. Thataposs why handwashing is so important.  The reason the plan has been drawn up is because, as it admits, “it may be that widespread exposure in the UK is inevitable. Weaposre all susceptible to catching the disease”, because thereaposs no vaccine and no natural immunity in our bodies yet. Officials believe the containment phase is almost over and whataposs more, the course of the disease cannot be predicted accurately at this point”. The strategy is to delay the peak of the outbreak as much as possible until the summer, when the NHS is under less strain from other illnesses like flu. That also “buys time for the testing of drugs and initial development of vaccines, the plan says. If we do reach the third and particularly the fourth stages of the outbreak - hereaposs what might happen. Andwidespread exposure happens... . Gatherings like football matches may be banned  The plan confirms that large gatherings, like sports matches or the London Marathon, could be banned. It says: “Action that would be considered could include population distancing strategiesto slow the spread of the disease throughout the population, whilst ensuring the country’s ability to continue to run as normally as possible. However, there is no information currently about which events might be banned, for how long, or with how much notice - because itaposs simply too early to tell. The plan says: “Such judgements will be informed based on the best available and and most up-to-date scientic evidence and taken into account the trade-offs involved.” By apostrade-offsapos, the government is talking about the hit to the economy and public order. When it comes to sports matches, itaposs thought the risk could be higher from cramming into the pub afterwards than the actual match. Thataposs because itaposs thought the virus can only usually be transmitted in close proximity. Pensioners could be advised to stay away from big public gatherings like the VE Day celebrations. The plan makes clear troops could be used to support public bodies like the NHS and councils. It says: The Ministry of Defence has put in place plans to ensure the deliver of its key operations in the UK and overseas. There are also well-practised arrangements for Defence to provide support to Civil Authoritiesrequired. . A fth of all Brits could be off work at once  The plan admits everyone will face increased pressures at work, not to mention caring for themselves and others who might have the virus. It states: In a stretching scenario, it is possible that up to one fth of employees may be absent from work during peak weeks. This may y for inidual businesses. There will be case-by-case mitigation for small firms unable to pay their taxes or other duties due to cash flow issues. This will be run through HMRCaposs Time to Pay system. . Police could have to abandon low-level crime  Police and firefighters would be among the hardest-hita fth of Brits end up off work. The plan says they will “enact business continuity plans to ensure they are able to maintain a level of service that fulfils their critical s. For example, with a signicant loss of officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order.” . Councils face dealing with more bodies in makesht morgues  The plan does not explicitly refer to bodies and morgues but it makes reference to them obliquely. It says: “There could well be an increase in deaths arising from the outbreak, particularly amongst vulnerable and elderly groups.” Councils are to be given advice by central government on “dealing with this challenge”, it adds. Councils are the organisations responsible for dealing with death registrations, morgues and inquests - and inquests already have a very long waiting time, taking months or even years to complete. . Patients could be turfed out of hospitals early.. with doctors brought out of retirement  If there is a serious outbreak, health and social care bodies would be asked to work together to support early discharge from hospital and to look after people in their own homes, the plan says. Patients could also be turned away from hospitalthey have low-level conditions and routine operations could be postponed. The plan saysdoctors and nurses themselves become ill in large numbers, NHS hospitals may recommend a signicantly dferent approach to admissions. That would see staff re-deployed to prioritise and triage service delivery. The pressures on the NHS - especiallydoctors and nurses become sick - could force people whoaposve left or retired from the NHS to come back. Staff rostering changes may be necessary, including calling leavers and retirees back to duty, the plan says. . We could use emergency laws to enforce testing at the border Border force officers will be able to enforce testing for coronavirus at the UKaposs borders under the plans.Public health officials are already at international ports and airports but have not been able to insist on swabbing.Among the new emergency measures being drafted include giving them the right to test overseas visitors.. Schools could be closed  The clear advice is that schools should not close unless specically directed to by Public Health England. That advice would continue, but it may well be that more schools are told to close by the authorities. The governmentsapos education departmentsapos planning assumptions include the possibility of of having to close educational settings in order to reduce the spread of infection, the plan adds.  . People could have to work more from home As stated above , workplaces could count as large-scale gatherings and need to send people home. However, the plan suggests this would be encouraged rather than enforced , and obviously there are some professions where itaposs not possible. . Contact tracing could have to be abandoned  At the moment health authorities are piling huge resources into painstakingly tracing every person that an infected patient came into contact with. However, as the virus spreads this may become impossible, or a bad use of resources that could be used to treat the sick. The plan says contact tracing “may lose effectiveness” and officials may need to direct their resources where in future. The Chief Medical Officer said there may come a point where it’s “so great” that containment “ceases to make sense”. He added: “We have not reached that point, but we could reach that point.” . Medicine stockpiles would start being depleted  The UK “maintains strategic stockpiles of the most important medicines and protective equipment” for healthcare staff, the plan says. “These stocks are being monitored daily, with additional stock being ordered where necessary”. However, the plan says the UK may need to draw down on stockpiles of medicines and medical devices in the case of a widespread outbreak. There are no numbers of estimates of how quickly this might happen. . And there could yet be ‘multiple waves’ of the illness It may not be a simple case of one peak, the plan says - and a more long term plan may be needed. “It is possible that an outbreak or pandemic of COVID- could occur in multiple waves”, it says. . But despite it all, the government says weaposre well-placed to deal with it These are all doomsday plans, of course. But the government is also trying to reassure people. The plan says the government has “planned extensively over the years for an event like this, and the UK is therefore well prepared to respond in a way that offers substantial protection to the public.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how uks coronavirus sick pay","story":"NewsHow UKs coronavirus sick pay laws compare to the rest of EuropeGovernment advice is thatyou have come into contact with someone who may be infected you should self-isolate for a period of two weeks or until given the all-clear.

Government advice is thatyou have come into contact with someone who may be infected you should self-isolate for a period of two weeks or until given the all-clear. But trade union Prospect, professionals including engineers, scientists, managers and civil servants, are warning that many sick pay policies in the UK wonapost cover situations where staff are forced to take two weeks off work, despite the government asking them to pay. The only guarantee is that workers will be entitled to be Statutory Sick Pay. But this does not cover the first three days of absence and is capped at £. per week.  Prospect has also uncovered that many insurance policies for freelancers do not cover self-isolation. This means that many people are faced with the impossible choice of either following the government’s advice or getting paid.Workers affected by coronavirus who are not eligible for sick pay may be able to claim Universal Credit , according to Business Secretary Alok Sharma.But, according to their research, in many other European countries, this is not the case, with the government’s being proactive in their support for workers. Prospect are asking is asking for the government to compel businesses to cover pay when employees are affected by COVID- or have to self-isolate and to lobby insurance companies for them to cover self-isolation. They have also asked ministers to establish a system to cover any lost earnings due to self-isolation that are not covered by insurance or by employers and to support businesses who cannot afford to provide this enhanced cover.  Rules for workers around EuropeFinland – workers receive benefits equivalent to full pay from day one of isolation. France – the French government changed the law a month ago to make it clear to employers than anyone who was self-isolating under government advice qualies for sick leave in the same way as anyone who is ill. Netherlands – The government say employers cannot oblige workers to use holiday leavethey are in isolation and must continue to pay them as normal. Sweden – it is an employers’ responsibility not only to minimise the spread of any infection, andthey ask an employee to self-isolate they must pay them whether or not they can carry out work. Spain - a salaried employee who is self-isolating under the advice of authorities will be entitled to the same sick leave cover as they would usually get – regardless of whether they are in fact ever diagnosed with the coronavirus.Prospect General Secretary Mike Clancy said: “The UK is lagging well behind its European neighbours in providing a sensible system of provisions for workers doing the right thing in responding to the threat from COVID-.“Countries like France, the Netherlands and Sweden already have clear and fair systems in place so that nobody doing their civic duty will be out of pocket. The UK government has so far refused to confirm what,anything, it will do in these circumstances. “Workers need clarity from their employers thatthey self-isolate they will not lose out,they don’t give it then the government must compel them. Similarly, businesses need clarity from the government on their responsibilities and on how they will be supported. “If the government, workers and business work together we can deal with this problem without it becoming a full-blown crisis.”Last week, Labour had called on the Government to ensure that the employment rights of workers on zero hour contracts who are self-isolating should be protected."},{"url":null,"title":"joe bidens super tuesday comeback","story":"NewsopinionJoe Bidens Super Tuesday comeback shows Democrats are thinking about TrumpJoe Biden woke up this morning after an unexpectedly good night in the  Primary - Super TuesdayShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsopinion \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

It seems the apparent ability to give President Trump a proper fight was a key reason US Democrats voted for Joe. The early exit polls suggested the ability to defeat Trump was more of a factor in people’s decision than whether the person they voted for shared their views on the issues. That’s quite an extraordinary statement on how hated Donald Trump is in much of America. For all of the packed rallies and bluster about his being a man of the people, for the vast majority of his time in office Trump has enjoyed the worst approval ratings of any sitting President since records began. And in his only electoral test since he set up camp in the Oval Office, ’s midterm elections, he got a bruising. For America’s enormous middle-class, the choice is between an avuncular father-figure, who evokes feelings of warmth and safety despite occasionally forgetting to finish his sentences and a spiky, energeticfigure who promises a full on revolution. Elsewhere in the race, Elizabeth Warren, who seems perfectly competent, but only scraped third place in her own home state last night - remains on the ballot. But the  million Michael Bloomberg spent on advertising in the run up to Super Tuesday now looks like the biggest waste of money since the tuition fees at Trump University. At the time of writing the billionaire media mogul was “considering the future” of his campaign - and was determined not to be the guy who “helped Sanders become the nominee”. For now, presented with the risk of another four years of Donald Trump, it looks Democrats in Super Tuesday states have decided not to let the great be the enemy of the good. But there’s still a long way to go in the primary election - and it could still culminate in a bitter, messy floor-fight at the Democratic convention where the final winner will be decided.

He revealed a number of fresh donations when the parliamentary register was published today. But the frontrunner is being accused of delaying the publication of thousands of pounds in donations to his campaign after his competitors voluntarily published the names of those who had given money. Thataposs because he has chosen to follow the the usual rules for MPs by relying on the register of members’ financial interests - as agreed by Labouraposs ruling NEC for the contest. It means donors only have to be named  days after they have donated raising concerns that many members will have voted by the time all the donations have been published.The shadow Brexit secretary’s major donations come from Robert Latham, a Camden Labour activist and barrister who practised at Doughty Street Chambers – like Starmer who has handed over £,.Smaller donations of £, and £, have come from Richard Hermer and Iain Simpson. The campaign has also benefited from £, worth of hotel stays kind from a firm led by Farah Sassoon whose firm provides the hotel rooms for Labour Party conference and who was once dubbed ‘Sally Bercow’s drinking pal’. The parliamentary system means a donation only needs to be published  days after it has been received. The only cash donations he declared today were accepted on January  and declared on February  -   days later. Any donations Keir Starmer received after Feb rd didn’t have to be declared today.  Her latest donations show Rebecca Long-Bailey has declared £, from Unite, a further £, from the union to cover a seconded staff member and £, for a ‘digital media consultant’. While the Momentum campaign group has given £, worth of staff time. The figures dwarf the declarations made by the other campaigns. Long-Bailey’s team say delays will mean most members have voted by the time funding is fully disclosed.  Shadow cabinet secretary Jon Trickett, who is supporting Long-Bailey and sits on the NEC, said: “By only publishing donations via the register, candidates can self-finance in order to delay accepting donations, allowing them to publish these later on. You don’t have to officially accept a donation for  days and then you don’t have to declare it for another  days, so it can be  days until it’s declared on the register, which will be after the leadership election is over.

In a surprisingly strong showing, former vice-president Biden rolled to victories across the South, Midwest and New England on the biggest day of voting in the Democratic campaign. Sanders, who was way out in front coming into the crucial day of voting, was leading in the biggest race in Calornia at the time of publication, setting up a one-on-one battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. However Biden looks set to secure the second-biggest state of Texas and is now the bookies favourite to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump later this year. Last night Americans in  states were casting ballots to decide who should challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the November  general election . For those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign, said Biden. Barack Obamaaposs deputy had performed poorly in the first three nominating contests, but broke through with a win in South Carolina last week. We are very much alive, he told roaring supporters in Los Angeles. Sanders, the one-time front-runner who had hoped to take a big step toward the nomination on Tuesday, won Colorado, Utah and his home state of Vermont, Edison Research said. Fox News and AP projected Sanders won Calornia, whose  delegates represent the largest haul in the nominating contest. But Edison Research and other networks held off declaring a winner as results trickled in. With overwhelming support from African American, moderate and older voters, Biden swept to wins in Alabama, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. Early on Wednesday Texas, the state ing the second number of delegates - who eventually chose the nominee - was declared for Biden. Maine remained too close to call however.  It was a spectacular turn of events for Biden, whose campaign was on le support after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire. Until a week ago he trailed Sanders in most state and national polls. Bidenaposs blowout win in South Carolina on Saturday provided a burst of new momentum, fueling a wave of endorsements from elected Democratic officials and former presidential rivals including Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor, and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota .  The results also left Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who spent more than half a billion dollars on advertising, largely out of the running. His only victory came in the US territory of American Samoa. Bloomberg campaign officials said he would reassess whether to stay in the race on Wednesday, but they said that did not mean he would drop out. Biden was hoping to stay within reach of Sanders in delegates, giving him a chance to catch up as the race moved on. But after Tuesday, Biden leads Sanders in delegates  to .  Without naming him, Sanders took direct aim at Biden during a rally with supporters in Vermont. He criticized his  vote to authorize the war in Iraq and his support for global trade deals that Sanders opposed. Weaposre going to win the Democratic nomination and we are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country, Sanders said. Biden repeated his strong performance with black voters in South Carolina on Saturday.  Edison Research exit polls showed Biden winning large majorities of African-American voters in the South. He also won strong support from older people, college graduates and those who considered themselves liberal or moderate. Sanders countered with a strong showing among Latinos, young people and white men, helping him to wins in the West. The results were disappointing for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who finished well behind Sanders and Biden in most states and trailed them even in her home state of Massachusetts.  Bloomberg, who was on the ballot for the first time yesterday having entered the contest late, won some delegates, in Tennessee, Texas, Colorado, Utah, Calornia and Arkansas by picking up more than % of the vote. The billionaire skipped the first four contests and bombarded Super Tuesday and later voting states with ads. However, his poll numbers slipped after he came under fire during Democratic debates over past comments criticized as sexist. That effort gained fresh momentum on the eve of Tuesdayaposs voting as moderates Buttigieg and Klobuchar endorsed Biden after withdrawing from the race.

Super Tuesday is the biggest night in the Primary season, where Americans get to decide who will represent their party in Novemberaposs general election . And the race to be the Democrat nominee in  is full of big characters and arguments over the future of the party. With more than a dozen states set to pick their winners on one night, the course of the entire election could change. Hereaposs everything you need to know about Super Tuesday and the state of the US election campaign.What is Super Tuesday  Super Tuesday is - as its name suggests - the biggest night of the US primary campaign. After a series of one-off primary elections in states like Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada - Tuesday night some  states and one overseas territory will go to the polls to decide on their preferred candidates for the general election. Which states are involved Alabama American SamoaArkansas Calornia Colorado Maine Massachusetts Minnesota North Carolina Oklahoma Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont VirginiaWhen will the results be in  Polls close between pm and .pm Eastern Time, which is between midnight and .am our time. American Samoa is holding a caucus, which is weird and complicated, so itaposs likely to be quite late before results come in - so while results will be dropping in throughout the night, we might not have all the numbers until  or am.  How does the primary process work  Primaries and caucuses  Before each general election, the major parties pick a candidate to run for President. This is done through an excruciatingly long process of primary elections and caucuses, which can last twice as long as the election campaign itself. Party members in each of the  states plus the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the American Virgin Islands and Guam vote for their favoured candidate in either a primary election - a regular apossecret ballotapos style election held across the state - or a caucus, where party members express their preferences more publicly in school halls and community centres. On Super Tuesday, Alaska, Colorado, Minnesota and Wyoming are deciding their nominations with caucuses. Delegates Each state has a certain number of delegates at the partyaposs National Convention, decided by party based on the population of the state. These delegates are awarded to presidential candidates based either on a winner take all principle, or proportionally based on vote share. Superdelegates Just to make it even more confusing, there are a certain number of delegates from each state who can pledge to whichever candidate they like. They tend to be office holders, ex-presidents, members of congress, committee members and state chairs. The Conventions  The end of primary season, and the beginning of the election proper is marked by each partyaposs National Convention. These are similar to party conferences in this country, but on a much grander scale. The multi-day, stadium-sized events are filled with speeches from party grandees, congressmen and presidential candidates. The Conventions build up to an often dramatic floor vote, which decides which candidate the party will nominate for the presidential race. Why does Super Tuesday matter  Itaposs got the potential to make or break candidates for the presidency. Democratic candidates need  delegates to ensure a win, and a third of those are available on Super Tuesday. Which states are the most important  Texas and Calornia are the big ones. The lone star state has a whopping  delegates available for the Democrats. Calornia - taking part in Super Tuesday for the first time - has . Candidates will be playing for them in a big way.

Mr Packham said the review is “compromised, incomplete and flawed”.He said: “In the year of COP , it’s time for Boris Johnson to be held accountable. For now, we have won on Heathrow.The climate impact of HS is incompatible with any Net Zero Emissions target and will allow the large-scale expansion of airports instead of Heathrow. We must not allow HS to be Boris’ fast-track to expanding aviation where in the UK. “Our government has failed. I believe the review central to the mandate to proceed was seriously flawed in its methods. I believe that essential submissions regarding environmental concerns were ignored by the review . “As a consequence, the Oakervee review is compromised, incomplete and flawed and thus the decision to proceed based upon it is unlawful. “Today some of us are making a last stand for nature and the environment and we will not go quietly into any good night.” The Springwatch presenter believes that HS will damage or destroy almost  wildle sites, including over  Ancient Woodlands, and the climate impact of HS is expected to be incompatible with any Net Zero emissions target because the line will facilitate the large-scale expansion of airports across the UK.

Boris Johnson said on Tuesday that Britons may have to put their lives on hold for three months to stop the spread of the killer virus.The Daily Mail reports the government may advise people to cut back on things like going out to the pub, shopping, and eating out in an effort to contain the disease.

And NHS England has ordered hospitals to review their intensive care bed numbers and how they could be increased to cope with a surge in cases. Hospitals have been told to draw up plans to segregate wards such as AE departments in the event of a signicant escalation in cases. Keith Willett, head of NHS coronavirus planning, told hospitals to step up their planning. He said all acute units will be needed to treat coronavirus patients as the outbreak grows. “Consider implementing alternative models such as remote consultations for those patients who can be supported at home, hospitals have been told.

The royal family has been embroiled in a number of scandals recently, including Prince Andrewaposs friendship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Kate and Williamaposs visit also comes ahead of Meghan and Harryaposs final official engagement as they prepare to step down as senior royals. The three-day trip to Ireland also marks the first official visit carried out by any member of the Royal Family since Brexit. Kate emulated the Queen and Duchess of Sussex by wearing green, in a symbolic gesture to the country. The Duchess wore the Alessandra Rich dress, paired with a green Catherine Walker coat, and matching green clutch bag.

Nothing seemed to click but when I booked to go to the Florida theme parks I thought I should really start to do something about my weight. I had been to theme parks like Alton Towers and Thorpe Park before and couldnapost get on anything because of my size. I was the bag holder the whole day.

At the beginning of last year my kids and I had bronchitis. We have never had it before and I think itaposs from living here because the mould keeps growing all the time. When we came to view the flat it was lovely. Mould then started to appear about three to four months after we moved in on July , . There was quite a lot of mould and there was a funny smell I couldnapost pinpoint. I then found mould in the cupboards, as well as on the walls around the flat. I got in touch with The Guinness Partnership and told them how bad it was, and have been back to them numerous time since. Thermal boards were put in the front room and my bedroom. I was told it would stop the mould but it hasnapost.  In September last year, Lauren had a new bath, towel rail and flooring fitted, and some wall tiles replaced. The ceiling also had mould treatment but she said it failed to solve the problem and work is now being carried out on it again. The housing association says the property is suffering from penetrating damp and a damp specialist will be attending to identy works required. Lauren said: The mould has been growing back horrendously since. The bathroom is now completely ruined and paint is coming off.  In my daughteraposs room there is bad mould by the side of her bed as well as at the back of my bed. We also get mould in the wardrobes and on the ceilings. I keep being promised things which have not yet been done. I have previously been told the reason for the mould is the type of house it is and to keep the windows open and the property ventilated, which I do anyway. I have also tried treating it myself. I continue to wipe the mould away and have painted the walls with anti-mould paint, but it doesnapost work. A housing officer and surveyor came out two weeks ago and I was told they would look at the drains to seethey are blocked because I have damp as well as mould.

The terrying incident happened when Faheem Mohammed, , was confronted by a group of hooded yobs, some of whom were armed, in Longton Hall Road, Stoke-on-Trent. The dad-of-one had been walking his dog near his home in Blurton at the time, and ran for his le when the men emerged from six cars, he claimed. When he managed to get inside his house, he says the attackers, one of them wearing a balaclava, rammed one of their cars into his gate while making threats against his family. Six cars pulled up at the side of me and men got out carrying baseball bats. My instinct kicked in and I ran to my house. I ran for my le, he told Stoke-on-Trent Live.  The group of lads chased me to my address in Blurton with weapons and were doing everything to try to get in the house. They all had their hoods up and one was wearing a balaclava.  But the quick-thinking dad - whose we has recently undergone brain surgery and was inside at the time - says he managed to scare the attackers off with an ornamental samurai sword. I was able to get in and get my ornamental samurai sword which I was swinging to scare them off and keep them away from my house where my partner Jade Stonier and my six-year-old son were inside, he continued. Jade is just recovering from brain surgery as well.  If I didnapost have that sword then something bad would definitely have happened. A neighbour also came out and tried to help me as much as he could. It was very scary. They were shouting saying they were going to run through my house and I did everything I could to protect my family. They said they were going to smash up the house and do bad things to my child and partner. They even rammed one of the cars into my gate to try to get in and it has smashed part of the wall. Staffordshire Police have released footage of the incident, and any witnesses are asked to get in touch. Two arrests have been made so far as officers continue to investigate. Mr Mohammed, who says vandals have smashed his propertyaposs windows on three previous occasions, says the attack has left his family scared in our own home. If I hadnapost made it home I would be in hospital. Weaposre scared in our own home now but I wonapost let them win by moving, he said. There needs to be a criminal sentence for these people. It was a traumatising experience, it was just horrible. Itaposs disgusting what they did, but I just did everything I could to keep them out. A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: Officers were called to reports of several men in the area with weapons.

Despite the winter being one of warmest on record, with a provisional mean temperature across the country of .C, last night parts of the UK dipped to -C. Weather maps from the Met Office show temperatures having dropped to their lowest in Loch Rannoch, Scotland, in the early hours of Wednesday, while Brighton dropped to zero.And that trend is set to continue for much of the rest of the week, with the likes of Newtown, Wales, also hitting freezing in the early hours of Friday. BBC meteorologist Darren Bett, meanwhile, said Wednesday will see a break from that sort of mixture of weathers Britain has seen since the start of March. He said an area of low pressure will thicken the cloud from the south, spilling some rain northwards with some uncertainty how far the showers will spread. Ahead of that though itaposs a cold and frosty start with some sunshine, but the cloud thickens from the south west where we see that rain moving northwards into Wales, into the south east of England and the Midlands, he said.  The meteorologist added the wettest weather would be in northern Ireland, however, as the day progresses. The Environment Agency has issued  flood warnings and  alerts - unwelcome news for those Brits forced out of their submerged homes after the country saw a flurry of named storms bursting river banks and battering defences. Mr Bett went on to say there would be some snow over the hills of Wales by the end of the day and perhaps some into the Peak District.  We are looking at some sunshine for Scotland and showers in the north west, and for south west England and for south Wales we could get some showers later after the rain clears, and itaposs here we will see the highest temperatures. That rain continues to slowly drt northwards across East Anglia, Lincolnshire and into northern England. Again, a bit of snow over the Pennines.

The -year-old woman was held as a slave by cruel Rita Jablonskaite and her partner Robertas Repsas - who also organised the smuggling of the desperate, homeless man. Both victims were trafficked from Lithuania and were forced to work at the home of Jablonskaite, , and Repsas, , for no money. Often the victims were fed just one small meal a day, with the woman saying she would sometimes feel so starved, she would cry. Detectives were only initially alerted after the trafficked man found a discarded mobile phone at his masteraposs home, and managed to top it up with cash found in rubbish at a nearby glass recycling plant, where he also worked.The -year-old desperately called the Lithuanian embassy before police became involved, reports the Liverpool Echo .The woman was then also eventually freed from her invisible handcuffs after scribbling a message asking for help on a piece of police paperwork when officers visited the home as part of their investigation. When officers attended the Warrington address in March , they discovered the manaposs accommodation was a mattress in a cupboard under the stairs at Jablonskaite and Repsasapos home. He had been cleaning and gardening and, from November , had also worked full time for a recycling company, but he never received the wages, Liverpool Crown Court heard. The victim came to Warrington in a mini-bus in June  and had been made to work as a domestic servant. He referred to Jablonskaite and Repsas as his owners. It later emerged he was homeless in Lithuania and had been approached by a man there, who offered him the chance to live and work in the UK with a Lithuanian family. He was told heaposd be required to clean the house in exchange for food, accommodation and cigarettes and when he arrived he would be given £ upfront and a phone.  The female victim, , told police how she was approached in Lithuania by Jablonskaiteaposs father who said she could earn money by working for his daughter’s cleaning firm in the UK. She also travelled to the UK in a shuttle bus and was left outside the defendant’s home which was then in Westland Drive, in the early hours of the morning. The woman was made to clean and look after the defendant’s young daughter. There was no bed for her and she was forced to sleep on the sofa in the living room. She was often given just one meal a day and spoke of being so hungry sometimes that she cried. Jablonskaite and Repsas were today jailed for  months and  months respectively. She admitted three counts of arranging or facilitating the travel of another person with a view to exploitation while Repsas pleaded guilty to one count of the same offence.  They were prosecuted under the Modern Slavery Act at Liverpool Crown Court. The female victim was only discovered five months after police first arrested Repsas and Jablonskaite. Nicola Wyn Williams, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Repsas and Jablonskaite trafficked vulnerable people to this country, by deceiving them that they would get paid work in the UK and improve their lives. The opposite was the case. “They were used as slaves by the defendants who removed their ID documents and took total control over their money, their bank accounts and their lives. “The victims couldn’t leave the house without asking permission and had no way of breaking free and raising the alarm. Repsas and Jablonskaite had made both victims totally dependent on them.

Trapped on the island of Lesbos that has become their prison, the family who fled the Taliban watch as the promise of freedom escapes their grasp in a charge of riot shields and rubber batons. In the pretty harbour of Mytilini, the island’s capital, refugees from war-torn nations such as Syria and Afghanistan are being rounded up to ensure they do not get any further into Europe. Ripped off by people-smugglers in Turkey who charged them £, for an illegal three-hour journey across the Aegean Sea in an inflatable dinghy, they have now been tricked again. As the stand-off simmers, officers force hundreds of refugees on to buses to be taken back to a camp where around , people live in squalor, unable to move forward or go back. Davood, , says he has been waiting seven months to get his family to the Greek mainland. Conned into believing Turkey’s promise last week that Europe’s borders would be open, the wait goes on. His sons Ati, four, and Mohammad, two, are in poor health and exhausted. Davood says: “We left Afghanistan for our safety a year ago. We left because my two brothers were killed by the Taliban. “For a month we walked through Iran then Turkey. Imagine that with two kids. Their whole lives have been horrible. “All the money we have, after giving our savings to the smugglers, is the cost of a ferry ticket to Athens. But they won’t allow us to go there. They won’t give us the stamp on our asylum forms.”Davood adds: “We all came today because we had been told they were letting people on the ferries. Instead we are being herded by police. “We came here to escape the Taliban, now the Greek police are coming at us.” Davood, a farmer in his home village near Herat, and Tawos, , left Afghanistan to work and get their lads into school, without the daily threat of terror attacks and torture. As they herded migrants through the harbour, the officers shouted in English: “Move, move – no papers to Athens.” Greece’s government is forcibly repelling migrants trying to get in, and they are doing their utmost to deter families from staying. The angry scenes in Mytilini were played out in front of British Border Force ship HMC Valiant, in Lesbos to help with the European effort to stem the flow of illegal immigration.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/Gjen_Dundee_United_Academy-4-scaled.jpg ","title":"dundee united academy coaches helping club move with trends in modern game","story":"Dundee United academy duo Thomas Courts and Andy Payne are working to shape ‘modern’ stars of the future under the club’s revamped grassroots set-up.Since academy director Andy Goldie took charge of the Terrors’ youth ranks in February last year, the club have achieved ‘Elite’ status in the Scottish FA’s Project Brave initiative and helped introduced the likes of Louis Appere and Declan Glass to Robbie Neilson’s first team.Helping make United’s one of the best youth set-ups in the country has been a new staff, including head of tactical performance Courts, formerly manager of Kelty Hearts, and head of technical performance Payne, coach at the club for  years and nephew of ex-Tannadice star Graham.Their remit oversees the younger kids in the academy from U  to U , with the pair working closely to develop players equipped for the on-the-ball and off-the-ball demands of first-team football in .And theirs are roles they find very rewarding as they watch youngsters fulfil their potential – whether that’s with Dundee United, another club or outwith football altogether.Courts said: “I think within the academy set-up what we’re trying to do is give them a technical and tactical framework that can allow them to maximise their potential.“It’s actually also about surviving and thriving domestically and playing within Scotland.“We’re taking them down to the elite level in England and overseas in Europe for games and learning.“We want to design a game model that allows them to go into dferent environments and feel they have the skillset to fulfil their potential.” vw, px\"  Both men feel there is a profile of ‘creative flair’ when you think of a Dundee United player, which they are keen to maintain within their plans.Payne said: “I suppose there is. Obviously, we look at it by position to try to make them better technically and tactically but we want all players comfortable in taking the ball.“We’re not fixated on systems and formations right across the club, we want to do what’s right for our inidual players.“It’s also about getting us to empower the coaches to be able to deliver those same messages across the board. We’re constantly reviewing and adapting our model. We don’t want to just stand still. We need to move forward with the modern trends of the game.“There’s needs to be a balance of letting kids express themselves and being free at certain points but also hammering home the technical and tactical elements of their game.”Of the environment at Tannadice, Courts added: “The club’s invested quite heavily in additional staff members like ourselves but also video analysis and physical performance.“We look at the full player as an athlete, first and foremost, but it’s all in collaboration with the technical, tactical and physical performance.“It’s a club on an upward trajectory again and they’ve got a phenomenal reputation historically for developing young players.“There’s a blueprint and something ingrained within the club.

It was sport, it was boxing, it was football – and every pub on that landscape was steeped in stories of legends and heroes of renown.“And on such a Saturday at noon in , I, an apprentice, along with four journeymen, left our job site at Dundee University and headed along Park Place toward Hawkhill.“It was agreed we would stop and have one pint – no more, then be off on our separate ways.“My elusive memory can’t decide which pub we entered, it was either Mickey Coyle’s or The Globe.“Whatever establishment it was, business was ramping up to a steady Saturday afternoon crowd.”Betting was illegal in those days, but there were ways around that, as Rob continued: “Standing at the bar sipping on a pint was a bookie’s runner making his rounds of the local pubs.“From punters, he accepted money and slips of paper signed with a nom-de-plume and scribed with a meticulous studied selection of racing form – along with hopes and dreams of a Saturday night windfall.“As pints were poured, the discussion continued.“The euphoria from Dundee’s very own Dick McTaggart’s recent magnicent and glorious Olympic achievement had mellowed and everyone had evolved from a fan to a McTaggart advisor – should Dick turn professional or stay amateur and become an ambassador for his sport “As a young lad I was undergoing my indoctrination into the protocol of behaviour in the company of elders in a licensed establishment.“And I watched and listened to the debate of the journeymen as they detailed the pros and cons of stepping up from amateur to professional in the sweet science of boxing.“The advice was well thought out and worthy of consideration. But it was Dick who made his own decision – a decision he doesn’t regret.”The discussion then suddenly veered into who was the best football player to ever play in Dundee Junior leagues.Rob went on: “The journeymen were veterans of WW, when young men of their generation had lived and breathed football in that glorious sports decade of the ’s when Dundee was saturated with talent and the city was a giant encompassing sports stadium.“They were men from another time.“A name came forth – Tiddler Forbes.“According to two of the journeymen, he was the greatest dribbler of a ball – bar none.“They were emphatic that Tiddler could do things with a ball that no other mortal could.“Some years ago, I am positive I read in BwB a reference to Tiddler Forbes.“However, I can’t recall the content of the article.“What stays with me is not just the name, what stays with me is the utmost conviction of the journeymen who declared Tiddler Forbes the greatest junior football player of their generation.”I also can’t recall the reference, so, is there a BwB reader with any information on Tiddler Forbes "},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-glasgows-queen-barras-five-facts-maggie-mciver","story":" Maggie McIver, Queen of the Barras, had her first taste of business when she looked after a family friendrsquos fruit barrow in Parkhead.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

An enhanced community care model is an excellent idea # but healthcare professionals are adamant that Knapdale Ward should be retained, with improvements made in discussion with staff.It is needed, they say, as an option within Argyll when the home environment is no longer suitable for dementia sufferers, their families and carers.Serious questions need to be answered.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

It was all so surprising.#I have never won anything for essentially just being myself. Anyone  in the category absolutely deserved to win, so it really is an honour.#Throughout high school, Josh was a victim of bullying, struggling to understand who he was as a person and confused by his own thoughts and feelings.

It wasn#t until moving to Glasgow and being more involved with the LGBTQ+ community he gained a better understanding of himself and being transgender.Returning home to Lochgilphead, Josh came out as transgender, ultimately finding his true self.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"brushing-regions-biggest-ever-art-fair","story":"MANY of the regions leading painters and sculptors are brushing up ahead of the biggest arts fair ever held in the

the style of sculpture has a isive effect on opinion, the statue has and continues to attract visitors to the Borders.Isabel Hay from the William Wallace Society believes more should be done to protect the monument.She said: \"I am concerned about the disrepair of the statue.\"It hasnt been looked after and its in the public interest for this tribute to William Wallace to be saved.\"We as a

He was .As a descendant of the famous Ballantyne clan, whose links to the Scottish woollen trade can be traced back to the mid-th century, Mr Brett upheld the family tradition by carving out a successful career in the fast-changing Borders textile industry.The son of an army officer, Lt Col. Denis Brett, and his we Katherine , Denis Roland Brett was born in  in Dehri Dun, India, where his father was serving with the Leicestershire Regiment.At the age of seven he was sent to Blairmore preparatory school in Aberdeenshire, then on to Haileybury School in Hertfordshire. There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

You should self-isolateyou have travelled to any of the following places:to Hubei province in China in the last  daysto Iran, areas of northern Italy in lockdown or \"special care zone\" areas in South Korea since  Februaryto other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last  days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathto other parts of northern Italy , Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar since  February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathHow do I self-isolate The best place to self-isolate yourself is obviously your own home, where you should stay for the duration of your quarantine.This means you shouldnt go to work, school or public areas, and not use any public transport or taxis.If you need something from outside your home, you canask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you.But youre advised to try to avoid visitors to your home, though it is OK for friends and family or delivery drivers to drop off food and other supplies.WhatIm not at home Of course, its possible that any coronavirus symptoms could arise while youre out and about.If this is the case, the official advice insists that you do not go to a GP surgery or hospital, as that could spread the virus inordinately.Instead, you should try to find a room to isolate yourself away from others. Ask for helpyou need to, but try to stay at least two metres away from other people.Open a window for ventilationyou can, but otherwise touch objects and surfaces as little as possible, and call  for advice.If you find yourself on public transport and become unwell, you should go back to your home or place of residence immediately.How long should I self-isolate for ,params: .pushYou may need to do this for up to  days to help reduce the possible spread of infection.What are the symptoms of coronavirus Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, with the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionexplaining they usually cause ldquomild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold.This particular strain originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, the largest city in central China, and is in the same family as SARS and MERS .The symptoms of coronavirus are:a cougha high temperatureshortness of breathBut these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness.The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as cold and flu."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-self-isolation---can-affect-rights-pay-work","story":"UPuntil a week ago many of us had probably never heard the term lsquoself-isolationrsquo.But now not a day goes by without us being aware of people who have been asked or chosen to isolate themselves in order to try and minimise the spread of the Coronavirus.Nicole Rogers, Solicitor at DAS Law, has been looking at the impact this has on workers rights and pay.If I feel that I should be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use annual leaveyou are medically unfit for work.However in many other circumstances, your employer can force you to take annual leavethey provide you with adequate notice twice the amount of the days you are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid statutory sick pay while Irsquom away from work Onlyyou are medically unfit for work and meet the eligibility criteria for Statutory Sick Pay.Will my pay be affectedI have to stay at home due to my childrsquos school being closed You have the right to reasonable time off to deal with unexpected disruptions relating to the care of your child this includes incidents relating to your childrsquos school.You must noty your employer as soon as possible and advise, where practicable, how long the disruption is likely to last.This time off is unpaid but you may request to use this time as paid annual leave.If I am on a lsquozero hoursrsquo contract will I lose pay for the time I am away from work Genuine zero-hour workers have no right to be offered work and no obligation to accept work.Therefore, you will likely have no right to pay.In the event that you have been advised to self-isolate, your employer will be entitled to simply not offer you any work until the isolation period

Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin.

Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength. She bade her time there, kenning she would be able taeand reclaim her throne when darkness once again ed tae the land.ldquoIn autumn, said one of the children.ldquoAye, smiled the gran.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why we hae arsquo these winds and storms just noo. Beria is trying tae stop spring and the rule orsquo Queen Bride. And we still hae the three days orsquo snaw tae come, but ater that Beria will huv tae flee.ldquoWhy didnrsquot they kill Beria, then itrsquoll be summer all the time  asked one of the older children.The gran smiled. ldquoAngus was Beriarsquos son. They were all related, just like the seasons, although they fought each other for a place they all needed each other and were part of the same family.ldquoJust like us.ldquoAye.ldquoGran, can we have more hot chocolate and can you tell us the other stories about Beria  asked a grandchild.ldquoOrsquo course, said the gran, ldquobut we wud need a hale winter tae tell arsquo the stories aboot her.

children in its group.However, East Lothian Council has told the group it needs to move out of the building, which stores all its camping equipment, as well as giving it a base in the community.The council says the hall costs over pound, a year to maintain, claiming pound, of that is caused by cleaning costs while it only receives an income of pound from the Scouts to use it.Scout leader Sam Cowie said: ldquoThe bulk of the cost the council says is caused by cleaning our Scouts would clean it themselvesit helped us remain in the hall.Mr Cowie said that the group had been left with nowhere to store its equipment, including the camping gear, after the council said the Scouts had to clear out by the end of March.The hall opened  years ago in the village after a drive by then Scout leaders and youth group organisers to raise funds towards it.It replaced a previous recreation hut which was originally opened by the Church of Scotland in  as a canteen during the First World War but had to be demolished as part of a housing expansion.The hut itself opened without fanfare, amid claims the local Labour councillors at the time wanted to distance themselves from any decision to invest in

Road ndash from which access to the site will come ndash to the east.Mrs Fraser felt that it was not the correct site for the development and instead suggested it could be built at Harperdean, off the

development be turned down.But he was unsuccessful, despite the support of councillors Sue Kempson, Jeremy Findlay, Kenny McLeod and Katie Mackie.Mr McMillan confirmed that he planned to write to the

the most recent year for which data is available - a total of , people died in Scotland from all forms of cancer.However, scrutiny of the latest figures for Hubei, the Chinese province where the virus first originated in December, shows that there have been , confirmed cases in a population of just over m - an incidence rate of .%.In China as a whole, there are now , confirmed cases of Covid- in a population of over . billion - equivalent to six per , people - while in Italy, which has the third highest prevalence of the virus in the world, there are three cases for every , people.Professor Rowland Kao, chair of veterinary epidemiology and data science at University of Edinburghrsquos Roslin Institute, said: \"I think what it comes down to is that when we talk about worst case scenarios, the implication is when you do nothing to stop it.\"Now of course in Hubei theyve done everything they can to stop it. Probably more than anyone  in the world.\"Politically, China is obviously much better placed to put up very stringent controls. So the number they have is partially due to that response.\": Scotland facing chronic shortage of consultantsA WHO report published on Friday February  credited Chinas \"aggressive response\" for curtailing the spread of the virus.The number of new cases peaked in early February and has been slowing ever since, while transmission has escalated in the rest of the world.The WHO report said China had \"rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history\", and in doing so \"has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic.Interventions included the lockdown of Wuhan - the city at the centre of the outbreak - and nearby cities in Hubei province.Elsewhere in China people voluntarily quarantined themselves with their compliance monitored by appointed neighbourhood leaders.Two new dedicated hospitals were built in Wuhan within a week - with many of the beds now lying empty - and aggressive \"social distancing\" measures were implemented, such as cancelling sporting fixtures, closing theatres and cinemas, and extending the Chinese New Year school holidays.WHO scientists who visited hospitals, railway stations, food markets, and other public spaces described \"a sense of responsibility and collective action...therersquos war footing to get things done.In Western democracies, such stringent controls and cooperation are harder to imagine, but the UK governments battle plan includes potential measures such as school closures, putting the Army on standby to help fill gaps in emergency services arising from an outbreak, giving health boards the power to detain people with the virus and stop them from travelling, or forcing those suspected of having the virus to be tested and quarantined under court order.Professor Kao believes the -% figure for peak outbreak in the UK has probably been extrapolated using something called the \"basic reproduction number\", a theoretical model used by scientists to predict the limits of an outbreak.He added: \"Its a funny thing because you want to motivate people enough to listen, but you dont want to scare them.\"You want them to do the things that are sensible. If people dont take it seriously, theyre pretty much going to go about their daily business.\"That includes people who are a little bit sick still going to work, or still sending their kids to school.\"So what youre trying to do is say look,we actually do nothing, these are the kinds of numbers we could end up with.\"A Scottish Government spokesmansaid: ldquoA lsquoreasonable worst case scenariorsquo would be that -% of the population might become infected.

Experts have also warned that the Covid- virus could even enter the body through the eyes, which most masks do not cover.

Asa woman ceases to be a womanshe canrsquot have children.These canards are still re on social media with people arguing that clown fish changing sex, and people born intersex ldquoprovethat there is no fixed biological definition of sex.Humans are of course mammals, not fish. The existence of a minuscule number of people born intersexdoesnrsquot alter the fact that . per cent of humans are born male or female.Humans are a binary species. We are not hermaphrodites. Sexual dferentiation is the basis of human reproduction. That this needs to be said is a shocking reflection on the intellectual integrity of the left. Many supposedly sensible people have been morally coerced into accepting something they know to be untrue. It is deeply worrying.Most SNP politicians know that transgender ideology is nonsense. They keep quiet partly because of fear of Britainrsquos onerous hate speech laws.It has been left to genuinely courageous women like Joan McAlpine MSP and Joanna Cherry, MP, to fight for reason. For doing so they have been the target of astonishing abuse on social media, and from the trans activists embedded in the SNP.Academics like Lucy Hunter Blackburn have bravely challenged the proposal to remove the question on sex from the national census.This has nothing to do with ldquotransgender rights. Trans people are free to identy as anyone they wish. No one is stopping them wearing what they want or loving who they wish. This is not homophobia ..In fact, advocates of Self-ID, like Stonewall, have set back the cause of trans rights by harnessing it to a quasi-religious dogma.Mr Pringle and others in the SNP now realise that the Scottish Government is marching into a minefield by persevering with Self-ID without proper debate. Given the pause in England, it could lead to a transgender Gretna Green.But there is an equitable solution. Of course allow transwomen to identy as female without needless bureaucratic obstacles. But the Government should make clear in the legislation reforming the Gender Recognition Act that this does not mean abolishing the biological definition of sex or infringing womenrsquos sex-based rights under the Equalities Act.Yoursquod think that a feminist like Nicola Sturgeon would regard that as self-evident. Perhaps she does. Butso she needs to say it loud and clear before half the voting population ndash women ndash turn against the SNP.Read more: Super Tuesday will showcase Democrats dismal failure to take on Donald Trump"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-caught-bedroom","story":"ITrsquoS the fishing season, we are reliably informed.

Itrsquos that containment measures and closures ndash should they prove necessary ndash create practical headaches, too shutting a school, for example, will almost certainly take out of action a lot of healthcare workers, as would public transport restrictions.If it turns out that widespread ldquoself-isolation becomes necessary, it will obviously have a huge impact on such frontline services, and on sectors such as retail, logistics and hospitality.A lot of other parts of the economy, however, may be surprisingly resilient. Itrsquos dficult to find out how many of those employed in the UK would be ableto work from home, but itrsquos likely to be a fair number. Most people who spend the majority of their time on a computer and telephone ndash which must be a signicant proportion of the workforce ndash could as easily do that at home.Managers, professionals, administrative and secretarial workers are more than  per cent of all those employed not all of them will be able to do everything remotely, but five years ago, more than  per cent of the UK workforceworked almost exclusively from home. At that stage, it was estimated that half the UK workforce would work remotely by .That obviously isnrsquot the case, and I donrsquot suppose that anyone would regard it as a vindication of the predictionit were to happen this year, but only as a result of a pandemic that had us all quarantined in our bedrooms, checking in with the office on Skype, Slack or Microsoft Teams.But given we have such tools for security, video-conferencing, multi-user messaging and real-time supervision, itrsquos rather odd that ldquotelecommuting hasnrsquot become the default for more jobs. With the exception of a few industries, remote working tends to be something that, for those who do it at all, is confined to a day or two a week, rather than the norm.Yet, as well as the obvious savings for employers in providing office space, as well as ancillary costs , all the research suggests that those who work mainly from home are more productive, motivated and happier. The advantages arenrsquot just flexibility in work le balance or quality of living there are real material advantages in commuting and housing costs ndash especially for those who live outside major cities.We should be using the necessity for such measures during our current dficulties to overcome the resistance to introducing this kind of model much more widely. Think, for example, of the boon for meeting climate targets,we could take a few million daily commuters out of the equation, and the likely geographical redistribution of skilled work and income.Imagine the savings in care costs that would be produced with a more flexible workforce, the boost to small businesses and local high streetspeople popped out from home, on foot or by bicycle, for their errands, rather than concentrating their spending around office blocks in city centres.If it comes to that, it could have a profound impact on housing, one of the great distortions in the economy, by allowing the repurposing of city centre offices for accommodation, while offering those who prefer the country or the suburbs the ability to work there instead. Staying away from the office could be just the economic boost the country needs."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  It  39 s time we moved on from obsession with the terrible Tudors","story":"Anne Boleyn did not emerge centre stage like Botticellirsquos Venus, but some believe it was here that Henry VIII first caught sight of her.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there.

A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night.

Prices of up to £ to be a mascot is outrageous and will eventually make mascot opportunities the preserve of the rich.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadLarne tragedy: Toddler dies, mum Fiona McGowan and baby in hospital after stabbing at farmhouseOff-duty officer#s bid to arrest boy over snowball incident in Northern Ireland probed by OmbudsmanCoronavirus outbreak: Northern Ireland holidaymakersfrom Spain after being quarantined for two weeksBBC#s Stephen Nolan puts Twitter trolls #who should know better# on notice he will fight backChurch of Ireland minister Mark Watson dies suddenly at Fermanagh home,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.”Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed.“It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!“I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble.“I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above.There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin was speaking after details were published of locations visited by potential inward investors to Northern Ireland hosted by Invest NI. In the   year, there were  visitsto Belfast, compared to just sixin the Foyle constituency and a meagre two visits in East Derry. Invest NI is Northern Irelands regional economic development agency. It is a non-departmental public body of the Department for the Economy . googletag.cmd.push According to its own website its role is to grow the local economy. “We do this by helping new and existing businesses to compete internationally, and by attracting new investment to Northern Ireland,” it adds. The agency has come in for harsh criticism from Derry representatives in recent weeks after attending a Derry City  Strabane District Council meeting where it was branded “Invest Belfast” and taken to task for failing to promote the North West to potential investors. Just days later, at a Department for the Economy Committee meeting with Invest NI, DUP MLA Christopher Stalford accused Sinead McLaughlin of engaging in the “politics of envy” when she insisted that a sub-regional strategy was needed to address “disparities” across the country. googletag.cmd.push Following the publication of statistics that show almost % of Invest NI visits are to Belfast locations, SDLP Economy Spokesperson Sinead McLaughlin MLA has sought an urgent meeting with Diane Dodds, Economy Minister. The Foyle MLA said: “The focus on Belfast from Invest NI will not be a surprise to many, but the statistics released recently are particularly damning, with almost % of potential investor visits limited to Belfast. “These statistics are only confirmation of what we already know and understand about where investment goes. “It is their mantra that they do not promote one place more over another. If Foreign Direct Investorsland in Belfast and are not taken anywhere  then it is indicative of only promoting one place.”  Skills deficit  Northern Ireland’s skills deficit, she says, is closely linked to its geography, with the strongest skills based in and around Belfast – whereas areas West of the Bann have some of the highest proportions of adults with no qualications, analysis of an NI Assembly briefing document has shown. Almost half the adult population of West Tyrone – % - have no qualications. Other areas with a high proportion of adults without qualications at level  or above include Mid-Ulster , Fermanagh and South Tyrone , Upper Bann , and Newry and Armagh . The Foyle MLA went on to say that sub-regional targets must be written into law and incentives put in place to ensure that investment is spread across the country. “If we keep on doing what we are doing we are going to get the same results, it is fundamentally wrong. People can’t keep on using the same old excuses for regional disparities. “Northern Ireland’s skills deficit is closely linked to its geography, with the strongest skills based in and around Belfast – while the areas West of the Bann have some of the highest proportions of adults with no qualications, analysis of official statistics reveals. “I have written to Minister Dodds to seek an urgent meeting where I will press for inclusion of sub regional investment targets in the new Economy Strategy.” Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson asked the Minister for the Economy whether she plans to set targets for Invest NI to ensure future jobs are located in Foyle. Diane Dodds, DUP MLA, said: “All targets within the extant Invest NI Business Strategy - are on a regional i.e. Northern Ireland wide basis. “Invest NI supports Councils to drive economic development in their area. Each Council has its own Community Plan, with targets for investment and growth. “Derry City and Strabane District Council has set a target of , jobs by . Invest NI’s support for businesses in the region will contribute towards this.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence.

Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

McDonagh admitted that the win was important for team morale.“Our first win of the season means it gives us a wee bit of confidence going into the Waterford, so yeah it was important to win,” he said. “We have got a bit of confidence now and I know all the boys will be looking forward to the Waterford match.“We’ll be going there looking to exploit them and get three points again, because that feeling of getting three points against Bohs is special and we want to get as many points as possible.”The importance of keeping a clean sheet was not lost on the Derry City players, particularly after two scoreless draws between the club last season.“Whenever we came in at half-time the manager talked about making sure we keep a clean-sheet,” McDonagh continued. “Obviously we felt comfortable in the first half and knew that we were doing quite well and knew that we just needed to get that goal and keep a clean-sheet.“If you keep a clean-sheet in this league you have a good chance in winning games, so we done that and that’s credit to the back-four and everyone as a whole, but as I said keeping clean-sheets are ideal. “It will stand us in good stead and we’ll be looking to keep this momentum going and hopefully we can get a few more clean-sheets, because I’m sure we have got the players to win us more games.” googletag.cmd.push ImportantMcDonagh heaped praise on goal scorer Stephen Mallon, who made a memorable contribution on his first start for the club.“That’s why Stevie was brought to the club and we see that in training every day and that’s why he was given his chance,” he explained.“It’s important in those close games that we take our chances and Stevie did that tonight. It was a bit of magic from him and it’s a great goal from him. I think it was important to get up and running and get the three points, as it will do the team a world of good.”McDonagh is now hoping that the Candystripes can build on the momentum from Friday, both inidually and collectively.“There were a lot of good performances and we looked solid at the back and the whole team collectively you could see we are starting to come together, things are starting to work and we can only get better from now,” he stated. “Waltergetting his goal will also do him the world of good as well and it’s good to get two dferent goalscorers and it will give the boys confidence.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns

roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead. This advantage was quickly cancelled out by Gallagher, but Down continued to press and further scores from Liam Kerr and Barry OrsquoHagan sent the home side into the break with a - to - lead.Down controlled play at the start of the second half and points from OrsquoHare and Quinn stretched their lead to four points.However, no sooner had the Down supporters started to relax as their side moved well clear, when Longford roared back with - without reply to take a shock - to - lead.Connerton rocked the boat when he goaled out of nothing and when Dessie Reynolds and Gallaghertagged on points, the visitors were suddenly in the driving seat.Down now faced an uphill task, but they refused to panic and with  minutes gone Liam Kerr started the fightback with a point from play.Barry OrsquoHagan converted a free and it was suddenly all square again, but the predatory Quinn pounced to give Down a - to - lead with five minutes remaining with a well-worked goal.A free from Daniel Mimnagh another rsquo from Collum saw Longford trail by a single point with only a matter of minutes left on the clock.Down really went for broke at this stage and they were rewarded when James Guinness showed his versatility with a cool finish when he put the home side into an unassailable - to - lead with the  minutes almost up.Longford never stopped trying, but all they had to show for their efforts was another Mimnagh point.Down take to the road again this weekend when they head to OrsquoConnor Park to take on Offaly on Sunday afternoon for another must win game.Down: R Burns, S Annett, P Murdock, R McAleenan, G Collins, D OrsquoHagan , B McArdle, J Flynn , D Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , K McKernan , L KerrD OrsquoHare , A Morgan, C Quinn .

In these opening minutes, BRA did enjoy a sustained period of play in Down High territory, but the home town defence was watertight.Back at the other end Ben Gibson was unlucky not to get points when he was adjudged to have been held up over the line after a period of play close the BRA line.Finally, around  minutes into the half, the pressure turned into points with Joe Charles driving over from short range for an unconverted try.It was the second half before Down High added to their tally. This time the pack provided the  with a very convincing driven maul.Having driven towards the BRA line at great pace, the referee felt the BRA infringement to stop the maul was so stark that he marched under the posts, awarding Down a penalty try to take the score line to -.With a reasonable buffer, the local lads did lt their foot a little off the gas.A few BRA replacements made a big impact and in a relatively short space of time the North Belfast outfit had scored two converted tries, giving them a - lead.With  minutes to go, Down, now chasing the game, had to produce something special.

I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it. This common-sense approach is very welcome.ldquoThe government department has confirmed that the review will commence in the coming months, with Ms Mallon seeking views and asking stakeholders to engage with the process.

However, the securing and locating of a temporary mobile facility for the short-term was welcome.Mr McGrath said that while the building was able to use a generator provided by the contractor for the switching-on of a sustainable Christmas tree provided by the council, the generator did not remain in place.He continued: ldquoI have contacted council and made representations and have been told the relevant committee has discussed and approved the long-term use of a generator which will allow activities to commence soon.

So I’ve set up a website https:theblankpage.kellymccaughrain to give support, tips and advice to secondary school librarians and teachers who’d like to set up creative writing clubs in their schools. ‘‘There’s been a fantastic response so far and it makes me so happy to think that there are new writing clubs being set up all over NI. I never had a writing club or writer friends as a teen and I know it would have been such an encouragement and helped with my shyness about writing. It’s wonderful for kids to be shown that grades aren’t everything and that these non-curriculum skills are valued by their schools.’’Kelly believes the key to turning children who are reluctant readers into bookworms is ‘‘turning parents into bookworms first.’’‘‘Kids emulate their parents, so they need to see their parents enjoy, value and make time for reading. If parents treat books as ‘kids stuff’ or ‘homework’ or ‘good for you’ in the same way that broccoli is ‘good for you’, then kids will see them that way too. Kids love it when you do activities with them, they love your presence and attention. So instead of Movie Night, have a weekly Reading Night. Don’t make reading something that excludes a child from the family while everyone  watches TV together, make it a family event. ‘‘I told my sister this theory recently and she tried it with her two primary-aged sons. TV off, fire lit, snacks prepared, mum, dad and kids all got out books and settled down to read. She thought they’d stick it for about  minutes before asking for their tablets. In fact, they read for an hour and afterwards her eldest said, ‘That was brilliant, can we do it again next week ’’’Whilst many parents may have good intentions, book poverty is an issue for many low-income families and Kelly admits she worries about the future of our libraries. ‘‘I think they need much more support. They can be the only way to access books for low-income families. And when you look at the letime benefits of early reading, that contribution to a child’s le just can’t be overstated.’’She also worries about the commercial aspect of World Book Day, as parents may struggle to kit their children out in the latest costume.‘‘I think that’s certainly a risk and it’s another symptom of our tendency to try to ‘lure’ children towards reading by offering them rewards. Asreading is a chore they have to do in order to have the reward of costumes. So many reading initiatives do this. They start out with the assumption that kids don’t want to read and have to be tricked or bribed into it I’d like to see books reframed as the reward rather than the chore.’’ Kelly is thankful she grew up in an environment where reading was cherished and encouraged.‘‘I was very lucky, my dad is a brilliant storyteller and read to me every night and my mum bought me a Ladybird book every week with her ‘big shop’. ‘‘When I was old enough to walk to the library I stole the entire family’s collection of library cards and the librarian turned a blind eye. ‘‘There were no computers then and kids’ TV was only on for about an hour a day so it was probably easier to raise a reader but I’m also aware of how much influence the adults in your le have over your habits and I think I was lucky to be surrounded by adults who made books available to me and made them fun.’’\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter.

That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
