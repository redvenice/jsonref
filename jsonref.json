I like to think I\u0027m quite handy!\u0027I joined a DIY group on Facebook where I got lots of inspiration from people who were literally just giving cupboards a lick of paint, and it changed the whole room, so I thought I\u0027d give it a go myself.\u0027I also enjoy going around show homes and getting inspiration, and I referred to lots of pictures before I went to Wilkos to get some paint.\u0027With a little painting help from Will and Artie, it took me about six half-days to complete.\u0027During half term last week, Mrs Water\u0027s town was completely cut off, with schools and shops shutting down due to the floods - but luckily her home in particular is situated further from the River Severn, which has burst its banks from heavy downpour.The roads have since been shut off, causing deadlock traffic and her usual ten-minute journey from work now takes 45 minutes.After gutting and cleaning the kitchen to create a fresh canvas, she first took all the cupboards off and sanded them down ready for paint, as before they had a high-gloss finish.She then used sugar soap to rid the cupboards of a thick yellow layer of nicotine, as the previous owner was a smoker, and painted them all with a pot of grey paint from Wilko, costing £12.Mrs Waters bought all the new cupboard handles for just £18 on eBay, and screwed them to each of the ten cupboards and drawers after the paint had dried.To whitewash the once yellow tinged walls and tiles, she used a tin of £8 paint from Wilko, and some white wood paint for the kitchen window.The tiled area around the cooker was created with a £10 roll of vinyl from B\u0026ampQ, which she also used to wrap recycled shelves from the original kitchen.But her main task was finding a use for a particularly strange built-in cupboard, which is placed inside the wall across from the main kitchen units.         ‹ Slide me ›    A little bit of imagination also allowed Mrs Waters to transform this under-used alcove   Mrs Waters said: \u0027There\u0027s a cupboard where the old boiler vent used to be, no one could figure out what it was for when we moved in.\u0027It\u0027s the reason why the professional quotes were so high because if we had it knocked down there would need to be a strong structure put in place to brace the ceiling.\u0027So I just thought, why don\u0027t we turn it into a kitchen cupboard?\u0027I sanded and painted the inside, whitewashed the brick effect wall and added two shelves inside which cost £20 -

Drax’s journey away from coal began some years ago and I’m proud to say we’re going to finish the job well ahead of the government’s 2025 deadline.”He said ending coal burning was “the right decision for our business, our communities and the environment but it will have an impact on some of our employees, which will be difficult for them and their families”.Drax claims to be Europe’s largest decarbonisation project after decades as Britain’s most polluting power plant since it began producing electricity in the 1970s.The power giant is in the process of replacing coal with wood waste pellets – or biomass – and developing carbon capture technology to trap pollution from its flues before it can contribute to global heating.Environmental campaigners have protested against the company’s plans to replace two coal-fired power units with gas-fired units and build a further two gas-fired units on the same site because of fears that the projects will lock the UK into long-term use of fossil fuels.Some green groups have raised questions over whether burning biomass is a sustainable energy source and whether it should be considered “renewable”, despite reports from the company, which it says proves that its US wood pellets are sustainably sourced.Drax earns an estimated £2.1m a day from renewable energy subsidies for its biomass units and has managed to reduce the cost of its biomass. The company reported adjusted earnings of £410m for 2019, up from £250m the year before.Gardiner said by using “sustainable biomass” Drax had “not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK’s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccb593eb63234c001056e6b03b3e7d0534a44804/0_0_5510_3306/master/5510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd2b4e0843aefa1806a844739eb203d6","title":"world bank guyana fossil fuel industry climate","story":"Campaigners say move is ‘blatant contradiction’ of lender’s climate commitmentsThe World Bank has been criticised for providing $55m (£43m) to aid fossil fuel extraction in Guyana, at the same time that it has pledged to stop direct funding of oil and gas production.The Washington-based institution, which provides loans and grants to aid the development of poorer countries, will provide $20m to pay for the training of Guyanese oil and gas officials, including those involved in the marketing of oil.It will also provide $35m to revamp the banking and insurance sectors in the country, in anticipation of the influx of billions of dollars of oil money from new oilfields.The World Bank gained plaudits from environmental groups in 2017 when it pledged to “no longer finance upstream oil and gas” after 2019.However, the pledge allowed it to finance the strengthening of governance and regulation in poorer countries, in the hope of avoiding the so-called resource curse in which oil wealth brings corruption and misuse of money.Campaigners said the World Bank’s focus on the oil and gas sectors clashed with its commitments “to help countries accelerate the transition to sustainable energy” and to support the 2015 Paris agreement goal of keeping global temperature increases to below 2C.“The World Bank’s public assistance to upstream oil development in Guyana is a blatant contradiction to Guyana’s climate change priorities and the bank’s commitment to the Paris climate agreement,” said Heike Mainhardt, a senior advisor at Urgewald, a German non-governmental organisation that has tracked the projects. “I am perplexed by the World Bank’s disregard for its own warning.”Mainhardt said the World Bank’s provision of assistance to the Guyanese government and general budget support allowed it to get around its pledge not to finance upstream oil and gas projects. The country’s rulers were then free to use the money to finance oil development directly, she said.Guyana is expected to become one of the world’s largest oil producers after US firm ExxonMobil, along with the consortium partners Hess and China’s state-owned CNOOC, found sites that could deliver 8bn barrels of oil, including in the offshore Stabroek block.The discovery could prompt massive change for a country of only 800,000 people and less than $5,000 in GDP per person in 2018.The consultancy Rystad Energy this month forecast that Guyana’s oil production could reach 1.2m barrels per day by the end of the decade, lifting total annual oil revenues well above $20bn at current prices.It said government income – projected to be about $270m in 2020 – could reach nearly $10bn annually within a decade, far outstripping Guyana’s 2018 GDP of $3.9bn.Melinda Janki, an international lawyer challenging oil development in Guyana, asked why the World Bank was not funding cheap renewable energy for the country. She said the institution was “pushing Guyana down a financially disastrous development path”.Oil production has become a significant issue in the run-up to Guyana’s election in March, after criticism of the incumbent government run by President David Granger.This month Global Witness, a corruption monitor, said a 40-year deal agreed between the government and ExxonMobil for drilling rights would deprive the country of $55bn. The Guyanese opposition has promised to renegotiate the contracts.A World Bank spokeswoman said: “The World Bank has not provided any financing to develop the Stabroek Block oilfield.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/667385dda2064adebe7f0f0f84eb7b2db8a9d7f5/0_67_5324_3194/master/5324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8785de5455a2d0c387aa75047cec5eea","title":"dying cold europe fuel poverty energy spending","story":"It’s a shocking waste of life in a wealthy society. The Tories must honour their energy spending promisesA society that lets thousands of its citizens die from needless, preventable causes is broken. Every day we wake up to increasingly alarming headlines about coronavirus, but where is the panic about the tens of thousands who are already dying unnecessarily? Britain’s rate of excess winter deaths is twice that of Finland, yet London’s average temperature in January is 10C higher than that of Helsinki.“Excess winter deaths” is a clinical phrase lacking in humanity: it refers to the increased numbers of people sent to their graves in colder months. Such is our damning reality that, when adjusted for seasonal temperature differences, Britain has the worst record in Europe apart from Ireland.Let us be frank. If thousands of people were dying needlessly each year in affluent neighbourhoods and suburbs, wouldn’t this be treated as a national emergency, and wouldn’t action have been taken sooner?Despite the rightful protection of the triple lock on pensions, we still live in a society in which 1.9 million pensioners languish below the poverty line, a statistic that compares harshly with other wealthy, developed nations. How did we end up with such a shameful record?“Britain has the worst housing stock in western Europe in terms of retaining heat and energy efficiency,” E3G’s Pedro Guertler tells me. That has led Britain to be described as the “cold man of Europe”. Here is another dimension of a housing crisis that has deprived millions of people of secure, affordable places to live: one that actually endangers lives. Older people with pre-existing conditions – such as respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular problems – are those most at risk.It is a needless drain on resources and money, too. Solving the crisis would save England’s NHS an estimated £1.36bn. It would also mean fewer patients taking up beds or adding to waiting times in GPs’ surgeries and A\u0026ampE departments. But such has been the false economy of austerity.A public health approach to cold homes makes sense: as NEA’s Peter Smith tells me: “Local authorities have increasingly accepted the link between poor housing and health. If you’ve got a broken boiler and poor insulation, you’ll only wind up in hospital, so it’s better to fix heating or insulation so you can stay in homes longer.”The danger is that we end up with what Smith describes as a “carousel of people with poor health” (typically respiratory or circulatory illnesses) becoming sick and being sent to hospital and then removed quickly because of bed blocking they are then sent back to the very cold conditions that made them ill in the first place. An urgent priority should be to reverse life-destroying cuts to public health. Research by Michael Marmot, director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity, has uncovered other public health consequences, such as mental ill-health and isolation, because pensioners feel unable to invite friends into their cold homes. For years, this crisis has been widely ignored and neglected. When George Osborne was chancellor, he slashed the UK’s key energy efficiency programme, which was specifically aimed at the poorest homeowners. Given the thousands who die from fuel poverty, this alone should be a scandal that follows Osborne to his grave. But there has, finally, been some movement: the Tory manifesto committed to £6.3bn over half a decade on energy efficiency measures to reduce fuel bills in 2.2m homes. Pressure should be exerted on Boris Johnson’s administration to abide by these commitments. The coming budget will be a key test.There’s another priority too: this week, NEA and the Fair by Design movement – which focuses on tackling the “extra costs of being poor” – launched a campaign to defend and extend the warm home discount scheme. The programme provides up to £140 towards energy bills for pensioners, but is at risk of ending in a year’s time. It should be extended to poor working-age families too. As things stand, they have to know if they are eligible, and apply to their supplier each year. And there are limited spaces, meaning up to 2m households could be missing out.There is, of course, room to be more ambitious still. A mass insulation programme for all homes and businesses would create skilled jobs, stimulate the economy, bring down fuel bills, save lives and reduce carbon emissions. Although the government has introduced a partial energy bill cap, prices rose again last year, so there should be urgent action to make them affordable. As the Marmot review on health inequality in England in the last decade uncovered this week, life expectancy has stalled for the first time in over a century for the most deprived women, it has gone backwards. Both austerity and a social order that prioritises money over human lives is to blame. The needless deaths of tens of thousands of people is just one part of the story. We cannot, sadly, go back in time and save them . But we can, and must, demand that the government prevents any more people unnecessarily dying this way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e55ce40725047d062315c11ce76a40595b97be64/0_281_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d409263a19d7c4c56ecdb5249baa01d","title":"how did british indians become so prominent in the conservative party","story":"Last week, the “most Indian cabinet” in British history realised a long-standing dream of the Tory right: the introduction of a purposely cruel “points-based” immigration system. Finally, as many were quick to point out, we saw the limits of “representation politics” laid bare – the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the three other British Indians appointed to Johnson’s cabinet will only embolden Tory racism. But there is a more important story to tell here about how the modern Conservative party came to embrace British Indians – one that runs through Nairobi, Harrow East and occupied Kashmir.Indian migration to Britain took place in two significant waves. The first was in the late 1940s and 50s, when migrants were recruited directly from India by successive governments to fill the labour shortage that resulted from the second world war. They mostly settled in the Midlands and the north-west of England, working in foundries and textile manufacturing. These migrants were heavily involved in building Britain’s antiracist and trade union movements in the 1950s and 60s, drawing on lessons learned from anti-colonial struggles back home to organise their communities in Britain. To this day, these communities are disproportionately working class and Labour voting.The second wave of Indian migrants to Britain were the so-called “twice migrants” who arrived from east Africa in the 1960s and 70s, having been expelled or encouraged to leave by the newly independent regimes in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. The families of our chancellor, home secretary and attorney general are all part of this latter group.So how and why have their descendants become so prominent on the Tory frontbenches? The answer begins in 1895, with the creation of the British East Africa Protectorate. British officials envisioned the protectorate, which occupied roughly the same area as modern-day Kenya, as the “America of the Hindu”, a settler-colonial project to be led by Indians on behalf of the British.In the early 20th century, thousands of Indians (mostly Goans, Gujaratis and Punjabis) were imported into east Africa as subcolonial agents of civilisation. They were required to work in colonial administration and serve in the colonial police and army, to keep the “native peoples” in order. At the same time, more than 30,000 indentured labourers were brought over from India to build the Kenya-Uganda railway.When this group of Indians arrived in Britain, many brought with them the considerable wealth they had accrued (along with a hostility towards black Africans). Others brought with them the benefits of English-language education. These advantages virtually guaranteed the economic success of east African Indians in Britain, especially in the retail businesses of Margaret Thatcher’s “enterprise economy”, for which they soon became known. Rishi Sunak’s pharmacist mother and Priti Patel’s newsagent-owning parents were typical of their generation.The Conservative leadership of the time identified this demographic as potential voters. From the 1980s onwards, the Tories began to court an imagined “Indian community”, limited to east African Indians who had settled around London. Successful British Indians were held up as evidence of what could be achieved under a free-market Conservative government. In 1988, Thatcher welcomed the new Indian high commissioner to Britain with the following words: “We so much welcome the resourceful Indian community here in Britain. You have brought the virtues of family, of hard work and of resolve to make a better life … you are displaying splendid qualities of enterprise and initiative, which benefit not just you and your families but the Indian community and indeed the nation as a whole.”The Tories have now managed to extend their appeal beyond the “two time” migrants by finding common cause in a project of Islamophobia. Supported by the Indian government and its far-right ruling party, the BJP, the Conservatives have exploited a sharp rise in Hindu nationalism within the British Indian community to play Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Muslim communities off against one another. Seventy years after India liberated itself from colonial rule, the old colonial tactics of ide and rule continue to govern Indians in the metropole. Overcoming this is not an impossible task. However, the relative ease with which we Indians in Britain have found ourselves in this situation should be of serious concern. That the latest expansion of Britain’s punitive border regime can be drawn up and legitimised by the sons and daughters of migrants reveals the limits of an antiracist discourse that claims a common “lived experience” as the grounds for political action.Our community’s history of antiracist struggle in Britain can show us another way to confront these issues. When Indian migrants first arrived in Britain in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, they joined forces with recently arrived African-Caribbean migrants to form a unified “black” community of resistance. They responded to state neglect, racial violence and racist policing with a range of radical self-help initiatives, run through organisations such as the United Coloured People’s Alliance, the Black Liberation Front and the British Black Panther Movement. This is a story of community and class solidarity based on shared resistance. It should be recovered to prepare us for the fight ahead.• Neha Shah is an activist and researcher at the University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20000371a14ebc827f3c477f0445caae333dbc5f/0_269_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba0830ece45b39166f5357f1329865d8","title":"keir starmer british bernie sanders labour leadership","story":"Keir Starmer wants to emulate Bernie Sanders by building a erse coalition. But it won’t be easyWhich Labour leadership candidate has most in common with Bernie Sanders? Few of the Democratic presidential candidate’s admirers on the British left would say the answer was Keir Starmer. Yet that is precisely the comparison the favourite for the Labour leadership wants 580,000 members and supporters to make as they begin to cast their ballots this week. In an implicit rebuke to Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey, Starmer says he is not just in the business of uniting a fractured party at Westminster, but broadening its base in the country. Cultivating new support across class and ethnic ides has put Sanders on the road to the Democratic nomination, and Starmer believes that the same approach can put Labour back on the path to power: keep left, rebuild a erse coalition of voters, and look beyond the red wall.Unsurprisingly, Rebecca Long-Bailey’s camp does not agree. With voting under way, the shadow business secretary’s supporters on the left are doing all they can to convince members that Starmer is precisely the opposite sort of politician to Sanders and, by implication, Jeremy Corbyn. Last week, Ian Lavery, the Labour chairman, was deployed by Long-Bailey’s stuttering campaign to needle Starmer in the pages of the Sunday Times. He posed a simple question: who funds you? “All candidates should be comfortable disclosing the source of campaign donations prior to the ballot papers being sent out so that members can cast their votes in full knowledge of their candidate’s funding,” he said. Speaking at the Oxford Union last night, Unite’s Len McCluskey warned Starmer that “financiers lurking in the shadows” had no place in the Labour party.Other Long-Bailey supporters have been even more explicit. Novara Media paint Starmer as the inheritor of a “shifty, evasive” Labour right tradition. As ballots went out on Monday, meanwhile, the Fire Brigades Union released a video that reminded members in no uncertain terms of his resignation from the front bench at the height of the coup against Corbyn in 2016. Unite’s Len McCluskey, who was more than happy to make life difficult for Ed Miliband, the last Labour leader whose politics erged from his own, has said only Long-Bailey can be trusted to guard Labour’s values.Yet anyone watching the woman herself on stage with Starmer at a hustings could be forgiven for assuming a case of mistaken identity: their clashes have been comradely and convivial, the disagreements confined to policy, the personal relationship clearly one of genuine warmth. Each says they will appoint the other to their shadow cabinet. And while Long-Bailey has gone further than Starmer in throwing red meat to the Corbynite left on the issues that animate it most, like mandatory reselection of MPs, there has been very little substantive disagreement on the big question of where the party goes next. Give or take differences of style and emphasis, both have the same answer: travel in the same direction as Jeremy Corbyn (when it comes to domestic policy, at least).That’s precisely why all the available evidence suggests Starmer is going to win, and win relatively easily. Long-Bailey was earmarked as the candidate of continuity Corbynism years before this leadership election was even called, but it is Starmer who has really owned that mantle. Labour members did not vote for Corbyn in overwhelming numbers twice because they were all entirely at one with him ideologically, but because he was the best at communicating the values that the selectorate cared most about, chief among them full-throated opposition to austerity.Yet that isn’t to say Starmer has nothing to worry about, even if attacks such as these are unlikely to derail a campaign that – given most members vote early – might well have already won. What sets Long-Bailey apart is not ideological continuity but institutional continuity: in Unite, Momentum, the smaller, more radical trades unions, and the ecosystem of new left media outlets, she is sustained by the same interests and power-brokers that sustained Corbyn’s internal hegemony for so long. While they won’t prevent Starmer bringing that era to a close, their shift to attack mode does offer a glimpse of the internal resistance that awaits him should his leadership deliver what so many on the left expect: compromise and disappointment.• Patrick Maguire is a political correspondent at the New Statesman"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a061d2df96aa806871a2288d9e0ca00d07f2a08/0_321_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cffd58ee937eec1f4bd2366ef41bf78d","title":"tv debates brexit bbc centre ground leavers remainers","story":"As someone who was behind the camera, briefing presenters and booking guests, it has been interesting to see the BBC’s coverage of current affairs and politics put under scrutiny.Political broadcasts often operate with only a single day’s preparation: issues arise in the news, suitable guests are immediately pitched and briefs are drawn up for presenters. But during the past few years this process has become increasingly haphazard as the number of credible political voices diminished with every passing week. The main reason for this is, of course, the all-pervasive issue of Brexit.Traditionally, Westminster voices in opposition are only too glad to comment on the misdeeds of the incumbent party. But Brexit, especially during Theresa May’s administration, cast a strange spell on party politics. To comment publicly on May’s deal was to implicitly reveal one’s attitude towards Brexit. Very few MPs could afford to alienate one half of the leaveremain ide and even if their constituency might have permitted it, their party whip might not.As such, the task of the political producer – to drum up panels of relevant and interested politicians for public debate – became almost impossible. Broadly speaking, there were only two types of guests for producers to choose from: Brexiteer evangelists or slick and power-hungry London remainers. That the discussion surrounding Brexit should be conducted from these two extremes has become accepted as a sort of national truth, but it certainly doesn’t reflect the real make-up of parliament or the country.A large portion of blame for this disappearing act falls at the feet of the politicians, who effectively empty-chaired themselves. But the BBC played its own anxiety-laden part in the confusion too.Under the leadership of director general Tony Hall there has been a commendable focus on balanced viewpoints on all political shows. Gone are the days of all-male panels discussing a crisis at a female refugee detention centre. But the manner in which this ersification was put in place by production staff swiftly descended into farce. A whiteboard would be marked up with a clumsy grid system. The grid would revolve around a set of key identities such as “woman”, “northern” or “poc” (person of colour). These would then be cross-categorised with political stances such as “Brexiteer”, “Tory” or “progressive”. Our task would then be to ensure that any proposed panel contained a complete balance of all these attributes.On daily programmes, where a different panel needed to be booked five days a week, these grid meetings often descended into the sort of charade that certain rightwing columnists dream about. One notable incident came when in order to find an “authentic” northern voice, all plausible interviewees who displayed any obvious erudition were vetoed. In their place, newspaper owner Danny Lockwood was slotted into the identity sudoku, as his tone was seen to more directly signal his real northern identity. Several producers thought fit to mention that said inidual was, in fact, a reactionary whose past achievements include mocking the “Zorro” outfits worn by some Muslim women. But the grids didn’t have any disqualifying categories.Ironically, the main beneficiary of this combination of a grid-based representation and self-imposed Brexit omertà was the European Research Group. High-profile or cabinet politicians can only be reached via power-hungry special advisers and professional press teams. The ERG, on the other hand, has no press agents at all and was very happy to provide the “leave” voice that the grid demands. The sheer number of times Mark Francois was booked over the last year boggles the mind.There is an understandable nervousness about criticising these sorts of editorial practices since it might provide material for the reactionary commentariat who have no desire to see any erse voices in journalism at all. But there is no easy way around the obvious complications caused by this approach. As the grid became the be-all and end-all of programming in some shows, all other ways of thinking about politics went out the window. The sectarian ision of Brexit was taken at face value and guests contributed to a culture of reinforcing this schism rather than trying to understand or interrogate it.It should be noted that this open approach to booking guests does not apply to BBC hiring practices or indeed attitudes towards its own staff. The bulk of its news operations are still dominated by white Oxbridge-educated men of a certain age, and the treatment of young producers and researchers can be questionable at best. One female producer told me that when she reported rape threats shouted at her by far-right activists outside parliament, she was simply told it was “part of her job”.And when we were able to cajole a bigger name on to a show – I’ve been told by several producers that they were instructed to use powers of flirtation more than of negotiation – there was always a boozy familiarity between presenters, writers and MPs that demonstrated the perils of establishment thinking. A handful of MPs, deeply entrenched in London’s literary and intellectual circles, treat the BBC like a university common room. By default these iniduals are remainers. To continue booking them (drinking with them), the production staff must then secure the presence of their leave-voting, far-right opposition. Off-camera, a highly influential Westminster social circle revolves around trips to various holiday homes in continental Europe, where various MPs and the journalists who are supposed to report on them have long been playing just as hard as they work.Work in British politics is hard – and has been doubly so over the last few years – so it is understandable that an embattled solidarity develops between the press and the objects of their scrutiny. Without those parties on the Mediterranean I’m sure that many stories and interviews wouldn’t have materialised. But it is hard to stomach the ceaseless talk of impartial, representative journalism when the content of our shows frequently depends on which London politician fancies a drink after work.The ideas behind Hall’s ersity drive were worthwhile: first, it could be presented as a solution to the establishment liberalism that had so badly failed to predict the conditions that fuelled Brexit at the same time, it was intended to address the historic imbalances of class and race that still mar so much modern political reporting. In the end Hall’s initiative was a solution to neither problem. While the BBC was busy failing to change its structures and work practices with whiteboards, the most complex and unorthodox period of politics in a generation simply blew past – despite the considerable airtime given to it – the one group of people who were most trusted to shine a light on it.• The author is a journalist who has worked for the BBC.

The measures are expected to be enshrined in the country’s wildlife protection law later this year.The ban is a swift response to the Covid-19 outbreak, thought to have originated in wildlife sold at a market in Wuhan, Hubei province in early December.However, the Shenzhen government’s potential ban on dog and cat meat is framed not as part of an effort to reduce disease transmission, but as an aspect of the special relationship between people and pets, which it has called the “consensus of all human civilisation”. “Shenzhen might just be able to do it, as it is a progressive city in many ways,” said Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and expert on animal protection in China. “I really hope so.”Consumption of dog and cat meat is most common in Shenzhen’s home province of Guangdong, neighbouring Guangxi, and parts of north-east China, though it is not universally practised across the country and has become less acceptable over time. Taiwan outlawed the consumption of dog and cat meat in 2017.“Dog eating has become increasingly controversial in China, with frequent violent clashes between dog thieves and angry dog owners,” said Wendy Higgins, director of international media at Humane Society International (HSI).“There is a growing and vocal Chinese opposition to the dog and cat meat trade, and young people in China are far more likely to think of dogs as companions than cuisine,” she said.The draft regulation is now in a public comment phase running until 5 March and no timeline has been given for the final determination.If the ban goes through, other animals identified as potentially carrying disease – such as turtles, snakes, some birds and insects – could be included on a list of prohibited animals for consumption in line with national rules that are expected in the coming months.Under the Shenzhen ban, fines for serving banned animals at restaurants would range from 20,000 to 200,000 yuan (£2,200–£22,000).HSI has estimated that between 10 and 20 million dogs are killed in China for their meat annually, while protection group Animals Asia puts the figure for cats at roughly 4 million a year.“The vast majority of dogs caught up in the trade in China are stolen pets and strays snatched from the streets,” Higgins said. “After being stolen or snatched, the animals are crammed in small cages in their hundreds, unable to move, and piled on the back of trucks, packed so tightly they can break limbs.”Animal protection groups have long been concerned with practices used in the dog meat trade, from rearing and theft to transport and slaughter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90c6f5305c93c5e2f6cc93af7b97a4f87c7a73ee/0_0_5177_3106/master/5177.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5004f3b25a333d594cab1f0d00d2b61","title":"underwater photographer of the year 2020 winners in pictures","story":"All the winning images, all the backstories and all the judges’ comments can be found in the The Underwater Photographer of the Year Yearbook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d46093ebaace5ad0b70ae7ce2ac224d5d1f2ef7b/0_0_4441_2665/master/4441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91dde45b840df1fdf68e00514da68269","title":"earl cave i can do angsty teenager but i think i was pretty pleasant","story":"Nick Cave’s son was first seen on screen in a pair of intimate documentaries. Now, family tragedy has inspired him to ‘make something beautiful’ in his acting careerEarl Cave’s first on-screen appearance was in the 2014 music documentary 20,000 Days on Earth: Earl and his twin, Arthur, are sitting at home in school uniform either side of their father, the musician Nick Cave. All three are eating pizza and watching Scarface. The boys are 13.“Films were a huge part of my childhood,” says Cave. “Inappropriate movie night was once a week and my dad would show us ungodly, outrageous films. We were obsessed with getting as scared as possible.“We weren’t interested in the acting or directing. It was just: ‘Fuck, let’s get the goriest film. Put on Chucky 3 and eat some popcorn.’”Cave is now 19, lean and long haired, with big eyes. When he gently gesticulates with his ringed fingers, the resemblance to his father is impossible to deny.Next month, Cave will be on screen as other people in two films. True History of the Kelly Gang is a bloody jaunt across 19th-century Australia with notorious bushranger Ned Kelly, directed by Justin Kurzel (Snowtown, Macbeth). Days of the Bagnold Summer, meanwhile, is an adaptation by Simon Bird (The Inbetweeneers, Friday Night Dinner) of a graphic novel about domestic ennui in Bromley.He has not been acting long, but his turns so far have been striking. His role as Frodo, the hyperactive petrol station attendant in The End of the F***ing World, prompted BuzzFeed articles, fan videos and endless memes. “People were calling themselves Fro-hos,” says Cave. “Apparently I was the Fro-daddy. It was surreal.”As Daniel – brother of Ned – Kelly, Cave careers through the outback plastered in warpaint, wielding a gun and wearing a full-length wedding gown. The film is a punk rock spin on the outlaw’s story and as a bonding exercise for the cast, Kurzel even had them form a band.“He totally sprung it on us,” says Cave. “We turned up for pre-production and he said: ‘You’re starting a band, we’ve booked you a gig, go and write songs.’” It worked, though: “The idea of us against the world, sticking together and if anyone gets in our way then fuck ’em.” The makeshift band’s tunes feature on the soundtrack, and an album of ramshackle garage folk-punk is potentially on the cards. Still, says Cave, they were “kind of shit. We didn’t have much time, we just bashed it out my bass sounds dreadful.”In Bagnold Summer, meanwhile, he is a sullen grump with an all-black wardrobe and Metallica attached to his ears. It is a more subtle and low-key performance, steeped in hormonal stubbornness, to which Cave brings surprising tenderness and grace.“I can do angsty teenager and wild teenager,” he grins. Was he either? “I was pretty pleasant. I think I was a bit of a dickhead around 15 I started to dress horrendously. I’d wear leggings, spray-on jeans, and then sag them around my backside.”If your parents are as immaculate as Nick and his fashion designer wife, Susie, baggy bottoms evidently count as extraordinary rebellion.“I now feel sorry for them having to walk around with me,” he says. “They let me do my thing but were like: ‘Maybe you should try a straight leg?’ And I’d be like: ‘Fuck off, dad, I don’t want to wear a three-piece suit!’”Cave grins at the memory of his teenage sartorial wobbles. But the truth is, during his teenage years, the whole Cave family were faced with an unimaginable tragedy: the death of Earl’s twin, Arthur, aged 15, who fell off a cliff having taken LSD. In the 2016 documentary One More Time With Feeling – Cave’s second screen credit – director Andrew Dominik returns to the household, this time finding it crippled by grief.“Andrew is a family friend, so it didn’t feel intrusive but he did crack into us a bit,” says Cave. “He left me out as he knew I was under a lot of stress. I had a lot of shit going on I had my fucking exams in the middle of all that.”Cave’s brief appearance comes when he visits his father in a recording studio, gently running his fingers through his mother’s hair before the three of them embrace. Despite the film’s rawness, Cave is thankful for it. “It didn’t feel invasive and I don’t know how the hell Andrew did that. It was a beautiful tribute to Arthur.”Cave is hesitant to discuss his twin too much. Photos of the flowers and handwritten note he left at the accident site were shared online, paparazzi were at the inquest, with the media insinuating a lack of parental responsibility from his father.“What happened really changed me,” he says after a pause. “It matured me very quickly at an early age, especially emotionally.“The intense time that I spent with my family, and with all of us nourishing each other, meant we came out of this with a greater knowledge of what it’s like to lose someone. We’ve all come out as very different people but I actually think for the better, which is a difficult thing to say.”Both his parents have explored the grieving process through writing: his father with music and answering fan mail, his mother on her website, the Vampire’s Wife. “They have found their outlets,” says Cave. “These are things that keep you busy and focused but are also a means of answering other people’s questions in a way that answers some questions you might have for yourself.“Film has been really important to me for that,” he says. “I’m doing all of this for Arthur.

Such ambition must surely spur on othersI get to travel around the UK a lot, forever celebrating commercial life outside the big cities. On Monday morning, I found encouragement in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire. It was raining hard on this small former pit town. The last of the collieries closed in 2003 and it has been looking for another purpose ever since. Over the road from Lidl and the police station is a place called Coaltown. It is a huge coffee shop, cafe and roastery, so hip that if you came across it in Hoxton in east London or Manchester’s Northern Quarter you would roll your eyes. Here in Ammanford it looked, at first sight, plain incongruous.Scott James founded it. Sporting a bright red knitted beret thing, he wouldn’t look out of place in Hoxton, either. It was Scott who decided that his home town needed, of all things, an enormous, trendy coffee palace. God only knows how he persuaded anyone to agree with him enough to lend him the money to buy a vast derelict coalshed next to the railway and turn it into this unexpected masterpiece. Scott hopes that coffee can take the place of anthracite as the black gold powering the town. He speaks of creating a new industry, training and employing local people in the business. The punters come from far and wide to hang out, eat the food, drink the coffee and smell the beans roasting. It’s a beautiful space.Yes, as a nation, we probably have enough coffee shops. And the best coffee business east of St Davids is not going to turn a town around on its own. But there is something magnificent about the ambition, and where it could lead. Many a local will surely look at the success of Coaltown and think: well, if this kind of place can work here, then anything can I’ll give something a try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc5caf983c2272af8454b5920e19d9d849ccf0c/0_498_5416_3249/master/5416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553dbdb789de36b59b8b250bf6e57868","title":"finnish fa drops womens prefix for league in push for equality","story":"The top ision of women’s football in Finland has announced that it will change its name from Women’s League to National League (Kansallinen Liiga) in the latest move to implement “full equality” in running the country’s football.The Finnish FA last year become one of only a few organisations in world football who have equal pay for their men’s and women’s national teams, and on Thursday it revealed the latest step in its three-year plan.“Last summer’s Women’s World Cup proved that people do not base their interest in football on the gender of the players,” said Ari Lahti, president of the Finnish FA. “People come to the games to see top athletes play quality football.

And yet even within that irony there are deeper ironies, the suspicion that a great European performance may not actually have been necessary, the suggestion that Pep Guardiola’s true opponent was less the 11 men in different coloured shirts than himself, and the realisation that good as City were, this Real Madrid are deeply ordinary, little more than the memory of a team despite their branding.But who knows what strange process of attrition can undo a team? Who knows what demons may be raised by finding yourself thwarted at every turn by an opponent playing in a way that was entirely unexpected so that you, the most successful team in the competition’s history, end up chugging around fruitlessly at home in front of a crowd that, even at 1-0 up, was audibly restless? Just because Madrid collapsed in the final 17 minutes after Raheem Sterling came on doesn’t mean they necessarily would have been susceptible to him from the off, before Dani Carvajal had been run into the ground by Gabriel Jesus, who produced a supremely disciplined performance on the left before shifting into the middle to equalise then end Sergio Ramos’s tie.Which is not a criticism – or at least not of Guardiola or City. Games are won and lost on many fronts and one of them is within a team or a manager’s own psyche. Guardiola bears the scars of European ties lost to soft goals conceded, often in clutches: to Real Madrid in 2014, to Barcelona in 2015, to Monaco in 2017, to Liverpool in 2018, to Tottenham last season. Just as Alex Ferguson accepted after the defeat by Madrid in the quarter-final in 2000 that it’s not enough to be better than the opponent, you also have to take risk out of the equation as far as possible, so Guardiola did everything to ensure there would be no sudden two- or three-goal blast against his side.And in a sense the formation he adopted represented a reversion to first principles. After his Bayern had lost 4-1 at Wolfsburg in January 2015, Guardiola blamed himself and wrote what he called his bible on a whiteboard in his office. It was a very short bible, containing just three key strictures. He would deploy:This is how you achieve the key aim of post-Cruyffianism, as set out in his 2001 memoir La meva gent, el meu futbol: “to fill the centre of the pitch in order to play having numerical superiority.” Against a 4-3-3, then, unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise, you field a 4-4-2 – even if it’s an unorthodox interpretation of that shape, featuring a centre-forward on the left of midfield and two midfielders playing as false nines.City perhaps lost some counterattacking fluency by fielding Kevin De Bruyne so high and there were a couple of early long balls to nobody, but that supremacy in midfield was achieved and, broadly speaking, City had control, other than a couple of crosses and Isco’s goal, which was the result of three inidual errors – which can be mitigated but never entirely eliminated by the tactical framework.That such care probably wasn’t necessary against such a limited Madrid is neither provable nor, really, City’s issue: win the game, move on, let the opposition worry about their problems. But Madrid really were dreadful, lacking energy or inspiration, even worse than Barcelona had been away to Napoli on Tuesday.In fact other than Bayern and City, none of the superclubs played well in the first legs of their last-16 ties. Liverpool can be expected to improve but there are major problems elsewhere, some to do with transition, some that run far deeper than that. And that really is what is so repellant about the superclub era, even if the money came from the purest of sources and was spent in scrupulous observance of financial fair play regulations: it means clubs such as Madrid and Barcelona can be run staggeringly badly with no real consequence, their wealth and status sustaining them so they can come back for another large slice of the pie the following year.With so many of the giants stuttering, the competition feels unusually open this year. City would have been among the favourites even before Wednesday’s suggestion that they have developed a new edge, a less risky means of playing. This, at last, could be their year. And with the ban looming, that would be the greatest irony of all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f1b00ef08dbfa0bf2abbebeb6506421e9a04666/0_431_6457_3874/master/6457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b29f3b3653a877ccc7d1095387653081","title":"james newman my last breath uk eurovision entry","story":"With his unremarkable blend of Lewis Capaldi, Mumford \u0026amp Sons and Coldplay, Newman is unlikely to trouble the Republic of Macedonia on the leaderboardOnly a demented optimist doesn’t feel a sense of hopelessness overwhelm them as the UK’s entry for Eurovision 2020 appears. In fairness to James Newman, the feeling overwhelms you before you actually hear My Last Breath.Eurovision was never exactly a source of national pride – not even the most swivel-eyed, sunlit-uplands jingoist would attempt to elicit a surge of nostalgic patriotism by mentioning the Brotherhood of Man wowing the foreigners with Save All Your Kisses for Me – but it’s turned into an annual national humiliation. There’s no point blaming resentment about Brexit: we last won 23 years ago. We haven’t even made the Top 10 since 2009, a minor success that was wiped out the following year when nobody at all voted for the UK’s entry. Our latter-day lot at Eurovision is to end up in the chastening low 20s.Various explanations have been mooted, including conspiracy theories about geographical voting. The truth is that we haven’t sent a memorable song in decades: try and hum the chorus of Joe and Jake’s You’re Not Alone (No 24, 2016), or Michael Rice’s Bigger Than Us (No 26, 2019). The problem is that we don’t really care. For some nations, Eurovision provides the solitary bit of widespread exposure their native pop music gets, which isn’t the case for the UK. Or at least we don’t care until we lose, and then we clamber on the sideboard and start angrily bellowing Rule, Britannia! and shouting that it’s all a fix.Is My Last Breath going to change this? Probably not. It’s a serviceable song that nods to the earnest post-Ed Sheeran acoustic troubadours exemplified by Lewis Capaldi and to the tub-thumping folksiness of Mumford \u0026amp Sons’ debut album the chorus throws in some Coldplay-ish massed “woah-oh”ing. You can see the logic: these artists represent three of Britain’s most successful musical exports of recent years. My Last Breath wouldn’t sound out of place on the Radio 2 playlist – but nor would it stand out on the Radio 2 playlist. The hook is OK, rather than indelible.The main sense of intrigue about My Last Breath comes from the man singing it: Newman has a successful career as a songwriter, having been employed by Jess Glynne, Little Mix and Rudimental. You look at his track record and think: you’re doing pretty well, so why are you doing this? Why would you want to subject yourself to what is almost inevitably going to happen on 16 May in Rotterdam? Do you think this is the song to turn our fortunes around? Or are you possessed of some crazed, masochistic desire to give a succession of brave smiles to camera and half-heartedly wave a little union jack on a stick as Bosnia-Herzegovina give the UK a desultory deux points and we’re left for dust on the leaderboard by the Republic of Macedonia?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcb8db35bb5d141414e0699d49ddae994617942f/0_462_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa03b22d2961c05fe7d10c042891ff48","title":"could coronavirus be china chernobyl moment podcast","story":"The coronavirus crisis engulfing China is the biggest political test yet for Xi Jinping. ’s Lily Kuo looks at how it may become an economic crisis.

Nigel Farage’s Brexit party raised £7.15m, but failed to win a seat.In 2019, political parties in Great Britain reported accepting more than £113,119,000 in donations, the largest value ever reported in one year. This is almost £40mmore than in 2017, the year with the previous largest value of donations.In the fourth quarter of 2019, 14 political parties registered in the UK reported £70,113,414 in donations and public funds – the biggest amount since records began.Money that has flown into the Tories over 12 weeks to 31 December includes more than £3.2m from the JCB-linked companies owned by the family of the Brexiter billionaire Lord Bamford.During the campaign, Johnson memorably drove one of their diggers through a wall of polystyrene bricks as he promised to break the EU deadlock and “get Brexit done”.Payments include three donations worth £2.3m from JC Bamford Excavators as well as another £900,000 from JCB Services.Three £1m donations came from Brexiter businessman Peter Hargreaves, the theatre magnate John Gore and Bridgemere UK, a property company chaired by former Redrow boss Steve Morgan.Another property company which specialises in building leasehold homes, JS Bloor (Services), gave the party £750,000.The Tories received a £500,000 gift in two tranches from Ann R Said in November, the data shows. She is the wife of Syrian-born former arms dealer Wafic Said who cannot donate because he is tax resident in Monaco.Fund managers and City investors have returned to the party under Johnson, following some nervousness about the stability of Theresa May’s government.Michael Spencer’s investment vehicle IPGL gave the Tories £500,000 in December.The pulling power of the Conservatives was demonstrated this week at the lavish Black and White ball held in Battersea, south London.A document leaked to the  showed that the fundraising event on Tuesday was organised by a committee that includes the Carphone Warehouse founder, David Ross, who called in a favour to provide the prime minister and his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, with a free holiday in Mustique over the new year.Jay Rutland, the Essex businessman whose wife is the socialite Tamara Ecclestone, is also on the list of organisers. He previously worked in the financial sector in the City of London but in 2012 was banned from trading over “market abuse”.Around 700 people, paying £15,000 for a table of eight, attended the Conservatives’ winter party. According to the Sun, Lubov Chernukhin, who is married to a former ally of Vladimir Putin, paid £45,000 to pay tennis with the prime minister.She is a regular donor to the party and has previously paid to have dinner with the then defence secretary Gavin Williamson and to spend an evening with Theresa May.The single biggest donation in the run-up to the election was made by Lord Sainsbury, the former chairman of Sainsbury’s, who gave £8m to the Liberal Democrats.Labour’s biggest donors were unions, with Unite giving £3.5m, Unison £741,000 and Usdaw £500,000.

Scientists then amplify genetic material called RNA in the samples and look for sections that match the virus’s RNA. The test takes 24 to 48 hours. Once the result is available it is sent back to the clinician who informs the person whether they tested positive or not.People who have recently returned from any of the northern Italian towns that are under containment should self-isolate, whether or not they have symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, or fever. They should stay at home, inform NHS 111 of their travel details, and await advice for further assessment or testing.There are 10 affected towns in the Lombardy region of Italy, namely Codogno, Castiglione d’Adda, Casalpusterlengo, Fombio, Maleo, Somaglia, Bertonico, Terranova dei Passerini, Castelgerundo and San Fiorano, and one in the Veneto region, Vo’ Euganeo. The same guidance goes for any travellers returning from Wuhan city and Hubei province in China, Iran, and Daegu and Cheongdo in South Korea.Schools are issuing specific advice if they suspect pupils may be infected. If you believe your child has contracted the virus through a different route, call NHS 111 for advice.In addition to the areas above, Public Health England has drawn up a list of 14 regions. Travellers returning from these areas should self-isolate if they develop coronavirus symptoms. These are Cambodia, the rest of China, other areas of Italy north of Florence and Pisa, Hong Kong, Japan, Laos, Macau, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. People returning home from these parts do not need to self-isolate if they do not have coronavirus symptoms.Travel to most European destinations is unaffected, but this may change as the virus spreads. So far, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against all but essential travel to the Italian towns that are in isolation to contain the virus, but has not imposed restrictions on other parts of Europe. The Association of British Insurers has put out information on the implications for travel insurance. If you travel against government advice, you are likely to invalidate your insurance.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.Go and enjoy yourself. The only area government advises people to avoid completely because of coronavirus is Hubei, the Chinese province where the virus first emerged. It advises against all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China and to the cities of Daegu and Cheongdo in South Korea. Travellers to some parts of Asia may face screening on arrival, and many have imposed restrictions on people who have recently been in China or other affected countries. Officials may deny entry or require people to be quarantined. If you have holiday plans and are concerned about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, talk to your airline or travel company. The situation is moving fast, so for the latest travel guidance see the Public Health England and Foreign and Commonwealth Office websites.People who need to self-isolate should stay at home except when they need medical care. They must avoid work, school, public areas and not use public transport or taxis until told it is safe for them to do so. The person should stay in a separate, well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened. Ideally, they should use a separate bathroom, but if this is not possible, consider a bathroom rota where the isolated person washes and bathes last and then, if they are well enough, cleans the facilities thoroughly. They should use separate towels from others in the household. Everyone should follow basic hygiene rules: wash your hands, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when you cough or sneeze, and put used tissues in the bin immediately.Anyone who fears they have contracted the virus should call NHS 111 as a first port of call. They will assess what you need to do, decide whether you need a test, and if so, where you can go for one. The NHS has begun to pilot home testing for coronavirus in London, so if you have symptoms, you may not need to travel to get tested."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc82b781314d61a1327f789ed67678ce45a67aac/0_104_2708_1625/master/2708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=343889155c1c42abcdee58e81cdfe2f3","title":"australia ease to 86 run win over bangladesh at women t20 world cup","story":"The Australian women’s team finally put in a performance befitting their home-favourite status at the Twenty20 World Cup with an 86-run win, although it came at the expense of an under-resourced and overwhelmed Bangladesh team.The opening bats Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney took control from the outset, piling up an Australian record partnership for the format with 151 runs. Australia finished on 189 for one with Healy the only wicket to fall for 83 from 53 balls, while Mooney batted through the innings for 81 from 58. Bangladesh were never in the hunt, with some late run-outs reducing them to 103 for nine.For Australia it was a welcome night of everything going smoothly, after an opening-round stumble against India had been followed by nearly dropping another game to Sri Lanka in a nervous and unconvincing display in Perth.But after the captain, Meg Lanning, won the toss and chose to bat in an evening match in Canberra, Australia never looked back. The true wicket and fast outfield at Manuka Oval suits big scores, and for a while it looked like Healy and Mooney would knock off the tournament record of 169 that England’s Heather Knight and Natalie Sciver had set against Thailand only the day before.Healy set the tone with four boundaries in her first eight balls, regularly lashing through a strong off-side field against the opening bowlers before starting to advance and hit down the ground against the spinners. By the eighth over she had raised a half-century by launching her third six of the innings, all from the unfortunate Khadija Tul Kubra, to the pleasure of a crowd in excess of 5,600.For a few overs Mooney took the lead, advancing to loft drives down the ground and over cover, moving to her own 50 after some desperate bat-swinging saved her from a stumping off Rumana Ahmed on 47. On they went until the end of the 17th over.A century for Healy wasn’t to be, the opener reaching for a wide ball from Salma Khatun but lifting the spinner to Sanjida Islam at point. That wasn’t much salve for the burn, though, as Ashleigh Gardner came out to help loot the wicket-taker’s final over for 16, thanks in large part to Nahida Akter parrying a possible catch for six, leaving Khatun with a night’s work of one for 39.Gardner finished with 22 from nine deliveries, the perfect job with so few balls to spare. A battered Bangladesh team managed to find enough composure that Shamima Sultana and Murshida Khatun held out the opening salvoes, but Australia’s swing expert Megan Schutt got them both in the fourth over, including a dream delivery that coasted in from wide over the wicket to take the former’s leg stump.Fargana Hoque batted through to the penultimate over for 36, taking a particular liking to the bowling of Annabel Sutherland with some fine straight drives, but Sutherland picked up a wicket at the other end, as did Nicola Carey and Jess Jonassen.Schutt returned to have Fargana Hoque caught behind with her last ball of the night, then the 20th over saw a team hat-trick with another Jonassen wicket and two run-outs. Bangladesh survived the final ball to make it through the innings with a triple-figure score and without having been bowled out, but that was where the positives ended.Bangladesh’s tournament is now all but over, winless with two matches to play, while Australia could still be knocked out at the pool stage if they lose to New Zealand on Monday. Their net run rate, though, got a huge boost from the Bangladesh win, taking them well ahead on that front after the Kiwis lost to India earlier the same day.“We weren’t really focused on that other game today at any point,” said Healy after play. “There was a bit of talk about it on the bus before we arrived, but it was always going to happen, both pools are really wide open at the minute, and there’s probably going to be three sides that are pushing for the top two. To get that result tonight was fantastic against a side that’s really unknown to us. It probably allowed us to think about ourselves for a chance and just get out there and play how we wanted to.”The word “unknown” was not dismissive. This was the first time Australia and Bangladesh had played in any form of women’s cricket. The Bangladesh men last visited Australia for a Test tour in 2003, when Steve Waugh was captaining Australia, and a one-day tour in 2008. One of the biggest financial players in world cricket should be doing more to assist the game’s future in Bangladesh, where the next generation of boys has just won the Under-19 World Cup.For today though, those in the halls of power would have had eyes trained on their own affairs. Their women’s team is out of the hole it dug. The New Zealand game remains a must-win, but at least the Australians are in charge of what happens next, rather than facing a chance of being squeezed out by other results. The quest for a huge crowd at the final is still alive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8437efd7f44c118ad38498f4d555a0738f642555/0_0_4461_2678/master/4461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee601e48eeb389a0d7331f999aa57a45","title":"wind ice hockey fairytales celebrating against old club classic youtube","story":"This week’s roundup also features a 94-foot putt to win a car, plus: an unusual method of tackling from Macedonia1) Sport’s easier with the wind on your side. Witness Justin Gatlin mauling Usain Bolt’s 100m world record with a run of 9.45secs … albeit with a massive fan behind him for a Japanese TV show, raising the wind reading to 8.9 ms. That’s almost four and a half times the legal limit (for comparison, Bolt’s mark of 9.58 was set with a wind of 0.9 ms behind him). Speaking of 100m, that’s the distance Barrow’s Jamie Dallimore managed with a goalline drop-out in the Challenge Cup with assistance from Storm Dennis behind him. It left London Skolars having to drop out themselves, in the other direction (spoilers: theirs didn’t go 100m) …Back to athletics, various competitors enjoyed a stiff breeze behind them, with triple jumpers Willie Banks (1988, 18.06m) and Jonathan Edwards (1995, 18.43m), while Carl Lewis threw in a wind-assisted 8.91m before Mike Powell replied with something longer and more legal in the greatest long jump competition of all time at the 1991 world championships. Arbroath’s Colin Hamilton used the elements to put Roberto Carlos-like whip on a corner – however the match against Ayr was abandoned at half-time with the scores at 1-1 due to the high winds.

It now has 1,500 runnersBy Jonathan Drennan for the  Sport NetworkFor many years the Irish journalist Graham Clifford travelled the world, reporting from refugee camps and charting the often perilous journeys of asylum seekers to Europe. For all the time and energy he put into his newspaper and radio reports, he ultimately felt unable to make a lasting difference. That changed in the unlikely setting of Dungarvan, a coastal town in County Waterford, where Clifford struck upon an idea that would have a positive, long-lasting impact on the asylum seekers in his own community.“I would never say that I am a natural runner, but I found myself in this 10-mile race in Dungarvan,” explains Clifford. “I say race, but I was just trying to keep going. When you’re going through these runs, you find yourself with time to think and, as I was doing the race, I looked around at the other runners and the community, and just thought: ‘I wonder, could I do something with running to make new arrivals to our country feel that bit more welcome?’ It was a very rough idea but I couldn’t stop thinking about it.”By the time Clifford made it home to Fermoy in County Cork that evening, the genesis of an idea had come to him. He would set up the Sanctuary Runners, a group that would give asylum seekers a place to meet Irish people in an informal environment. Clifford founded the group not as a political statement, but with three words in mind: solidarity, friendship and respect.“When you think about it, running is beautiful in its simplicity. It’s a physical activity you can do with few limitations that can help you build friendships quite easily. In the early days, I provided posters for people living in Direct Provision centres, telling them that they were welcome.”“Slowly but surely, people came. Many of them had never spoken to an Irish person before in an informal way as a friend. It had only been a transactional thing, whether at the centre where they lived or at a government office. We wanted to break down those barriers and build friendships.”Direct Provision centres were established by the Irish government in 1999 to house asylum seekers who were waiting for their applications to be processed. The centres were meant to be a temporary solution, but there are now 6,000 asylum seekers living in 35 centres across the country. Residents come from all over the world – mainly Pakistan, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Albania, Malawi, South Africa, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Syria – and live live together in centres that are often short of space. At least 2,250 of those living in Direct Provision are children.Adults receive a personal allowance of €38.80 per week, with children given €29.80. Life can feel like purgatory, with a third of asylum seekers spending at least three years in the system. Many battle with mental health issues, isolation and a lack of routine beyond leaving their room for meals.Sibusisiwe “Busie” Mhlophe moved to Cork three years ago from Gwanda, a town in the south of Zimbabwe. When she arrived at her first training session with the Sanctuary Runners, she was extremely shy and barely spoke. Prior to joining the club, she had spent her time within the four small walls of her room in the Direct Provision centre, punctuated by short visits outside for meals. She always kept her head down when she made furtive visits outside, scared she would be noticed and looked at. In a year of living in Cork, she had never had an informal, friendly conversation with an Irish person.“I arrived at the first training session really nervous,” she says. “I didn’t know how Irish people would react to me. I always felt people were looking at me like I was different. I felt that people might think that I had no right to be here and wouldn’t want to talk to me as an asylum seeker. I was quiet and had never run before in a group like this. In fact, I had never really run, apart from when I played netball as a young girl.“The group built my confidence and changed my life. I arrived in Ireland with no winter clothes. Irish people in the group took me to get clothes. They picked me up for training sessions and took me to races all over Ireland. What’s most important for us is to build genuine friendships that take place long after we run. They continue throughout the week.”Sanctuary Runners grew quickly, with asylum seekers and Irish people bonding easily over their love of running, coffee and conversation. However, Clifford was not only interested in changing the lives of asylum seekers. He wanted the group to affect the hearts and minds of local people.“One thing I always wanted to do with Sanctuary Runners was not just engage with people who really believed in us from the get-go, but also look to those who might just be that more nervous or hesitant,” he says. “Maybe they had never met an asylum seeker. They didn’t know anything about Direct Provision. They might even be cynical. We wanted to be open to them.“We had a farmer who joined his wife, who had become a member. He was nervous about coming. Well, an hour in, he’s chatting away like old friends with a guy from Pakistan. Weeks after that he invited the whole group back to farmhouse for food and a sing-song. Those are the moments you love, and you realise how running can change things.”When anyone joins Sanctuary Runners, they are given a blue T-shirt. Everyone wears the same clothing to signify that there are no labels: no one is viewed as an Irish person or an asylum seeker. Everyone is part of the group and everyone is equal.“This group has given me so much,” says Muhammad Majid, who arrived in Cork from Pakistan three years ago. “When you arrive in a new country and are struggling with the language, how are you meant to make friends? The group has made it so easy. People come and pick you up and the best part is always the coffee afterwards. That’s when I have learned about Irish culture. They have been nothing other than welcoming for me. Life in Direct Provision can be scary, you’re constantly waiting. Now I don’t worry about waiting, I just look forward to when I am going to run again.”The club competes in races all over Ireland, transporting runners from across the globe to small villages on winding country roads. There is no pressure on the runners to win medals or beat their personal bests. The aim is always the same: to build friendships. This year, the group are planning to take part in the Cork City Marathon with 1,000 Sanctuary Runners all dressed in blue.Majid is now working as a chef in Cork and volunteering with homeless people in the city in his spare time. Mhlophe is studying international development at University College Cork and hopes she will go on to work with the local community she has come to love. Both of them remain committed to Sanctuary Runners. Clifford’s days have never been busier. There are Sanctuary Runners across every corner of Ireland with more than 1,500 runners competing in their blue T-shirts. He has people contacting him from all over the world to start the next Sanctuary Runners.The road to friendship and acceptance in a new country is often long and difficult, but through the simple act of lacing up running shoes, the Sanctuary Runners have made it that bit quicker for hundreds of asylum seekers in Ireland.Jonathan Drennan and The Sanctuary Runners are on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bed32af5d5801744dcf3e1e0131a61091261317d/216_277_4203_2522/master/4203.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac9dce571a9e9d242261dd9cc8a8ad21","title":"cloud gate dance theatre review swirling tales from taiwan","story":"Sadler’s Wells, London Cheng Tsung-lung’s 13 Tongues circles and flows, while Lin Hwai-min’s Dust is a slow slide into the darkForty-seven years ago, a man who knew next to nothing about choreography founded Taiwan’s first professional dance company. Nearly five decades on, Lin Hwai-min is a legend in his native country (50,000 people turned out to see one show last year) creating a distinctive style of movement based on classical, modern and Chinese folk dance, meditation, martial arts and even calligraphy.Only at the end of last year did Lin step down as artistic director, aged 72, passing the mantle to choreographer Cheng Tsung-lung, and this programme presents work by both men. Cheng’s 13 Tongues demonstrates beautifully the extraordinary, elemental quality of the Cloud Gate dancers, energy coursing through their butter-soft, titanium-strength bodies, limbs curling like tendrils of smoke.The piece is based on Cheng’s memories of his childhood neighbourhood, its chaotic street life and a local storyteller, Thirteen Tongues. It has the feeling of something both ancient and modern, the black-clad dancers singing folk songs before the appearance of a magical superhero in fluorescent frock. You can only conclude that Thirteen Tongues must have been a swirlingly meandering, tangential storyteller, as the hour-long piece flows and circles and takes random turns (a koi carp enigmatically appears) and never quite arrives.Lin’s Dust is a much more focused, literal performance. Inspired by its score, Shostakovich’s String Quartet No 8 in C minor, a piece written in war-ravaged Dresden, Lin looks in horror at victims of war and persecution, man’s inhumanity to man. Here are the exiles, the wretched, the powerless, faces smeared with dirt. They cower together, they beg and plead, they stumble and crawl along the ground.At one point the dancers kneel in a line and, one by one, they reach up and fall, their bodies fanning out like toppling dominoes. It’s the kind of formation you’d see slickly done in a musical, but here all we see are brief moments of hope immediately extinguished. Dust is a slow, pessimistic slide into the dark, yet Lin often lets the music speak loudest and, caught by a brightly dancing rhythm or unexpectedly sweet violin, it’s possible to find beauty amid the horror."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7150f799f7f3e453aa469db1dfc95f5efc67b5d5/352_692_4661_2798/master/4661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8ebe0080c74332cc51e9b7809458b70","title":"can i move my data to the eu before google shifts it to the us brexit","story":"Post-Brexit, Sean wants to keep his data protected by the EU’s GDPR rather than laxer US privacy lawsGiven Google’s recent announcement about moving UK users’ data to US jurisdiction, what’s the best way to migrate to EU-based services? Can you download+upload or crossload your Gmail to another service? And are we in for the same treatment by Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram et al? SeanLast week Google notified users that “because the UK is leaving the EU, we’ve updated our terms so that a United States-based company, Google LLC, is now your service provider instead of Google Ireland Limited. We’ve also changed our privacy policy to make Google LLC the data controller responsible for your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.”This makes sense. There is no reason why two countries that are not in the EU should store data in an EU country. It would be much better, of course, if Google stored UK data in the UK. However, now we are just one of dozens of small countries, it may be hard to justify the cost.Other online service providers may well make the same decision, after weighing the financial, commercial and legal costs of storing UK users’ data locally.At the moment, it should be a moot point. UK data is covered by the Data Protection Act 2018, which is the UK’s version of the EU’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). One problem is that the UK may lower its data protection and privacy standards to US levels, along with our food and other standards, as part of a US trade deal. Another problem is that even if we maintain EU-level regulations, there is no guarantee that the US will observe them. Given Trump’s actions since taking the US presidency, it is hard to imagine that the situation has improved since Edward Snowden shocked us with his revelations.It is hard to be sure where your data is stored because service providers can and do rent space in other people’s hyperscale data centres. However, as far as I know, only Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft have their own server farms in the UK. Google’s are in Dublin, Belgium, Denmark and Finland. Facebook’s are in Dublin and Denmark. Microsoft has a site in Dublin, of course, but it also has data centres in London, Durham and Cardiff.As traffic grows, the major online service providers keep opening new data centres to be closer to their customers. However, outside the US and the EU, coverage can be sparse. Google, for example, has only three data centres – in Chile, Singapore and Taiwan – for the whole southern hemisphere. It doesn’t have any in Africa, or in Brazil, China, India, Russia or Japan.Consumers who use Microsoft’s Outlook webmail do not have any control over where their data is stored. As a matter of principle, Microsoft stores it for best performance. Local storage is therefore the most likely option but that could depend on network speeds and whether there is enough local storage available.Again, it should be a moot point. Microsoft has been pushing for higher data protection standards in the US, and it responded to the GDPR by “levelling up”. That is to say, it applies GDPR standards for all users in all countries, even if the local regulations allow lower standards.If you are determined to switch away from Gmail, then Microsoft’s Outlook is an option. Both services offer 15GB of free storage and both will import your old emails, which makes for an easy transition. (Microsoft also offers an extra 5GB of storage in OneDrive, which Google doesn’t.) Both services let you reply from your “old” email address if necessary.However, getting everyone to use a new address takes time and I find Outlook’s infinite scrolling pages and broken searchmove routine a horrible experience in a browser. If you get a significant amount of email, I would only recommend it with a decent mail program such as Microsoft Outlook (the Office program), eM Client, Mailbird or whatever. Fortunately, the smartphone and Windows 10 apps, which provide a different view of your webmail, are fine.You could also consider GMX, the English-language version of the German email service, GMX.net (from Global Mail eXchange). It is a free service that can send encrypted emails and it includes three somewhat primitive office apps. GMX used to have a very limited amount of storage but now offers 65GB – space for “about half a million emails”, the company says. The idea is to use GMX’s Mail Collector to pick up mail from your other accounts and consolidate it in one place.It is a couple of decades since I last used GMX but it was very easy to open an account and it sent emails without any problems.I have mentioned some other alternatives – FastMail and ProtonMail – before. FastMail is a good, independent email service with 247 support at reasonable prices: $3 (£2.30) per month with 2GB of storage and $5 per month with 30GB. While the company is Australian, its servers are in Amsterdam and New York, so your data should be inside the EU. Fastmail encrypts the email on its servers and it supports YubiKey access for extra security.ProtonMail is an encrypted GDPR-compliant privacy-focused email service based in Switzerland, which has high data protection standards. Its free service only offers 0.5GB of storage, which isn’t viable for many users. Its Plus plan with 5GB of storage costs €5 (£4.18) per month or €48 per year.You cannot do anything about where Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram et al store your data. These are all proprietary services and they can do whatever they like. If you do not want them to store your data in the US, you will have to download whatever you need (if that’s possible) then delete your accounts.The same thing is true of most business services until they have grown big enough to start opening data centres overseas, such as Adobe.However, you do have a choice of online storage services or “cloud drives”, where the technologies are basically interchangeable. I covered some of these services in an earlier answer: Where’s the cheapest place to store 500GB of data online?If you fancy the Swiss option, pCloud will store 500GB of data for £47.88 per year or 2TB for £95.88 per year. It will also store 2TB for a lifetime for a one-off payment of £350. The assumption is that disk space will keep getting cheaper until the cost of storing 2TB is irrelevant.Have you got a question?

The main room is big enough to house major artists: all-standing crowds or fully seated ones, or a combination. Whoever is playing, expect the sound quality to be superb. Tokens are needed to purchase drinks, although the side-bar in the street around the corner is cash-friendly. There’s the AB Club upstairs, for smaller draws, and also the intimate AB Salon (above the side-bar) that regularly presents free electronic or experimental gigs. One week in October included AB shows by Australian psych-rockers King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard, German ambient keyboardist Nils Frahm, French-Colombian cumbia extremists Pixvae and Peruvian electronicists Dengue Dengue Dengue. Upcoming acts include Acid Arab, Moses Boyd, King Krule, and Kelis.• Boulevard Anspach 110, abconcerts.beBotanique is on the edge of a botanical garden and is out of the city centre, close to the northern train station. The venue is undergoing work but remains open, even incorporating artworks into the renovation. The main room is the 700-capacity Orangerie but the circular arrangement of the smaller Rotonde space is perfect for intimate gigs, such as Aldous Harding last May, with its mixture of standing and seats. Tokens are required at the bar, annoyingly vended by machines. There’s also a cafe bar that overlooks the gardens. Upcoming gigs include Wolves In The Throne Room, Waqwaq Kingdom, Jeffrey Lewis, Cocorosie, Plaid, and Joan As Policewoman. The venue’s annual festival, Le Nuits Botanique, is in May.• Rue Royale 236, botanique.beA rebranding of the Palais Des Beaux-Arts, Bozar opened in 1929 with the acoustically brilliant Henry Le Boeuf Hall at its core. Classical music is important here but this multi-stage complex also loves jazz, global and electronic music. Chicago techno legend Lil Louis played in 2018, so all seats were removed and a tarpaulin laid down so no mess would be made. Among Bozar’s regular weekenders are the Bruselas Flamenco Festival, Afropolitan, and a recent hosting of French electronica fest Nuits Sonores. There are usually several exhibitions running simultaneously in the vast gallery warren, with a Keith Haring retrospective on until 19 April 2020.• Rue Ravenstein 23, bozar.beFlagey looks like a huge art-deco ship and looms over a square, by the side of two small lakes, in the suburb of Ixelles, a short tram ride south of the centre. It’s a former radio studio (from the 1930s), with curvy wooden walls and fixtures, presenting mostly classical music in three different-capacity spaces. Flagey hosted the sold-out Brussels Jazz Festival during January and its Piano Days season dominated February. In the autumn, there were festivals revolving around Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and the 50th anniversary of the German ECM label.• Place Sainte-Croix, flagey.beOpen since 2006, Les Ateliers Claus is in a labyrinthine part of Saint-Gilles, one of the city’s most arty zones, and is a Brussels equivalent of Café Oto in London. The lineup is always erse and inspiring: a few months ago it hosted Japanese noise sculptor Keiji Haino and New York drummervibraphonist Ches Smith, stressing out the decibel meters to a packed crowd. It also promoted veteran prog rock band Magma in a larger venue, used when Claus proves too intimate. This joint has an inviting aura, with a bar beyond the stage that’s a good source of excitingly sour lambic beer. Coming soon: Thurston Moore, Terrie Ex, OOIOO and veteran US electronic composer Carl Stone.• Rue Crickx 15, lesateliersclausSince 2005, the global music promoter Muziekpublique has presented nearly all of its gigs at Théâtre Molière, a quaint old 1960s haunt in Matongé, the mostly Congolese quarter of Brussels. During Brussels Jazz Weekend it presented a night of African acts, topped by Super Rumba, a Zairean (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) soukous group who played in the theatre’s entrance bar. Muziekpubliqe has presented the likes of Baaba Maal, Martin Simpson and Totó La Momposina. In coming weeks, it has enticing players arriving from Ireland, Mali, France and Greece.• Square du Bastion 3, muziekpublique.beNot far from the church of Sainte-Catherine, the Roskam bar would be excellent even if merely pouring beer but every Sunday it hosts one of the best (and most adventurous) jazz sessions in Brussels. Admission is free, which leads to a ide between the concert conditions at the stage end of the room and the lively expression of the bar-end. Roskam seems to have a predilection for low-pitched instrument bandleaders, with Hélène Duret, Grégoire Tirtiaux and Thunderblender’s Sam Comerford making forceful impressions on bass clarinet, baritone and bass saxophones in recent months. These acts might not be well-known outside of Brussels but have the potential to make an impact beyond Belgium.• Rue de Flandre 9, cafe-roskam.beOnly a few steps from the Grand Place, this jazz club has the advantage of pulling in tourists as well as hepcats. It celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2020 and is modelled on the classic New York City club template – but with a relaxed Euro-cafe atmosphere. Food is available, and most of the seating is at tables, although hanging out on a barstool gives a prime view. There’s free admission for the weekly Tuesday jam session – which runs past midnight – and Wednesday’s Carte Blanche sets, which allow a different artist each month to present combinations of invited players. The weekend gigs are ticketed, and tend to sell out, featuring name artists or themed presentations. The emphasis is on mainline jazz but veers into funk, soul, African and Latin.• Rue des Pierres 5, themusicvillageWerkplaats Walter is a roost for the extremes of classical, electronic, jazz, rock and improvisation. It’s almost literally a roost, too, as the audience needs to climb an exterior iron stairway to the venue’s second floor, where they’ll be welcomed into the bar area. Walter vends its own beer, specially brewed for the venue in the village of Gijzegem. In the theatre, there are tiered ledges to the rear, and a large floor space, with a large sculptural mural along the right side, constructed by the Expanded Eye duo from Lisbon, utilising doors and window-frames discarded when the building was being renovated. The venue is in the Anderlecht suburb, and is the brainchild of drummer Teun Verbruggen. Coming up soon are the free jazz of Evan Parker and Slovenian pianist Kaja Draksler.• Rue Van Lint 43, werkplaatswalter.beAcross the side-street from AB’s bar entrance is Bonnefooi, which means “by chance”. A sign on the glass door reads “Can you stop making all that noise outside? People are trying to dance in here!” This is a joint that’s open for partying through the night and into the morning. Inside, the layout is simple: a long, narrow room, with a bar on the right, and a seated mezzanine looking onto the dance area. Free-entry gigs are frequent, ranging from the deep electronic pulsing of Demdike Stare and Paddy Steer to, for instance, an almost-acoustic midweek appearance by Moroccan gnaoua group Black Koyo.• Rue des Pierres 8, bonnefooi.beLooking for a holiday with a difference?

The mayor of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Tucker’s hometown, was running for governor, and the year before he had canvassed for Doug Jones, a Democrat running in a closely watched US Senate race.But Tucker wasn’t able to cast a ballot – state officials refused to even let him register. It wasn’t until weeks later that he learned why he had been deprived of the right to vote.He owed the state $4.The US is founded on the promise of democracy and fair representation, but it is also the country where minorities are frequently disenfranchised for political gain. Among the most vulnerable are millions of Americans, disproportionately African Americans, like Tucker, who have been entangled in America’s racially biased criminal justice system, and losing civil liberties like voting as a result.The barriers facing Americans like Tucker, advocates say, are modern adaptations of poll taxes and other devices which were designed to keep people from the voting booths during the Jim Crow era – when white politicians used the law to curb the civil rights of African Americans. Alabama is one of 30 states that requires people with felony convictions to pay back the financial obligations associated with their sentence before they can vote again.Tucker’s case is particularly glaring. He lives less than a hundred miles north-west of Selma, the birthplace of the voting rights movement in America. This week, civil rights leaders are commemorating the 55th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches led by Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights activists as they protested laws preventing African Americans from voting. Many were brutally beaten in Selma during the protests.The specific policy that had ensnared Tucker dates back to the turn of the 20th century when Alabama leaders, openly seeking to preserve white supremacy, stripped anyone convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude”, among other offenses, of the right to vote.“What is it that we want to do? Why it is within the limits imposed by the federal constitution, to establish white supremacy in this state,” John Knox, the chair of the convention, said at the time. “If we would have white supremacy, we must establish it by law – not by force or fraud,” he added.Tucker said the legacy of that discrimination affects the lives of people like him today.“I read about the challenges during the 60s, 50s, that black people had to overcome just to vote,” Tucker said. “It’s the same thing going on in 2020.”Tucker, who sometimes goes by Zo, speaks softly and deliberately. He has lived in Tuscaloosa his whole life, now in a modest house 10 minutes outside of downtown. He says he would have left the city where he grew up, but never had the money.Sitting in his living room, surrounded by pictures of family, Tucker said things are much different now for him than they were in the early 1990s, when he was much more “aggressive”. In the late 1980s, he got into a fight at a club with a University of Alabama football player and wound up being convicted of third-degree assault, a misdemeanor. A few years later, he fought with a police officer and was convicted of second-degree assault, a felony. He wound up going to prison for two years and serving several more on probation.After he got out of prison, Tucker rebuilt his life, working at steel factories and in maintenance, and chipping away at the approximately $1,600 that the court had ordered him to pay. He had two more children, which made him want to stay out of trouble. He joined the Nation of Islam.Before his conviction, Tucker had never voted. But in prison, Tucker had read about Medgar Evers, who fought for equal citizenship and was assassinated in Mississippi in 1963. When he got out, he started regularly voting in elections. He and his wife Narkita would bring his young children into the voting booth with them, wanting to teach them about the importance of a single vote, and the long struggle African Americans had faced to gain access to the ballot.But in 2013, Tucker got a letter from his state officials saying he could no longer vote.He was angry and upset, but didn’t act immediately – the letter didn’t tell him anything about how to get his voting rights back. Then came another letter, a few years later, this time addressed to his son, Alfonzo Tucker III, who had just turned 18, and claiming that he too was ineligible to vote. The younger Tucker, however, didn’t have a criminal record. It was a mistake, possibly because he shared his father’s name.Tucker got his son registered to vote, but the episode lit a fire in him. As the 2018 midterm elections approached, he went to an event where activists were helping people with felony convictions learn about their voting rights, and called up the Alabama board of pardons and paroles to talk about his case. Two weeks later, the board sent him a letter saying he still owed $135.10 in connection with his conviction.Tucker, who relies in part on disability income, borrowed money from his sister to pay off the debt. But just when he thought it was settled, a courthouse clerk told him he owed money for another decades-old criminal offense – an additional $5,535.47 which she said he had to pay back to gain back his vote.Faced with the staggering amount, Tucker contacted Blair Bowie, an attorney at Campaign Legal Center, a Washington DC voting rights group. It took Bowie 15 minutes to realize Alabama officials made a huge mistake.Under Alabama law, people with felonies only have to pay off the money originally assessed as part of their criminal conviction to regain their voting rights. By 2018, Tucker had paid back most of what he owed. But, unbeknown to him, the state had added an additional debt of $131.10, a fee that was irrelevant to whether he could vote because it was not part of his original conviction. And the $5,535.47 debt was from a misdemeanor offense, Bowie saw, which does not cause someone to lose their voting rights in Alabama.All that Tucker actually owed in order to vote was $4.“What is voter suppression if not officials wrongly telling you that you can’t vote?” Bowie said. “That’s been a classic way of disenfranchising people, particularly in Alabama.”After he paid the $135.10, Tucker drove two hours to Montgomery, the state capitol, with a friend to hand deliver the receipt to a staffer at the board of pardons and paroles.But weeks later he never heard anything back. The elections came and went, and Tucker couldn’t vote. The parole board declined to comment on Tucker’s case.Bowie eventually referred Tucker to John Paul Taylor, an organizer with the Southern Poverty Law Center, who followed up with the board and got Tucker registered to vote in 2019.Bowie and Taylor said Tucker shouldn’t have had to rely on experts to get his voting rights back.“Here’s a very clear example of a person who has jumped through every single hoop that you’ve given them and they’re still being denied because of something that they really don’t even know about,” Taylor said.Meanwhile, Tucker and Bill Foster, the friend he went to Montgomery with, helped start a group in Tuscaloosa to help assist people with felonies get their voting rights back. Tucker’s story helps people understand that they can in fact vote once they complete their sentence, said Larry Tucker, his cousin. And Alfonzo said he’s met other people who have wrongly been told they owe the state money.So far, Tucker estimates that they’ve been able to help about 10 people – people like Terrance Gray, 49, who learned he was eligible to vote last year. Gray believed he had been ineligible to vote since he was released from prison in 1996.“He told me that it will make a difference if more people go and vote,” Gray said of Tucker. “He’s always been on me about that.”Tucker plans to cast his first ballot since the ordeal this year (he says he likes Bernie Sanders). He thinks the state should give him back the extra $131.10 that he paid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a222b38392aaae27e77664b9ce8d8636d59b466/0_207_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47f6483c5a2778f297732807be3e14ad","title":"how have your travel plans been affected by the coronavirus","story":"We want to hear from those who have cancelled or rearranged travel plans due to the outbreakItaly and Iran have been forced to introduce travel restrictions due to major outbreaks in both countries.

In evidence to the court she urged ICJ judges to dismiss allegations of genocide and instead allow the country’s court martial system to deal with any human rights abuses. A final judgement is expected to take years.In a statement, Clooney, the human rights lawyer and barrister at Doughty Street Chambers in London, said: “Accountability for genocide in Myanmar is long overdue and I look forward to working on this important effort to seek judicial remedies for Rohingya survivors.”Clooney successfully represented former the Malian president Mohamed Nasheed and secured a UN decision that his 2015 jailing for 13 years was illegal.She also represented Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who spent more than 500 days in prison in Myanmar convicted of breaking the colonial-era Official Secrets Act. The journalists had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men in Rakhine state. They were freed in May 2019.The Gambia, a predominantly Muslim west African state, took the lead in the legal action when it submitted an application to the ICJ in 2019 alleging Myanmar breached the genocide convention, which was enacted after the Holocaust.Myanmar is accused over mass murder, rape and destruction of communities during an army crackdown in 2017. A UN fact-finding mission declared that the violence had “genocidal intent”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9aa43c97a1de9a14cda85cb7c25217ceddf9640/188_637_2628_1577/master/2628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b56c47acf9167e6e19c18b98358d3716","title":"coventry drivers could get 3000 transport vouchers for ditching cars","story":"Pilot project will offer people vouchers for public transport, taxis or car clubsDrivers in Coventry could be paid up to £3,000 a year in transport vouchers to ditch their cars under a UK-first scheme.The Transport for the West Midlands (TfWM) pilot project is designed to ease traffic congestion and improve air quality in the city.Those who scrap their cars will receive between £1,500 and £3,000 worth of mobility credits to spend using a smartphone app or Swift travel card, on public transport, taxis, bike shares or a car club.The offer is part of the West Midlands Combined Authority £1m scheme which will be trialled in Coventry next year, and could be rolled out across the region if successful.Andy Street, the West Midlands mayor, said: “Instead of asking people to trade in their old car for a new one, we are offering them credits to try something new – such as join a car-share scheme or take the bus or train.“Not only will people be saving money on the cost of running and maintaining their cars, but they will also help the region ease traffic congestion and improve air quality in the fight against climate change.”The trial has been funded by a £22m grant given to the region by the Department for Transport to develop and test new transport technology and schemes.Motorists who are willing to give up their cars will be able to apply for the trial scheme later in the year.Jim O’Boyle, Coventry city council’s cabinet member for jobs and regeneration, said: “This is a great idea which provides incentives to motorists. The key now is to work up the scheme in a way that benefits people who may be dependent on using a vehicle as part of their daily responsibilities. It’s about encouraging change without imposing it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f7f18b0bb03e88c684989b36d0cd6e5582e928e/0_33_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f23153b9685e114adaf5c86fbf5d1df1","title":"japanese woman tests positive for coronavirus for second time","story":"Tour guide from Osaka had been given all-clear in early February but then developed a sore throat and chest pains A woman working as a tour bus guide in Japan has tested positive for coronavirus for a second time, in what authorities say is the first such case.The woman, in her 40s and a resident of Osaka in western Japan, tested positive on Wednesday after developing a sore throat and chest pains, the prefectural government said. She first tested positive on 29 January and was discharged from the hospital after recovering on 1 February, before testing negative on 6 February.The health ministry confirmed the case was the first in Japan where a patient tested positive for coronavirus for a second time after being discharged from hospital, Japanese media said.Though a first in Japan, cases of second positive tests have been reported in China. The outbreak has spread rapidly and widely, infecting about 80,000 people globally and killing nearly 2,800, the vast majority in mainland China.“Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant and with minimal symptoms, and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs,” said Professor Philip Tierno at New York University’s school of medicine.He said much remained unknown about the virus: “I’m not certain that this is not bi-phasic, like anthrax,” he said, meaning the disease might appear to go away before recurring.The woman’s second positive test came as the number of confirmed cases in Japan rose by 16 to 186, in addition to the 704 diagnosed from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Tokyo has urged that big gatherings and sports events be scrapped or curtailed for two weeks to contain the virus, while pledging the 2020 Olympic Games will still go ahead.Japan has changed its strategy, seeking to slow its spread and minimise the number of deaths, including by closing schools in affected areas.Meanwhile a major Japanese bank reported an employee had tested positive for coronavirus. MUFG Bank, part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the country’s largest lender by assets, said a member of staff at a branch in central Aichi prefecture was confirmed to have the virus on Wednesday.A total of seven people have died in Japan from Covid-19 including four from the Diamond Princess."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/957c38b0b846e66415c44f181fc141f3db965fb9/473_972_2939_1763/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee9088822514178312c5042d00a44646","title":"what is coronavirus symptoms wuhan china pandemic spread covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread from person to person, and is the outbreak a pandemic?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 25 February, the outbreak has affected 80,000 people globally. In mainland China there have been 2,663 deaths among 77,658 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. More than 12,000 people affected in China have already recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries. The most badly affected include Japan, with 850 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and four deaths. Italy has recorded 229 cases and seven deaths, while South Korea has recorded 893 cases and eight deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran and the Philippines.There have been 15 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42f4ab77ac89f44c107f03f92ac5de9be4e9a6a1/0_122_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaf97bb01fd78d3c94c53d3c4ed5b47f","title":"coronavirus news live updates","story":"Follow latest updates as outbreak spreads and losses on stock market mountHello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus.Here’s a quick summary of the latest developments.

But the slow travel movement – a seismic shift in the mindset of once-frenetic holidaymakers – is one trend that seems set to stay. Casting aside the need for Instagram likes and bucket list ticks, slow travel shows there’s more to holidaying than whistle-stop city tours and frantic red-eye flights. Instead, we want to take our time over things: the slow swoosh of a sun-drenched French boat trip a peaceful cycle through the tulip fields of Holland a rocky amble around the Irish coast. Recently, the movement has been strengthened even further, as the Swedish concept of flygskam, or “flight shame” – which encourages people to boycott air travel in order to lower carbon emissions – takes hold. Now, how we travel is almost more important than where we travel, which makes getting about by ferry one of the wisest travel choices you can make. Here are a few more reasons to take to the seas.It allows you to connect with your passionsThe allure of travelling at your own pace is that you can explore a country under your own steam, be that on two feet or two wheels. If you’re an avid cyclist, taking the ferry means you can bring your beloved metal steed along with you to any destination at no extra cost (bike-friendly Holland should do the trick). And there’s no stingy baggage allowance or cramped overhead lockers to contend with, so you can bring all the energy bars and extra pairs of lycra you wish.Your holiday starts onboardRather than being confined to a few (small, uncomfortable) inches of a plane seat, there’s plenty to explore on the ferry. Kick back in the lounge with a newspaper, hot drink, comfortable seating and panoramic views of seabirds coasting over the ocean waves. Meanwhile, brasseries, food courts and bars offer more than enough options to settle grumbling bellies. You’ll find just as much freedom when you arrive at your destination, and as soon as your feet touch new soil you’ll be ready for your adventure, whether that’s exploring higgledy-piggledy French flea markets or cycling around Northern Ireland’s magnificent Causeway Coast – with no heinous jet lag.There’s no airport stressRare is the person who can pass through an airport unscathed by the stress of monstrous check-in queues, frustrating security processes and baggage handlers who treat moving suitcases like an Olympic discus event. Travelling by ferry offers a more laid-back approach, with streamlined boarding processes and no-fuss logistics. Best of all? There are no pesky “surprise” buses waiting to take you and a hundred other angry passengers to the correct terminal either.The fun’s in the journeyThink of slow travel as exploring the places “in between” A and B. By taking things slowly and savouring the journey, we become part of a place for a short time, rather than just lurching frantically through it. The deck of a ferry, the bunk of a cabin, or a window with expansive sea views becomes your new viewpoint, and you can immerse yourself in landscapes – from tiny islands to craggy coastlines – that you would never see from 35,000ft up, giving you a new appreciation of the part of the world that you’re travelling through.It broadens your horizonsPerhaps you’ve always stuck to the UK for your annual camping trip – liking the familiarity of that bluebell wood you know so well, or the campsite you love so much. Travelling by ferry allows you to push your boundaries a bit further and explore destinations you might never have previously considered. Why not swap the forests of England for the seaside campsites of Belgium? Or pay a visit to the historic battlefields of Ypres? Because really, exploring the unfamiliar is what adventure is all about.It’s ready-made mindfulnessNot all of us have time for meditation and paddleboard yoga, but there is something wonderfully calming about just slowing down. Getting anywhere by ship – where brains are lulled by the slow chug of the engine and frazzled nerves are calmed by the sound of the ocean – is about as close to mindfulness as you can get while not wearing a fluffy robe. And if a sand-splattered dog walk on a sprawling beach sounds like your kind of mindfulness, pets (including cats and ferrets) are welcome on board many P\u0026ampO Ferries routes too.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4185547.1582757282!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus what we know so far about how ireland is affected","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers wearing protective face masks arrive at the Hongqiao railway station in Shanghai. Photograph: Noel CelisAFP via Getty Images)Have there been any cases here so far?No. The Department of Health has said that 90 people have been tested for coronavirus in Ireland so far and all results have come back negative.That’s good, but what about Irish people abroad? Especially those who may be returning?Two Irish-German passengers who were on board the Princess Diamond cruise ship docked off Yokahama, Japan, tested positive for the coronavirus. They are not normally resident in Ireland are being treated in hospital in Japan.Elsewhere, a hotel on the island of Tenerife was placed under quarantine when an Italian doctor staying there tested positive for the coronavirus. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs is providing consular assistance to a number of Irish citizens in the area.Two other Irish citizens were quarantined in Liverpool in England after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship moored off Japan. Both subsequently left quarantine and reported they were healthy and safe.Great stuff. But does all this mean we should avoid overseas travel?The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised against all non-essential travel to China, and against all travel to the Chinese province of Hubei. It has also advised Irish citizens not to travel to areas of Italy affected by the outbreak. The travel advice applies to 10 specific towns where travel has been restricted, but not to the rest of the country.What if I’ve recently been to an affected area?Anyone who has been to an affected region (mainland China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Iran and four regions in northern Italy) in the last 14 days and is experiencing symptoms should self-isolate and call their GP.The same applies to anyone who has been in close contact with a confirmed case of the virus in the last 14 days and is experiencing symptoms. Anyone who has been to an affected region in the last 14 days, and are well, should visit hse.ie for advice.So is this going to mess a lot of people’s holiday plans up?A number of secondary schools across Ireland have decided to cancel school trips to Italy in light of the latest travel advice.Alexandra College in Dublin confirmed it had cancelled the school’s annual trip for transition year students to Italy after a teacher, who organised the trip and is from Italy, consulted with local Italian authorities.Irish holiday makers are also reportedly cancelling trips to Italy. In some cases, these included bookings for holidays that are not due to take place until the summer. Travel agents have also said that, for now, Irish people are stalling on making bookings.Is that affecting airlines? And what about other businesses, and our tourism industry?The airlines are feeling the pinch alright. Earlier this week, investors began ditching stocks that they believed were vulnerable to a European outbreak. One of the biggest was Ryanair, whose shares tumbled 13.4 per cent in Dublin.Ryanair says all its flights are operating as normal but added that it would follow any public health instructions that were issued. The same is true of Aer Lingus.Elsewhere, Junayeo Air confirmed last week that it had decided to postpone the scheduled launch of its proposed Dublin-Shanghai service on March 29th until further notice.It’s not just the airlines either. Many Irish companies have operations in affected regions or depend on them for supply lines, and they are also dealing with some of the fallout. For example, one of our biggest companies, Kerry Group, said sales in China are set to fall by about 30 per cent in the first quarter of the year.What are we going to do about citizens from affected regions coming here?The DAA, which operates Dublin Airport, has said it is currently “business as usual” at the airport with flights from affected regions landing as normal.The Government is doing what it can to limit mass influxes from affected regions. The surge in cases in Italy has forced the cancellation of Ulster’s Pro 14 rugby game against Benetton in Treviso due to take place on Saturday.Minister for Health Simon Harris has also called for the Ireland’s Six Nations rugby match against Italy on March 7th to be called off. Minister for Sport Shane Ross has said more sporting fixtures could be cancelled if necessary to prevent the spread.Could we not just screen people as they arrive in Ireland?No. Entry screening for Covid-19 “doesn’t work, wouldn’t work” and would be a “waste of resources”, the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said.Fair enough. Can expect other big events, like the St Patrick’s Day Festival, to follow suit then?The cancellation of mass gatherings, such as large conferences with a significant number of participants from a highly affected area, “may be justified in exceptional circumstances” according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Decisions to cancel however will be co-ordinated with organisers and public health authorities on a case-by-case basis. But it’s possible we will see more major events cancelled.What about schools?During a containment phase, school closures “are not justified”, the European Centre for Disease Control said.“There is also no data to support informed decisions on proactive school closures in terms of their anticipated effectiveness in mitigating the ... epidemic, due to the unknown level of transmission of this virus among children.”However, should transmission of the virus become widespread, school closures “may be necessary”, even though they probably would not reduce the impact of the epidemic. For now though, it seems unlikely.What are the chances of someone testing positive for the virus here and what happens then?Minister for Health Simon Harris has said the outbreak in Italy and in neighbouring countries means the chances of an Irish case in the coming days or weeks has increased significantly.He has designated the virus as a notifiable disease, which means doctors will be obliged to routinely notify the HSE when a case is diagnosed.The Department of Health is also understood to be looking at bringing the condition under legislation that would allow for a person with the virus to be detained and isolated."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4185565.1582725192!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what is coronavirus and what should i do if i have symptoms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCoronavirus: Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficultie.  Photograph:iStockWhat is Covid-19 - the illness that started in Wuhan?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?In Ireland, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should call the HSE to inform them. If you are well and have not been in contact with coronavirus, you will be told to watch out for symptoms over the next 14 days. You can continue with your daily life and go to work as usual.If you have had close contact with a person who has coronavirus, you will be monitored for 14 days. A doctor will phone you daily to make sure you remain well. You will be asked to stay separate from other people as much as you can for 14 days. This includes not going to work.If you’ve been to an affected area in the last 14 days and have a cough, fever (high temperature), feel short of breath or have difficulty breathing people are advised to phone their GP or emergency department, stay indoors, avoid contact with other people, follow this advice even if your symptoms are mildMore HSE advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here.Should I avoid overseas travel?The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised against all non-essential travel to China, and against all travel to the Chinese province of Hubei.\u0026nbspThe full travel advice to Irish nationals is availablehere.Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another?China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.How many people have been affected?As of February 25th , the outbreak has affected 80,000 people globally. In mainland China there have been 2,663 deaths among 77,658 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. More than 12,000 people affected in China have already recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries including Japan which also had hundreds of cases from a cruise ship, Italy, South Koream Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran, the UK and the Philippines.Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2 per cent in the epicentre of the outbreak, Hubei province, and less than that elsewhere.For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1 per cent and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10 per cent.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.Have there been other coronaviruses?Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35 per cent of about 2,500 people who have been infected.Is the outbreak a pandemic and should we panic?No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children. – News and Media"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4186605.1582813443!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus woman tests positive for a second time in japan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDisinfection professionals wearing protective gear prepare to disinfect against the coronavirus (COVID-19) on Thursday in Seoul, South Korea.

Earlier this week Iran’s deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi, tested positive for the virus. Before the announcment he had appeared sweating profusely during a news conference on the coronavirus.Two further patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of UK cases to 15, the Department of Health said on Thursday.The virus was passed on in Italy and Tenerife to these patients who have been transferred to specialists at the Royal Liverpool hospital and the Royal Free hospital, London.Though Ireland remains free of confirmed cases, widening concern over the threat posed by the virus has forced the cancellation of next month’s Ireland-Italy rugby games and may impact other mass gatherings, including the St Patrick’s Day festival.There was confusion too among schools with students returning in recent days from ski trips in areas of Italy affected by coronavirus clusters. Some schools sent pupils who had been in Italy home for several days as a precautionary measure, while in other schools, students, assuming they were well, were required to attend classes.PilgrimsThe decision by Saudi Arabia to suspend arrivals by foreigners for the Umrah pilgrimage and tourists from some two dozen countries where the coronavirus has spread comes ahead of the holy fasting of Ramadan, which begins in late April this year, when visits by Muslims to the kingdom accelerate.French president, Emmanuel Macron, warned on Tuesday an epidemic that is “on the way”. There are now 18 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France and two people have died.China’s health authority has reported another drop in the number of new infections, with 433 new confirmed cases and 29 deaths.The official death toll from covid-19 cases in Iran has increased to 22 people. Officials also said that 141 people have tested positive for the virus, but experts fear Iran is under reporting the true scale of the outbreak.Saudi Arabia has barred foreign visitors going on pilgrimage or Umrah in the country although the country has not reported any cases of the virus.As a result, Emirates airline says passengers from a number of countries - including China, Japan, Italy, Iran, India and Pakistan - won’t be allowed to fly with them to Saudi Arabia.The virus has infected about 80,000 people worldwide and killed more than 2,800, the majority in China where the outbreak began in late 2019.The number of new infections inside China was for the first time overtaken by new cases elsewhere on Wednesday, with Italy and Iran emerging as epicentres of the illness.Australia initiated emergency measures and Taiwan raised its epidemic response level to its highest, a day after US president Donald Trump put his vice president, Mike Pence, in charge of the US response to the looming global health crisis.Mr Trump has sought to play down the threat from coronavirus despite mounting concerns about unchecked worldwide contagion. In a press conference in Washington, the US president said the danger to Americans “remains very low” and predicted that the number of cases diagnosed in the country, currently on 15, could fall to zero in a “few days”.The United States and South Korea have also postponed joint military drills to limit the spread of the virus, which has emerged far beyond China, where it originated late last year, apparently in a market selling wildlife in the city of Wuhan.Stocks sunk deeper into the red, oil prices fell and US treasuries rallied into record territory as more signs of the global spread of the virus heightened fears of a pandemic.Global markets have dropped for six straight days, wiping out more than $3.6 trillion (€3.2tn) in value.The coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people and killed nearly 2,800, the majority in China. Much remains unknown about the virus but it is clear the ramifications of the world’s second-biggest economy in lockdown for a month or more are vast.The rapid spread of the virus in different places - notably Italy, Iran and South Korea - in recent days has met the definition for a pandemic, and raised alarm.There is no cure for the virus that can lead to pneumonia, and a vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop.First casesThere have been 3,246 cases outside China, including 51 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.A number of countries have reported their first cases in the past couple of days with the latest being Denmark, in a man who returned from a ski holiday in Italy, and Estonia, in a man returning from Iran, media reported.Brazil confirmed Latin America’s first infection on Wednesday.China reported 433 new cases on Thursday, against 406 a day earlier.South Korea reported another 334 cases, pushing its total to 1,595, the most in any country other than China.The US state department issued a new travel warning for South Korea after the US military reported on Wednesday its first case of the coronavirus, in a 23-year-old soldier based near the South Korean city of Daegu.The South Korean military has also reported a number of infections and confined most troops to base.A “command post training”, usually conducted by members of the two militaries’ combined forces command, will be postponed until further notice, the command said.The outbreak has played havoc with international aviation with airlines cancelling flights as countries ban visitors from hot spots and nervous passengers put off travel plans.News that a Korean Air flight attendant who worked on flights between Seoul and Los Angeles later tested positive, is likely to unnerve passengers further. – AgenciesStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Humanitarian catastrophe is playing out in face of attacks by Syrian and Russian forcesPresident Sisi leads procession, completing official rehabilitation of leader ousted in 2011Russian warplane-backed Syrian army fights Turkish troops close to M5 and Neirab villageFormer president (91) was jailed following 2011 popular uprising but freed in 2017Netanyahu threatens war despite impending election after two sides exchange fireEstimates suggest ruling reformists lose election following lowest turnout since 1979Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan says he will meet Putin, Merkel and Macron as Syrian government forces push to retake regionMany of senior conservatives are former supporters of Mahmoud AhmadinejadStuck between a closed border and Russian-backed forces, Syrians have nowhere to runPrime minister Netanyahu announces the settlement expansion 11 days before the Israeli electionBoth sides to sign agreement on February 29th if violent reduction period successfulErdogan\u0026rsquos policies have left Ankara isolated, with Moscow one of its most reliable partnersRussian warplanes strike rebel-held towns as Turkish military backs insurgent strikesErdogan, whose country has second-largest army in Nato, says \u0026lsquowe are making our final warnings\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoHistoric plan\u0026rsquo to extend high-speed train link to Western Wall criticised by archaeologistsRelief agencies overwhelmed by humanitarian crisis in northwest Syria, says UNUN says 875,000, mostly women and children, have fled heavy aerial bombing since December 1stUp to 1,400 captives to be traded in wake of fighter plane downing and village bombingHundreds of thousands of civilians in Idlib are scrambling to escape a widening offensive by Assad\u0026rsquos forcesBan on reformists and moderates suggests hardliners will win majority in assemblyStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4186679.1582800696!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk says it could abandon brexit trade talks in june","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson: The document rejects the EU’s call for an overarching agreement to cover trade, security, foreign policy and other issues. Photograph:  Daniel Leal-OlivasAFP via Getty ImagesBritain has published its blueprint for a future relationship with the European Union that envisages a bare-bones free trade agreement with no alignment of standards or regulations. It warns that if there is insufficient progress towards reaching agreement by the end of June, Britain could abandon talks in favour of preparing for trade with no deal from the end of the year.The 30-page negotiating mandate rejects the EU’s demand for a level playing field based on current shared rules on state aid, competition policy, taxation, employment and environmental rights.The document also rejects the EU’s call for an overarching agreement to cover trade, security, foreign policy and other issues. Instead, it proposes separate agreements, with the EU’s trade deal with Canada as the starting point for a future economic relationship.“It is a vision of a relationship based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals, with both parties respecting one another’s legal autonomy and right to manage their own resources as they see fit. Whatever happens, the government will not negotiate any arrangement in which the UK does not have control of its own laws and political life. That means that we will not agree to any obligation for our laws to be aligned with the EU’s or for the EU’s institutions, including the Court of Justice, to have any jurisdiction in the UK,” it says.The two sides have agreed to seek a deal by the end of this year and Britain has ruled out seeking an extension to the transition period that ends on December 31st. To secure such an extension, Britain would have to request it in advance of a planned high-level meeting with the EU in June.“The government would hope that by that point, the broad outline of an agreement would be clear and be capable of being rapidly finalised by September. If that does not seem to be the case at the June meeting, the government will need to decide whether the UK’s attention should move away from negotiations and focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion,” the negotiating mandate says.Although Britain rejects the EU’s call for binding level playing field commitments based on EU standards, the document calls for “reciprocal commitments” not to lower employment and environmental standards to encourage trade and investment. It also opens the door to reciprocal agreements on state aid and taxation.The negotiations begin in Brussels next week, with a second round planned for London in mid-March. The two sides are also expected to start separate talks next month on how to implement the Northern Ireland protocol.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  Jim WatsonAFP via Getty Images)American democracy plays out in the classical splendour of Washington and in domed statehouses from sea to rising sea. It also plays out in Las Vegas’s Bellagio Ballroom number six, between Frank Sinatra Drive and a chain diner with the unpromising name of Eggslut. There is no doubt as to the more impressive spectacle.Hotel housekeepers, still uniformed and name-tagged, are among the low-paid Nevadans who caucus for Bernie Sanders as the Democratic presidential nominee. In going to his side of the chandeliered room, they have somewhat bucked their formidable union. The invisibility of cleaners has become a cinematic trope (Roma, The Chambermaid) but these ones are momentarily of world import.That Sanders wants to improve their lot is not in question. Some leftists choose purism over half a loaf, but he tends to vote for what redistributive measures come before him in Congress. He would give Americans universal healthcare, statutory paid leave and other staples of the developed world. This has encouraged the notion that he – and his rival Elizabeth Warren – would Europeanise the US. The likeliest heir to these septuagenarians, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is another who looks admiringly across the ocean.So widespread is the idea of convergence with Europe, and so true in parts, it is also incumbent to state where it breaks down.What the US left appears to want is social democracy as understood by Robin Hood. It would tax astronomical wealth to fund popular programmes. It would not ask much more of the middle or even the upper middle classes. Warren’s signature tax spares all households with a net worth below $50 million. Sanders has more people in his crosshairs but still zeroes in on the very rich. With an election in the offing, this selective approach to revenue is hard to fault. There are lots of votes in a raid on Wall Street. There are fewer in a raid on the handsome suburbs around Tampa. Politicians have to be artists of the possible.Fabergé eggsThis does, however, put them at some odds with the social democrats of Europe, who tax more citizens more heavily. Denmark does not achieve fiscal receipts of 45 per cent of national output by going after a gilded sect of its population, languidly rolling Fabergé eggs to each other across marble floors. Nor does France (46 per cent) or Germany (38 per cent).The US tax take is just 24 per cent. The purring Train à Grand Vitesse, the social mobility that is more than theoretical – Democrats are right to want these things for their country. They just misunderstand the implications for tax policy. Or rather, they understand them all too well and choose to duck the resultant politics. Even the party’s most progressive field for a generation or two does not contemplate taxes that are European in breadth and depth.Pressed on this point, Democrats invoke the sage that was Willie Sutton. The criminal of yore targeted banks because, he said, with unanswerable logic, “That’s where the money is.” In a country with America’s titanic inequalities, the top 1 per cent is where the money is. It is the obvious percentile to press for revenue.Not all economists are certain these numbers work out. Doubts over costing have helped to all but kill Warren’s campaign. But even if the arithmetic is sound, there is the larger issue of principle. In targeting just the richest, Democrats rather imply that a welfare state is only worthwhile insofar as someone else pays for it. It is not an inherent good. It is not a nation’s binding agent. Republican worldviewIn this sense, the Sanders and especially the Warren platform is a tacit concession to the Republican view of the world, with tax as a burden, not what the jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes defined as “what we pay for civilised society”. The Democratic appeal is less to Nordic universalism and solidarity than to the noblesse oblige of a remote overclass who will not miss the money.You can sense that Sanders burns to make the higher case: that patriotism entails a material commitment to one’s fellow citizens, not just flag-waving and anthem-warbling, those tellingly inexpensive pursuits. But then President Donald Trump wants him to make it too. The implied taxes would have middle-class voters, including those who abhor him, wondering at the cost of a presidential change in November. The Democrats understand this no less well. And so even the most left-wing bunch in decades proposes a social democracy that is not very social, nor all that democratic, and as European as the Eiffel Tower that disfigures the Vegas Strip. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: Government defeated in plans for Heathrow expansionCoronavirus latest news: Two new confirmed cases in England, bringing UK total to 15Comment: A post-Brexit deal may come late and be less than perfect, but it can be doneGreta Thunberg visit: Police warn of \u0026#39crushing\u0026#39 risk to children at Bristol protestChinese 100,000-strong \u0026#39duck army\u0026#39 bound for Pakistan to fight locust plagueDavid Beckham\u0026#39s romantic trinket from first meeting with VictoriaUK weather: Storm Jorge to hit UK on FridayComment: Coronavirus raises serious questions about the future of big-state control in the WestHow coronavirus is impacting the global luxury marketComment: Boris Johnson won\u0026#39t let Michel Barnier cherry-pick his preferred post-Brexit dealComment: The NHS is woefully ill-equipped for coronavirus - but there is hopeUK tells EU: Agree trade deal by June or no deal is back on table Hammer-weilding trans woman  escapes prison after judge hears there was no way to confirm her genderIllegal drug use costs society £19 billion a year through violence, crime and ill-health, finds reviewSt David\u0026#39s Day 2020: Welsh traditions, medieval miracles and how leeks became an iconic symbolWhat is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?Revealed: UK\u0026#39s red lines for Brexit trade dealHeathrow airport: Third runway plans blocked by Court of AppealNorth Korea imposes draconian measures to keep coronavirus at bayWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"knew close river never did expect like","story":"In the rush to prepare for the birth of her second son, Jenny Mason-Gunning did not factor in the possibility of her printing business being several feet under water.

I\u0027m just trying to stay calm, she says.They are among dozens of residents and businesses in the Ironbridge Gorge to have been evacuated in recent days as the swollen river rose to near-record levels.On Wednesday morning, homes in the Wharfeage area of Ironbridge – a world heritage site containing the first ever iron bridge – were evacuated as temporary flood barriers, which had held during the past week of downpours, were finally overwhelmed. At its peak, the river reached 6.8 metres at Ironbridge, just shy of the 7.04-metre record set in 2000. Even with levels slowly coming down, Environment Agency pumps worked into the evening amid fears that water would engulf parts of the historic town if they stopped.David Nolan, 63, was among those evacuated when police officers urged him and his wife to leave their three-storey Georgian home. Until now the barriers have done their job pretty well, but the sheer force of the water is what has been so destructive, he says.The Tontine Hotel, a local pub that overlooks the bridge, has taken in some of the evacuees. By the afternoon, it had temporarily run out of real ale because delivery trucks could not get past the emergency crews.Other evacuees were taken to the Valley Hotel on the other side of Ironbridge, among them Ian Donnelly, a 45-year-old retired Royal Artillery warrant officer who now works in the NHS and has been staying here since Monday. We were allowed to collect a few things and then had to decide what to sacrifice, he says. He and his partner still have no idea of the damage that has been done to their home by the floods. The last thing we want to do is put somebody at risk trying to get back inside the property, he explains.Some Ironbridge residents described seeing fish swimming in their front gardens, while others spoke of ducks cruising past their front doors.In the nearby village of Dale End, Brooke Evans, 26, who only opened her hair salon in December, has been flooded three times in a week and had to don waders to even access the business.Her cellar has flooded and, like many businesses and homeowners in the area, she can\u0027t get insurance to pay for the damage and loss of earnings. We knew it was close to a river – but never in a million years did I expect it to be like this, she says.Communities downstream of Ironbridge remain braced for yet more flooding. The village of Bewdley, 20 miles or so away, flooded on Tuesday evening when water spilled over the top of temporary defences. It has been warned to prepare for another deluge. The Environment Agency says the flooding along the Severn, England\u0027s longest river, will persist until Sunday at the earliest, with more rainfall forecast for the coming days.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 27th february 2020","story":"Harry Styles performs onstage during the Citi Concert Series on TODAY Presents Harry Styles at Rockefeller Plaza, New York CityKevin MazurGetty Images for CitiPolitics latest news: Government defeated in plans for Heathrow expansionCoronavirus latest news: Two new confirmed cases in England, bringing UK total to 15Comment: A post-Brexit deal may come late and be less than perfect, but it can be doneGreta Thunberg visit: Police warn of \u0026#39crushing\u0026#39 risk to children at Bristol protestChinese 100,000-strong \u0026#39duck army\u0026#39 bound for Pakistan to fight locust plagueDavid Beckham\u0026#39s romantic trinket from first meeting with VictoriaUK weather: Storm Jorge to hit UK on FridayComment: Coronavirus raises serious questions about the future of big-state control in the WestHow coronavirus is impacting the global luxury marketComment: Boris Johnson won\u0026#39t let Michel Barnier cherry-pick his preferred post-Brexit dealComment: The NHS is woefully ill-equipped for coronavirus - but there is hopeUK tells EU: Agree trade deal by June or no deal is back on table Hammer-weilding trans woman  escapes prison after judge hears there was no way to confirm her genderIllegal drug use costs society £19 billion a year through violence, crime and ill-health, finds reviewSt David\u0026#39s Day 2020: Welsh traditions, medieval miracles and how leeks became an iconic symbolWhat is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?Revealed: UK\u0026#39s red lines for Brexit trade dealHeathrow airport: Third runway plans blocked by Court of AppealNorth Korea imposes draconian measures to keep coronavirus at bayWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/16/13/gettyimages-103570612.jpg","title":"drax coal power station stops biomass climate change","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Drax power station to convert generators to biomass, but the technology\u0027s environmental impact is debatedThe owner of one of Europe\u0027s biggest polluting coal-fired plants has said it will phase out the dirty fuel from its Yorkshire power station in March next year, a major step in Britain\u0027s efforts to quit coal.Drax said that it had reviewed its operations and held discussions with the grid, the regulator and the Government, before deciding to end commercial coal generation at the Selby site.“Ending the use of coal at Drax is a landmark in our continued efforts to transform the business and become a world-leading carbon negative company by 2030,” said chief executive Will Gardiner.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt is the latest in a line of coal plants that are being closed, leaving just a handful.

Last year the country went for more than a fortnight without burning a single lump of the black stuff, thought to be the first time since the 1880s.At around 8am on Thursday, coal was supplying only 1.9 per cent of the country\u0027s energy needs. It has largely been replaced by gas, which provided 50 per cent\u0026nbspon Thursday morning, and wind, 17 per cent.However, coal is still being used for industrial purposes, such as steelmaking.Drax already burns biomass at the site, a renewable fuel which consists of plant material and animal waste. However its critics say that it causes deforestation, and encourages farmers to grow monocrops just to be burned.Mr Gardiner said: “By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK\u0027s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.”He added that the business is still “fully committed” to the regions its operates in “and with the right regulatory and investment framework is well positioned to deliver its plans for Yorkshire and the Humber”.It came as the company said adjusted profit before tax hit £142 million in 2019, up from £37 million the year before, on revenues of £4.7 billion, up around 11 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year the country went for more than a fortnight without burning a single lump of the black stuff, thought to be the first time since the 1880s.At around 8am on Thursday, coal was supplying only 1.9 per cent of the country\u0027s energy needs. It has largely been replaced by gas, which provided 50 per cent\u0026nbspon Thursday morning, and wind, 17 per cent.However, coal is still being used for industrial purposes, such as steelmaking.Drax already burns biomass at the site, a renewable fuel which consists of plant material and animal waste. However its critics say that it causes deforestation, and encourages farmers to grow monocrops just to be burned.Mr Gardiner said: “By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK\u0027s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.”He added that the business is still “fully committed” to the regions its operates in “and with the right regulatory and investment framework is well positioned to deliver its plans for Yorkshire and the Humber”.It came as the company said adjusted profit before tax hit £142 million in 2019, up from £37 million the year before, on revenues of £4.7 billion, up around 11 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Allowing students to apply after they receive their results would bring us into line with the rest of the world and eliminate the use of controversial unconditional offers.“This review is the opportunity for us to finally move to a system where university offers are based on actual achievement rather than unreliable estimates of potential.”Claire Sosienski Smith, vice president of higher education at the National Union of Students (NUS), said: “It has been clear that for some time the admissions system has not been working in the interest of students, so it is good to see that the OfS is taking action.”Any changes to the admissions system will require the agreement of policymakers, universities and colleges, exam boards and schools, the OfS has said.\u0026nbspGovernment could scrap university offers based on A-level predictionsLabour will scrap university offers based on predicted A-level gradesConcerns over \u0027irresponsible\u0027 rise in unconditional university offersUniversities minister Michelle Donelan said the regulator’s review would be “instrumental” in helping to assess how the system can be improved.\u0026nbspShe said: “Our world-leading universities should be open to everyone with the potential. It is therefore vital that their admissions processes are transparent and work in students\u0027 best interests.“It is clear some practices, such as conditional unconditional offers, can limit the opportunities and outcomes for some students and changes are needed.”Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of UUK, said the organisation is continuing its work through the review to look at which admissions practices are “fair, transparent and operating in the best interests of students”.He said: “The UK-wide review will make recommendations informed by what applicants, schools and universities think works well and where the main challenges lie in achieving greater fairness, transparency and aspiration-raising.”Office for Students\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is also relatively similar to Earth: with a radius 2.6 times as big as our planet\u0027s and a mass 8.6 times Earth\u0027s.The world known as\u0026nbspK2-18b is also already somewhat famous. It was discovered in 2017, prompting frenzied speculation about what conditions might be like there, and was the subject of even more excitement towards the end of last year, when it was the first ever potentially habitable planet found to have water vapour in its atmosphere.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

And it suggests that they could be habitable in just the way scientists had hoped.Nasa loses contact with satellite monitoring mysterious exoplanetsDr Nikku Madhusudhan from Cambridge\u0027s Institute of Astronomy, who led the study, said: Water vapour has been detected in the atmospheres of a number of exoplanets but, even if the planet is in the habitable zone, that doesn\u0027t necessarily mean there are habitable conditions on the surface.To establish the prospects for habitability, it is important to obtain a unified understanding of the interior and atmospheric conditions on the planet - in particular, whether liquid water can exist beneath the atmosphere.Because of the size of K2-18b, some suggest it would be more like a smaller version of Neptune than a larger version of Earth.It is thought a mini-Neptune would have a significant hydrogen envelope surrounding a layer of high-pressure water, with an inner core of rock and iron.If this envelope is too thick, it would be too hot, and pressure at the surface of the water layer beneath would be far too great to support life.According to the new study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, despite the size of K2-18b, its hydrogen envelope is not necessarily too thick and the water layer could support life.Astronomers used the existing observations of the atmosphere, to confirm the atmosphere is hydrogen-rich with a significant amount of water vapour.They also found that levels of other chemicals such as methane and ammonia were lower than expected.But whether these levels can be attributed to biological processes remains to be seen.The minimum amount of hydrogen is about one-millionth by mass, similar to the mass fraction of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Women are really motivated when they freeze eggs.“They think long and hard about this medical choice. It is costly. You do not do it lightly. It is not appropriate for women to be thwarted because the current legislation is not appropriate. Current laws are out of date with modern medical practice.”The current process means if a woman freezes her eggs in her early twenties – the time at which she is most fertile – she must utilise the eggs by the time she is in her early thirties.Researchers argue the 10-year cut off point could deter women from freezing their eggs in their twenties and lead to them doing so in their thirties despite their chances of successfully getting pregnant being lower.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Family planning is changing and many people choose to have children later in life. We wish to ensure that those who want to have a baby have the best possible chance of success.”Only eggs that are stored for medical reasons can be preserved for longer – up to 55 years in total.Adam Balen, spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “Currently, the 10-year limit is too restrictive and not fit for purpose.“It seems likely that the future will see increasing numbers of women storing eggs, mostly because they are not in a relationship, but there remains a need for societal changes that support women in the workplace to have their family at a biologically optimal age if they so choose without compromising their career prospects.“There remains an increasing recognition of the need to improve public education about age-related changes in female fertility that should highlight the importance of men’s knowledge as well as women.”Researchers called for women who choose to freeze their eggs to be “fully informed” of the likelihood of success, costs and risks – drawing attention to the fact that the latest data shows only 18 per cent of IVF treatments that utilised a woman’s own frozen eggs resulting in success.Egg freezing for non-medical reasons can only be accessed through the private health sector and is costly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Over 199 episodes, the series followed Ironside and his team in his role as consultant to the Police Department as they sorted out the bad guys of the City by the Bay.    Ian Rankin says he has never watched any of the television adaptions of his famously brooding, heavy drinking, loner detective because he didn’t want the actors’ faces replacing how he envisaged Rebus in his head. Two actors have played Rebus on screen, John Hannah and Ken Stott. Hannah gives the role his best but was probably too young and lacked the cynical gravitas that Stott gave to Rebus. With similar roles in The Vice and Messiah giving Stott an identifiable acting persona, he perhaps has the same problem as Humphrey Bogart being too much like Bogart to play the definitive Philip Marlowe, but in the absence of any other candidates, Stott is just fine. Rankin’s central theme of the Jekyll and Hyde dichotomy of Scotland’s capital city remains intact, and as in the novels, the real star of the show is of course, Edinburgh itself in all its historic beauty, showing the dark underbelly of the city behind the chintz curtains. 320 18. Life on Mars (2006-07)Nostalgia might not be what it used to be, but the biggest mystery with Life on Mars is why it took someone so long to come up with this inspired paean to the pop culture and TV cop shows of the 1970s. Throw in the fish-out-of-water time travel motif and the tongue in cheek non-PC scripts and characters, and its not hard to see why the series struck a chord with audiences.    Like many of his ilk, dedicated near-genius DCI John Luther (a brilliant Idris Elba) is a tormented soul, struggling with his own inner demons, hugely affected by the stomach churning crimes he investigates. Luther is so obsessive that he will do anything to get his man (or woman, in the case of his nemesis, the psychopathic scientist Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson) Both cerebral and heart pumping, Luther was created by Neil Cross and has spawned American and Russian versions.Gillian Anderson is the deliberate, dedicated senior detective on the trail of an equally meticulous serial killer in this controversial drama filmed and set in Northern Ireland. The Fall survived accusations of misogyny and voyeurism to lift a Bafta for best television drama and keep viewers hooked for three series, but remains a troubling, unsettling experience for many.620 15. Cagney and Lacey (1981-88)The cop show that more than any other blew the stereotypical image of female police officers out of the water, and challenged the sexist attitudes of many executives in the television industry. Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless won the hearts of millions of viewers, and six Emmys between them, as two dedicated New York police officers who happened to be women with normal lives and challenges like everyone else. The bond between the two characters was unbreakable despite leading entirely different lives (Lacey was married with a family and supportive husband, Cagney drifted from relationship to relationship). A game changer in many ways, Cagney and Lacey explored issues such as rape, abortion and Cagney’s alcoholism head on.720 14. Between the Lines (1992-94)Set in the politan Police Complaints Investigation Bureau, the Bafta winning Between the Lines follows ambitious Chief Superintendent Tony Clarke and his team as they investigate corruption within the police force. Between the Lines drew praise for the way it tackled topical issues of the day as it attempted to address the age old moral dilemma, quis custodiet ipsos custodes – who will guard the guards themselves?The cop show that more than any other blurred the lines between the good guys and the bad guys. Rogue cop Vic Mackey leads the elite “strike force” of LA detectives who routinely break the law to keep the streets safe, but also to feather their own nest. There are subplots aplenty, and Mackey’s downfall plays out almost like a Shakespearean tragedy.Set in the fictional northern town of Newtown, Z Cars broke new ground in police drama shows, challenging the homely predictability of the likes of Dixon of Dock Green. Devised by Allan Prior and Troy Kennedy Martin, the series centred on not just one central protagonist, but rather several police officers both uniformed and plain clothed. Z Cars brought some iconic characters into the nation’s living rooms such as detective Charlie Barlow, PC “Fancy” Smith and desk sergeant Bert Lynch. The police officers themselves were portrayed warts and all, with gritty subject matter, including domestic abuse at the hands of a police officer, at the heart of the storylines. The actors became household names with the iconic theme tune whistled on everyone’s lips, and of course there were the “Z” cars themselves, the American-style Ford Zephyr and Zodiac patrol cars.   If Cagney and Lacey blazed the trail for female cops, then the first series of Prime Suspect in particular indicated a seismic shift in the perception of, and the attitudes towards, the female police officer. Helen Mirren is outstanding as DCI Jane Tennison who heads a murder squad hunting a sadistic serial killer, but has to overcome opposition and resentment from her team as well as the institutionalised sexism of the police department itself. Subsequent series concentrated more on Tennison’s inner demons as she began to rely on alcohol to help her cope with the pressures of the job.  This Danish police procedural and prime example of Scandinavian noir attracted criticism for its violence against women. It did, however, become an international success particularly in the UK. Viewers were gripped by the formula that of each episode reflecting 24 hours in the same murder case, and by the cold-fish female detective protagonist Sarah Lund, while developing an almost fetishist fascination with her knitwear. The Killing paved the way for other subtitled European crime dramas and equally popular and acclaimed entries such as The Bridge and Borgen quickly followed.     1220 9. Law and Order (1990-2010)Filmed in New City with a two-pronged approach of the investigation of a crime and arrest of a suspect, followed by the suspect’s trial, Law and Order introduced one of the great small-screen detectives, recovering alcoholic Lennie Briscoe. (Jerry Orbach). The show’s boast was that many of its subject matters were “ripped from the headlines” and it was this approach that gave it a compelling topical feel and made it the longest-running American crime series and the benchmark for police procedurals.1320 8. Line of Duty (2012- )An outstanding ratings success for BBC2, Jed Mercurio’s masterful police corruption thriller gripped viewers from the very beginning and kept them guessing until the explosive climax to the third series. The bold, serpentine and gripping storylines provided the exemplary cast with parts of a lifetime, with the most outstanding feature of Line of Duty undoubtedly the lengthy interrogation scenes as the tension was racked up notch by notch. After Bing Crosby turned the role down, Peter Falk became synonymous with the cigar smoking, dishevelled police lieutenant in a shabby raincoat, winning four Emmys and a Golden Globe. Referred to as a “howcatchem” by its’ creators, Columbo deviated from the traditional whodunit in that the audience and, it seemed, Columbo himself, knew the identity of the murderer from the start. Half the fun of the show was watching the murderer (frequently an A- or B-list guest star) underestimate the seemingly bumbling, absent-minded detective while he baited the trap to snare them. Oh, and just one more thing, as Columbo himself might say: although Columbo routinely spoke of his wife, she was never seen in any episode, but the character was later given her own, short-lived, spin-off show, Mrs Columbo. It has been compared to the works of Dickens and Dostoevsky and lauded as the greatest television programme ever. But the triumph of The Wire is how it tells the story of the decaying city of Baltimore through the lives of the police, drug dealers, politicians, children and the dispossessed, making no moral judgements between good and bad in a predominately grey world. The Wire may not be the greatest television programme ever, but its realism and authenticity can never be in doubt. In 2005, members of a drugs gang claimed they had studied The Wire in order to learn about the latest police surveillance techniques, surely the ultimate example of life imitating art. Aping its antecedent Hill Street Blues’ cinema verite style, multi award winning NYPD Blue was a natural progression for co-creator Steven Bochno, who along with David Milsch came up with even grittier storylines, atmospheric New York locations and warts ’n all characters to create a hugely compelling and influential cop show. But let’s be honest, despite a terrific ensemble cast, Dennis Franz as scenery-chewing recovering alcoholic detective Andy Sipowicz, was virtually the whole show, appearing in all 261 episodes and in the process searing his psyche in viewers’ minds.1720 4. Homicide: Life on the Street (1993-98)Baltimore native Barry Levinson was a natural fit as executive producer of this ultra-realistic police procedural, based on The Wire creator David Simon’s book chronicling his experiences following homicide detectives at work in the so-called “City of Firsts”. From the very first episode Life on the Street succeeded in dispelling the myths and stereotypes about the television cop, showing that murder and violence were just a routine parts of the job. Indeed the murder of a schoolgirl in that first episode was never solved. Aficionados rate this show even better than The Wire. Some have called Homicide: Life on the Street the missing link between Hill Street Blues and The Wire. Beg, borrow or steal the box set and find out why.   Such is the renown of the celebrated television adaptation of Colin Dexter’s novels featuring the enigmatic real-ale swilling, arts loving, crossword buff detective, that there’s very little left to say apart from it’s basically a brilliant variation on the classic English whodunit, Kevin Whately’s Lewis is to John Thaw’s Morse as Dr Watson was to Sherlock Holmes, and Thaw is simply wonderful.It has become so caricatured and parodied in recent years that it’s easy to overlook the fact that The Sweeney made Z Cars look as antiquated as the former did Dixon of Dock Green a decade earlier. Created by Ian Kennedy Martin, brother of Z Cars co-creator Troy, The Sweeney was shot in 16mm film and that, along with extensive location shooting, gave it a more cinematic look than other studio-bound rivals. Created by Steven Bochco and Michael Kozoll and still celebrated, still hugely influential, and still the cop show to which almost everything that has come since owes a huge debt. From Mike Post’s iconic theme and the innovative cinema vèritè-evoking handheld camera, to the brilliant ensemble cast creating beloved characters and dramatic storylines in the urban sprawl of an unnamed US city, Hill Street Blues pioneered a new wave of cop shows. Ironically, it never gained huge audience ratings, but garnered a grand total of 98 Emmy nominations. Groundbreaking, thought provoking, emotional and funny, Hill Street Blues stands tall in the canon of truly great television.Launched to much fanfare as a television movie and boasting a killer theme tune from Quincy Jones, Ironside starred Raymond Burr, who was still hot after his stint as television’s Perry Mason, as San Francisco Chief of Police Robert T Ironside, who is confined to a wheelchair after an attempted assassination.

I don’t know why I did that but it was definitely unnecessary for sure.”She also spoke about her regrets over her own drinking on the series. “I think there’s a reason that there’s sometimes alcohol around during these reality shows,” she said. “Sometimes you loosen up and these moments can kind of come out. I really wish that I would have been better about the drinking for me.

I landed and got some really negative comments on Instagram and it was just a shock.“It was the first time I had really ever experienced anything like that. Initially, I had a lot of negativity and hatred. But honestly it’s gotten a bit better as of late… I can separate it a little bit. It’s okay. I totally understand why there are some of those comments out there.”Love is Blind is a hybrid of a dating show and a scientific experiment, in which contestants are placed in “pods” and required to make conversation with potential life partners they cannot see.

It follows a hypnotist\u0026nbsp(Wener Krauss) who uses a sleepwalker (Conrad Viedt) to commit murders.Since its release in 1920, the film has been considered a defining film of the German Expressionist cinema movement, alongside others\u0026nbspdirected by\u0026nbspFW Murnau\u0026nbsp(Nosferatu, 1922) and\u0026nbspFritz Lang (polis, 1927).Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThese films typically feature protagonists amid nightmarish landscapes, which were stylised in ways that went on to inspire everything from the music of David Bowie to\u0026nbspthe films of Tim Burton.The Cabinet of Dr Caligari was written by Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz\u0026nbspin the aftermath of the First World War, with its influences laid bare in the film’s characters: Caligari is a symbol of the German war government, while the somnambulist is a representation of everyday people who were conditioned to kill as soldiers.New horror film branded ‘scariest in years’ after Sundance premiereUnearthed article recounts the chaos and panic caused by The Exorcist 37 horror films that will actually scare youBoth Mayer and Janowitz were pacifists.Intriguingly, the film\u0027s twist ending is claimed to have been forced into the plot against the writers\u0027 will. Not that its addition muddied the film’s success – critic Roger Ebert famously called it “the first true horror film” and its ensuing success\u0026nbsphelped enhance the artistic merit of German cinema.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The most shocking film twists of all time Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t.

The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her.

A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress.

The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash.

After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it.

Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight.

The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years.

The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand.

The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker.

It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house.

When it\u0027s a furry, charismatic animal, it makes it different.”In the past, monkeys in the area have been trapped and sold for biomedical research over concerns about them plundering birds’ nest and potentially passing herpes on to humans.But that solution also received backlash from animal rights groups concerned about the monkeys’ welfare.“It is a tragedy that wild monkeys are torn from their families and forest homes and sold to research and testing laboratories,” one group said in 2013, as reported by the local Ocala Star-Banner newspaper.Although the chances of humans being infected by the monkeys are slim, a study published in a journal of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has described herpes B as a “public health concern” and concluded up to 30 per cent of the park’s macaques shed the virus in their saliva, urine and faeces.“Hundreds of bites and scratches occur every year in monkey facilities in the United States, but people rarely get infected with B virus,” the CDC said on its website.Park officials have resorted to warning tourists to keep their distance from the monkeys, instead of actively controlling the population, amid concerns about aggression from the animals towards visitors.“We tell people not to approach them, not to feed them, because we want people to stay safe,” Craig Littauer, a park services specialist, told The Post.Trump to be protected by monkey police on India visit‘New species of monkey’ discovered in Amazon rainforestThree dolphins found shot and killed off Florida coastFlorida could use drones to fight pythons Frozen iguanas to fall from trees in Florida, forecasters warnHowever, despite concerns\u0026nbspabout the population growth, the monkeys remain a popular tourist attraction.“First thing everyone asks about is the monkeys,” Nick Bozman, who runs tours transporting visitors along the park’s Silver River, told the Ocala Star-Banner.Nevertheless, he admitted\u0026nbspthe animals were “not supposed to be here”.“It\u0027s a double-edged sword,” he told the newspaper.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 February“I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing,” Mr Sanders later told CNN. “That is a fact. End of discussion.”Supporters of the Vermont senator, a self-described democratic socialist for more than 40 years, point to polls putting him ahead in next Tuesday’s Texas primary, one of more than a dozen states that will be voting on what has come to be known as Super Tuesday. An average of polls collated by RealClearPolitics puts him on 22 points, ahead of Joe Biden, 20, and Elizabeth Warren on 15 points.Meanwhile, another poll, conducted for the Texas Lyceum, a non-profit group, suggested Mr Sanders was the strongest Democrat\u0026nbspin hypothetical match-ups with Mr Trump, falling just three points short of him on 50-47. This compared to 51-46 for Mr Biden, 52-44 for Ms Warren and 51-43 for Pete Buttigieg.A victory in Texas next Tuesday would mark a major milestone and potential tipping point for the Sanders’ campaign, as it seeks to collect delegates and tie up the nomination ahead of the party’s summer convention.Yet a win in November would be little short of staggering. Texas is a major prize, with the highest number of electoral college votes, 38, other than California, where Mr Sanders also looks strong.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The last Democrat to hold a statewide office was in the 1990s, and the party’s last presidential candidate to win here was Jimmy Carter in 1976.Meet the Democratic women looking to turn Texas blue in 2020Demographic changes in places such as Houston have given Democrats cause to hope. The 2018 midterms saw the party pick up a handful of seats in the House of Representatives, and Beto O’Rourke’s long-shot challenge to Ted Cruz in the Senate race shocked both parties, even though Mr Cruz held on 51-48.Last year saw at least six Republicans from the House announce they were standing down, amid a so-called “Texodus”. Among them was Will Hurd, the only African American Republican congressman.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsppreviously reported on efforts to turn red Texas blue, driven in large part by large numbers of women candidates challenging for House seats, Senate races, and control of the state assembly, something considered a priority.Yet longtime Texan political strategists from both parties believe while Mr Sanders could win the primary, it would very difficult to beat Mr Trump there.Matt Mackowiak, president of the Potomac Strategy Group, told The Independent: “I think Bernie could win the primary. But if he’s the candidate in November, I think Trump will increase the nine point advantage he had in 2016.”He added: “I think Bernie Sanders will be radioactive in the suburbs, and that he will also impact down ticket races.”Matt Angle, a Democratic strategist and founder of the Lone Star Project, a political action committee that funds Texas candidates, said last year that\u0026nbsphe believes the party could win the state if it had the correct candidate and was willing to spend up tp $100m on political advertising. He said the best candidates would be Mr Biden or Texan Beto O’Rourke, who has since dropped out.Mr Angle said this week his assessment had not changed, and that he believed it would be hard for the likes of Mr Sanders or Ms Warren to win in Texas.“I think Bernie Sanders has a ceiling in Texas,” he said. “I’ve been doing Texas politics a long time and I’ve seen how you win here, and how you lose. You don’t win by thinking you’re suddenly going to have this mass of new voters.”He added: “We have been plagued by people\u0026nbspfrom outside of Texas, coming here and telling us how to win, even though they have never ran a campaign here.”Democrats in China to hold primary online due to coronavirus outbreakSuper Tuesday: When is it, and why does it matter?“This is the most consequential election in the modern history or our country. We are not only going to win in Texas on Super Tuesday, we are going to beat ‘em in November. We are not going to have Trump for another term,” he told supporters at the Vic Mathias Shores park in Austin.According to the Statesman, he added: “The pundits tell us Texas is conservative state. I don’t believe that for a minute.\u0026nbsp“And I believe that if the working people of Texas, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American stand up and come out to vote, you’re gonna make this one of the most progressive states in America.”He said: “The limitations of our imagination are the crisis we face today.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Police officers rescued the residents and escorted them to a nearby station for their own safety but, outnumbered, retreated as the vandalism of the mosque began.“Look at my home, the whole thing is burnt, as well as all our possessions – clothes, utensils – everything,” he said. “There were 11 of us living here, what do I do now? Where will we go?”Videos then went viral of men chanting the Hindu nationalist slogan “Jai Shri Ram” (glory to Lord Ram) as the mosque was vandalised and two flags, one of India and the other showing the Hindu deity Lord Hanuman, were hoisted on its tallest minaret.Due to confusion over the name of the neighbourhood, the Delhi police mistakenly said on Twitter\u0026nbspthat this mosque had not been targeted and that the videos were “misinformation”, prompting the major right-wing channel Times Now to run unquestioningly a prime-time segment denouncing the “fake” footage – and those sharing it – on TV.Yet the buildings around the mosque were still smoking when The Independent met with the Muslim victims of the attack on Wednesday, as well as the Hindu neighbours who tried to protect them from the mob of “outsiders”.Khursheed, who works driving a battery-powered autorickshaw, said he does not blame Hindus for what happened, but rather the heightened tensions created by the Modi government’s new citizenship laws. Critics say the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and a planned National Register of Citizens (NRC), discriminate against Muslims and threaten India’s secular constitution.He and other residents said they didn’t recognise the attackers.\u0026nbsp“I don’t know the people who came and did this – it is all just politics,” he said. “I am just very sad for the situation my family is now in.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet seeing it gutted by fire was still not as painful as what the rioters did to the adjacent mosque.“We were targeted because we are Muslim,” she said. “All the shops belonging to Muslims were burnt, while none of the Hindu shops were touched. They want to single us out, to separate us from the other religions.”She said Hindus and Muslims in the neighbourhood had “never had any problems”.“We have always prayed together, Hindus and Muslims, in mosques and temples. We have always believed that we are all equal.”Like the other residents, Parveen says she bears no ill feelings for her Hindu neighbours, saying that when the mob first came from outside “they tried to save us”.I am just very sad for the situation my family is now inBut she says she doesn’t know whether the situation will calm down across the city after what happened. She is just thankful she wasn’t home to see the mosque attacked. “It is totally broken and burnt, we feel worse about that than what happened to our own homes. We were so surprised when we heard they targeted the mosque, we never thought that people could be capable of such a thing.”A little down the road from the burnt-out mosque, shattered shop fronts and piles of debris, a group of Hindu neighbours watch the clear-up and are nervous about speaking to the media.Trump to press India PM on anti-Muslim law Labour MP Abrahams denied entry to India and ‘treated like criminal’Death toll rises to 24 in Delhi riots with mosque set on fireModi on course for big defeat as Delhi rejects ‘poisonous’ campaignA 39-year-old man, who asked not to be named, said he welcomed prime minister Narendra Modi’s call for calm on Wednesday afternoon, but that it should have come on Monday.He admits the situation is “very tense”.\u0026nbsp“We have always been living together amicably here, there was no tension, we spent our childhoods together. Now these outsiders have come in and this has happened, and it is the people living here who have to deal with the tension.”He points to four armed police officers sitting outside the burnt-out mosque. “At least there is some protection now, but we were expecting it earlier. There should have been some procedure in place,” he saidFor some, though, the four officers provide little comfort. A Muslim man whose house across the road from the mosque was burnt, who did not give his name, said the violence had turned into “the most terrible outcome possible” for this neighbourhood.We were so surprised when we heard they targeted the mosque, we never thought that people could be capable of such a thingClearly nervous, he says he is only returning briefly to retrieve any key documents that – he hopes – may have survived the fire. “All the documents, all the possessions we have, we had to just leave them behind and just run for our lives,” he said. “If they are not there, how will I get a job?

We don’t like being treated as fools.If Harry and Meghan wish to be private citizens leading a quiet le in Canada, that’s fine. But that is not their ambition.By trading on their royal associations, they aim for global influence, wealth and fame. It is a goal that makes a mockery of all their protests about their need for privacy.When the Duke and Duchess first announced in January that they wanted to “step back” from public le, there was widespread sympathy for them.Their complaints that they struggled to cope with the limelight appeared convincing, particularly given Prince Harry’s admission of his mental health problems, fuelled by the trauma of his mother’s tragic death in .But that spirit of understanding is quickly evaporating as the couple reveal the full extent of their sense of entitlement and hostility towards the palace.In response to their ening catalogue of invented grievances, many Brits will be inclined to say, “Oh give it a rest,” or “good riddance.”Patience with the couple is at an end.The last straw was their outrageous reaction to the Queen’s decision that they would no longer be allowed to use the term “Royal” in their activities.This move was absolutely correct - the royal name is central to our national heritage.It is not a franchise to be exploited for personal gain, especially by a couple who have loudly proclaimed their determination to abandon their traditional royal roles.Before their wedding in May , they were indignant when the Queen rejected Meghan’s request for the loan of a certain tiara on the big day. “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” Prince Harry is reported to have said.But the Queen stood firm, just as she has done in the saga of the royal name.Her fully justied stance has pushed the spite and fury of the Sussexes to a new level, their anger made all the greater by the fact that they had spent thousands on their “Sussex Royal” website and merchandise.Their statements most notorious passage read, “While there is not any jurisdiction by the Monarchy or Cabinet Office over the use of the word Royal overseas, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use Sussex Royal.Who on earth do Harry and Meghan think they are to scold Her Majesty in such a patronising manner The truth is that they are talking political and constitutional nonsense.The monarch and the government certainly do have the right to restrict the use of the word “Royal” throughout the world.Its deployment is covered by a range of legislation like the Trade Marks Act and the Companies Act, as well as a host of international treaties like the  Paris Convention on Industrial Property.But on a deeper, more personal level, the Sussexes’ outburst was a profound insult to Elizabeth II as both our sovereign and a grandmother.Having given her whole le to the service of her country, she did not deserve to be treated like this.Her own example of self-sacrice during her record-breaking  years on the throne is in dramatic contrast to the self-indulgence of the Sussexes, who gave up after just  months.For all their moans about their burden, they never gave royal le as a married couple a chance.Their contempt for the palace shone through other aspects of their extraordinary statement. They wailed that other members of the royal family have been allowed to “seek employment outside the institution,” a blatant jibe at relatives like Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.But the whole point is that Meghan and Harry are not looking for normal jobs.If they were, they would not make such a fuss about their royal associations.Instead, they are hoping to cash in on their positions. That explains why the statement emphasised that Harry is “sixth-in-line to the throne.Without any hint of irony, they also boasted of their wish “to continue to represent and support Her Majesty”, when in reality they have wilfully placed the monarchy in turmoil.But for all the exhausting melodrama they have created, they still expect to be bankrolled by the taxpayer when it comes to their security, whose bill could reach £ million a year.Tellingly, they gave no indication of when they wouldthe £. million paid for the renovation of Frogmore, their property on the Windsor estate.All their laments feed into their carefully cultivated narrative of victimhood - but this is another invention.When they were first married, they were shown tremendous goodwill by the public and the media.Indeed, Kate Middleton had to put up with far more criticism when she first entered the royal family, partly because – unlike Meghan – she did not have her own successful career, and partly because of her middle-class background as the daughter of a former air hostess.“Cabin doors to manual,” snobbish courtiers allegedly sniggered behind her mother’s back.Yet through her modesty, determination, and elegance, the Duchess of Cambridge has grown into one of the monarchy’s greatest assets.“All the film people in the world, had they scoured the globe, could not have found one so suited to the part,” said Prime Minister Winston Churchill in  when the radiant Queen Elizabeth ascended to the throne. The same words could be used today about Kate now.Meanwhile, the Sussexes could be in for a shock. The world may not share their estimation of their brands appeal.Meghan herself was never a major star, while Harry has no unique talent to offer, especially now that he has become increasingly peevish and humourless. Nor is the public in either Britain or North America likely to lap up tirades about poverty and climate change delivered by a virtue-signalling, woke couple with an enthusiasm for private jet travel and a burgeoning property portfolio.The row over the royal name could just be the beginning of their troubles.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An inanimate object consisting of mesh and leaves bore the full, bilious brunt of virtue-signalling nastiness from those who have probably also been hash-tagging the crap out of #bekind for the past week.“If I was Yorkshire Tea I’d be very worried about my supporters all being racist Brexiteers — perhaps their super-Brit TV ad is responsible ” said one of the politer posts. Others advocated that the brand should be boycotted.A spokesman for Yorkshire Tea responded: “On Friday, the Chancellor shared a photo of our tea.Politicians do that sometimes . We weren’t asked or involved — and we said so the same day. Lots of people got angry with us all the same.”That’s because trolls aren’t interested in the whys, wherefores or, quite frankly, any context at all.They’re simply virtue-signalling from a position of self-bestowed righteousness to try to give meaning — via their target’s legion of followers — to their own sad existence.Yorkshire Tea’s response was impressively measured, but the last line has all of us thinking: “Who are these worrying idiots ”Last week it was reported that actor Freddie Fox was spat at in the street because of something his cousin Laurence said on the BBC’s Question Time.His cousin. Not even Laurence himself, who, by the way, should also be able to walk the streets without fearing physical or even aggressively verbal repercussions from someone who simply disagrees with his opinion.When moronic irrationality is restricted to the echo chamber of Twitter, it can be switched off and ignored.But when it spills out of the Twittersphere and impacts on a victim’s family or livelihood, then surely society as a whole must unite to stop it Because, one day, it could be you. Or, worse, your children.Former Met detective Philip Grindell was called in to help politicians deal with online abuse, which rose by  per cent last year.After retiring he helped a “global icon” who was scared for their le.“It was a famous person who was getting death threats,” says Philip, , who has now started a company called Dfuse Global to anticipate and assess the risk of online abuse.He discovered the death threats were coming from someone in the UK who had mental health issues and weren’t considered a risk to the personal safety of his client.Several years ago, Sky News confronted a woman who had repeatedly trolled the McCanns after the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine in .The woman, in her s, who had, “previously grappled with mental illness”, killed herself just days after being confronted.So tackling online trolling is clearly a minefield to navigate, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try.Just because much of it comes from a place of deep sadness or instability in the troll’s le, why should that allow them to inflict damage on other people with impunity This isn’t about disagreeing with someone’s views in a rational, well-argued way.It’s about downright nastiness and threats to someone’s mental or physical well-being. And it needs to be tackled by the State, not just private companies.We have to provide full ID before we board a plane, so why not insist on it when setting up an online account which must include our real name followed by a unique number Then, currently anonymous trolls might think twice before whipping up hate about someone they don’t even know and we can all drink our teain peace.OH gawd, here it comes again – the tyranny of a “no make-up” photo posted by Hollywood glitterati.Stop. It. Now.The latest salvo was fired by Gwyneth Paltrow, who hosted a “natural” dinner party to promote her well-being website Goop and invited, among others, Demi Moore and Kate Hudson.Demi, who has spent £squillion on cosmetic surgery, looked great. As well she might.Equally, I once got in a lt with Kate Hudson, who is quite simply one of the most stunning women I have ever seen.And then we have Gwynnie herself, who has the radiant glow of a woman who spends the national debt of a small country on skin treatments and products.The reality, of course, is that there’s little meaning to this “no make-up” dinner party other than for the attendees to show how great they look.Meanwhile, those dealing only with what God gave them remain judged by the sentiment once expressed by beauty guru Helena Rubinstein.“There are no ugly women, only lazy ones.”THE McDonald’s Quarter Pound- er Fan Clubhas plans to launch a range of candles with smells such as burger, ketchup and onion.That’s as “eeeeeeew” as Gwyneth Paltrow’s Smells Like My Vagina candle.The, er, burning question is: What’s wrong with the old stalwarts of fig or gardenia A FORMER friend of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell has told the FBI of a potentially relevant conversation they once had.“She said many things . . . ” reveals Christina Oxenburg.“Stuff like: ‘Jeffrey and I have everyone on videotape!’”Interesting.Could this perhaps explain Prince Andrew’s haste to cross the Atlantic and share a walk in the park simply to, he claims, break off the friendship with a man he also claims he didn’t know that well Or was it to find outthere were videos that he should be worried about from his time enjoying Epstein’s hospitality AL PACINO, , has been dumped by his -year-old girlfriend Meital Dohan.“I tried to deny it, but he is already an elderly man,” she says with refreshing candour.“So even with all my love, it didn’t last.”In other words, he’s very set in his ways, probably a little curmudgeonly at times and “the nursing years” are looming.THIS, believe it or not, is former “First Baby” Leo Blair – born when dad Tony was in situ at No Downing StreetIt feels like five minutes ago . . . but he’s now .Reasons to feel old: Part .THE maker of Barbie is bringing out three “inspirational women dolls” in the shape of ex-tennis champ Billie Jean King, hero nurse Florence Nightingale and singer Ella Fitzgerald, complete with “authentic clothing”.Nice idea, but let’s see how it pans out.Chances are they’ll end up in the “Barbie box” with all the others – dressed in a boob tube, sequined leggings and their hair in wonky plaits.Probably because we’d end up with a tuneless busker called Singy McSingface.THE WM Bar-B-Q Burger bar in Honolulu, Hawaii, has been serving its client favourite, the Royal Burger, since .Last time I looked they weren’t locked in litigation with The Queen.That’s because no one in their right mind would ever associate a burger restaurant with the British monarchy.The same, however, cannot be said of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.One of them was born royal, they both enjoyed a breathtakingly expensive royal wedding, undertook royal dutiesand received money from the Duchy of Cornwall, which the reigning son of the current British monarchinherits.So while Harry and Meghan’s little barb that The Queen doesn’t have legal jurisdiction in the US over the word royal is correct, the notion that their use of the word isn’t inextricably linked to the British crown is patent nonsense and Her Majesty is right to insist they drop it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The mob’s targets know no bounds.  This “woke elite” have made it impossible to have civilised conversation and debate.Take the feminist Germaine Greer, a woman who has fought tirelessly for some  years for women’s liberation. She is now considered by some to be too frightful to listen to and there have been calls to no- her — ban her from speaking at events, usually universities.Even companies such as Yorkshire Tea are getting stick.  The firm was bombarded with complaints at the weekend, with people expressing outrage because the new Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, posted a photo of himself on social media making a cup of tea with the brand.Sunak’s crime is being a Conservative. Yorkshire Tea’s crime was to allow the Conservative Chancel-or to drink its tea. This bizarre, unreasonable, moral crusading of what I see as the “woke elite” is part of the explanation for the Conservative landslide in the last election.In my view, the Labour Party lost  seats, the second largest number it has ever lost in a single election, because ordinary people look at the Left and think they have all gone mad.This isn’t true, of course. It is a great shame for sensible, left-leaning people in Britain that the woke are giving them all such a bad name.Those on the Left must cringe with horror every time there is a Twitter pile-on when someone does some- thing that “offends”.The woke march around asthey are police, bullying everyone into thinking and speaking in a way that they deem to be acceptable.If you don’t agree, they will write to your employer and get you fired, or they will bombard you with abuse until you give in and beg for forgiveness.I should know — it has happened to me more than once. If I tweet something that offends the woke elite, they write to my governing body, Ofsted, demanding my resignation.Luckily, on Twitter one can block these self-righteous radicals, giving oneself some peace. But there was a time when our school received so many savage and bloodthirsty emails that one of my office staff had a breakdown from having to read them all.We have even received death threats. Why  Because the woke elite don’t like how we run our school. As a headmistress, I believe it is important to teach children to hear all sides of any debate and encourage them to form their own, independent views.Butone side is constantly shutting down debate with bullying tactics, no-ing and drowning people out, then how are our children ever to hear both sides When we were first opening our free school, social justice warriors determined to stop us would infiltrate our parent evenings and stand up as I was talking, shouting over me so the parents couldn’t hear what I was trying to say.Why did they do this  Because in  I gave a speech at the Conservative Party conference. I am not a Conservative but that didn’t bother my detractors. As with Yorkshire Tea, simple association with the Conservative Party means you must be evil.The woke cannot imagine that the Conservatives want a better world, just as they do. They simply disagree on how to get there.So frequent and angry have the calls for someone’s dismissal or “cancellation” become that those who would have once argued the case, the “anti-woke”, are just rolling over. It’s not worth the hassle, they say with a sigh.The “anti-woke” weren’t always this way. They are ordinary people who have simply become fed up of being browbeaten by these pseudo-moral liberators.If the woke have something truly interesting to say, then why don’t they make their arguments, stand up on a stage and explain why their beliefs are worthy At least that would have the effect of persuading people, rather than alienating them.  But the woke don’t care about being virtuous. They want only to signal it.In , too many people live in fear of what they can and cannot say.

At the end of the last decade, men could expect to live . years and women were still well ahead on ..But in my patch, the North East of England, le expectancy for women has actually fallen a little.The report comes from a bloke called Sir Michael Marmot. He blames economic inequality and austerity for what he calls the UK’s “lost decade”.I have no doubt whatsoever that poverty shortens theof a le. And low wages — especially in the North East — mean that for too long people have been struggling by on very little indeed.But Sir Michael also has a bit of skin in the game. He has been arguing for decades about social inequality and its effects upon health.Fair enough. But this has given rise to headlines about evil Tories killing people. The usual stuff.If you listened to the coverage of his report on the BBC, you’d think Boris Johnson and co were wandering around the country strangling impoverished pensioners as they queue up in food banks. And cackling maniacally.But is it really quite so simple as that  Is it really all about poverty Sir Michael admits that  per cent might be attributable to new flu strains which have arrived here as a consequence of increased globalisation.Bird flu, Sars and now the coronavirus.That’s not all, though. As we keep being told, the country is in the grip of an obesity epidemic.And the areas where obesity is at its greatest are also those where le expectancy is at its lowest. Being fat isn’t the consequence of poverty. It’s a result primarily of a lack of exercise and, secondly, a poor diet.Given that the NHS and Government have been banging on about obesity for a decade, might not that have something to do with it, Sir Michael Then there’s alcohol. We drink a lot of it. And by and large it’s not terribly good for us. The trend in the past  years is that women are catching up with men in their intake. I wonderthat might also have an effect on those le expectancy tables  Again, nothing to do with poverty.What about women working  Le expectancy for men always lagged behind women — and we were told that this was because men went out to work.Now that women work too, would we not expect the le expectancies for each sex to draw closer together And then this. During the past  years we have welcomed more than six million immigrants to the UK. The le expectancy in their home countries is way below that of the average in the UK —  years below in the case of Pakistan, for example, and three years in the case of Poland. Many will arrive still with the legacy of poor health treatment in their original countries. That must, surely, affect the statistics.My argument isn’t that austerity isn’t in there somewhere. Simply that there are a few more factors to take into account before we blame the Tories, once again, for killing people.The bloke had just got back from Iran, where the virus has been spreading.

I didnt sense that he thinks this has all been a nightmare, Im going to hide away.From the reaction he got and the way he conducted himself, he clearly doesnt need a title to be a big deal.Harry this week ed to the UK for his final engagements before he and his we, Meghan Markle, officially step down as senior royals.The couple will no longer use their HRH titles, and last week agreed they wouldnt use the term Royal.Yet Ms Hazarika said even without his royal title, Prince Harry would still remain popular.GMB host Susanna Reid was quick to reply: Im not sure its about not liking them. But Harry is talking about sustainable travel, so rather than flying in why wouldnt you Skype into the conference But Ms Hazarika pointed out was about mitigating the impact of travel, rather than stopping it all together.She added: There were tonnes of experts from the travel industry there, they were just pleased to see him.He asked us just to call him Harry. He wanted to be accessible, informal and for people to come and chat to him.It was probably a nod to what youre talking about, but with the reaction he got, the way he conducted himself, he clearly doesnt need a title to be a big deal.She had shared a number of photos with her posing with Harry, who appeared keen to speak to fellow guests at yesterdays event.Flying in via a commercial flight to London on Tuesday night, Harry caught a LNER train to Edinburgh for the Wednesday sustainability conference.He spent the day promoting his Travalyst scoring system initiative that shows the eco-friendly status of aviation, accommodation and holiday experiences.The -year-old had previously faced criticism for talking about not making environmentally-friendly choices last year when he and Meghan took four private jet flights over  days.But when launching Travalyst Amsterdam last autumn, he defended his use of private planes, saying he spent  per cent of my le using commercial flights, but occasionally needed to ensure my family are safe.Yesterdays event is the first in a string of engagements for the sixth-in-line to the throne as he s to the UK for two weeks.On Friday, Harry will work with Jon Bon Jovi to record a song to promote the Invictus Games.And next week, he and Meghan will attend the Endeavour Fund Awards on March  in London while Prince William and Kate Middleton are in Ireland.The duke and duchesss lives as working royals will end on March , when they stop representing the Queen and become financially independent.As part of the Megxit deal, Harry must ditch his honorary military positions for at least  months.They have been allowed to keep their HRH titles but have been forced to accept that they will not use them publicly as they tout for business around the globe.The Sussexes have already agreed to repay the £.million of taxpayers’ money used to refurbish their Frogmore Cottage home in Windsor and are expected to pay a commercial rent for it of about £, a month.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Jenrick insisted such visits were a “distraction” which took resources away from the emergency services. But there was an awkward silence as he refused to say whether Prince Charles’ visit to meet families in South Wales whose homes had been devastated by Storm Dennis had been a “distraction.” And he wouldn’t answer when asked why Mr Johnson visiting now would be a “distraction”, but it wasn’t when he visited flood-hit towns in November, during an election campaign. Brandishing today’s Mirror, host Kay Burley said: “This is getting out of hand, now. This is the Prime Minister, I’m sure aides have shown this to you this morning. “‘Get a grip, you drip’ - they’re saying ‘where are you ’” She added: “These people, who are up to their armpits in muddy water, are saying ‘where is the Prime Minister ’” He is very much in control of events. Over  of my constituents were flooded two weeks ago. What they are very concerned to see is action. They want to see more funding for flood defences, Mr Jenrick said.  They are pleased that the Government has activated quite a substantial package of financial support. Those are the really meaningful things which personally I think are more important than the distraction of the Prime Minister turning up in an emergency situation.” Ms Burley asked: “So when the Prince of Wales went, that was a bad idea, was it ” Mr Jenrick paused, before saying: “Well, well…the Prime Minister visiting a flood situation can take away quite a lot of resources. That’s often the advice that’s given to the Prime Minister.”  Despite the country facing two crises - flooding and the spread of coronavirus - the PM still found time to roll out the red carpet for millionaires and billionaires at a party fundraising ball. Unnamed donors paid almost £, for two games of tennis with Mr Johnson in an auction at the event, alongside hunting trips and luxury holidays. The party raked in an estimated £, from table fees alone, as  attendees paid up to £, a table to rub shoulders with ministers and dine on fine food and costly wine.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailBritain and the EU have kick-started frantic talks on a Brexit trade deal as both sides lay out their demands. The EU published its -page negotiating directives on Tuesday - and now the UK has hit back with a -page document of its own. It confirms Boris Johnsonaposs plans to insist on full control over key areas including state aid, workersapos rights, environmental standards and fishing rights. And that means it heralds major rows over areas including business competition - the so-called level playing field - after No junked previous commitments to Brussels.Whataposs more, Boris Johnson will threaten to walk away from the talks as soon as Junethings are not moving fast enough.These are only the starting points, of course. If there is a trade deal, both sides will probably meet somewhere in the middle. Butthey start too far apart, itaposll scupper any hope of an agreement and weaposll be left high and dry. These talks are crucial for the future of the UK. If we donapost have a trade deal with the EU by  December , transitional rules will expire. That means itaposll be harder to travel, new checks will spring up, and billions of pounds worth of goods will be whacked with major tarfs as they pass through ports like Dover. Yet itaposs understood the UK government has no plan to publish an impact assessment of todayaposs planned deal. Meaning weaposll have little clue the extent of how it hits businesses and your family. Hereaposs our guide to the key sticking points in the coming talks - the areas where they could fall apart. . Fishing  WHAT THE EU SAYS: The EU wants to let EU fishermen continue fishing in UK waters - avoiding any economic dislocation. It wants a fishing arrangement to follow some EU laws. And crucially, it wants a new fisheries deal to be signed and ratied by  July . EU Brexit chief Michel Barnier said a free trade deal with the UK had to include fishing rights or there wonapost be any agreement at all. He added: Fisheries is part of a package as regards our trade relations, which are to be discussed, and that package is one you canapost break up. There will be no ambiguity at all around that.WHAT THE UK SAYS: The UK says Britain must become an independent coastal state. That means agreeing annual negotiations on access to fishing waters - and any EU vessels granted access to fish in UK waters would have to follow UK rules. The UK insists it wonapost trade away fishing rights infor a trade deal.. European courts  WHAT THE EU SAYS: To enforce the overall deal, the EU and the UK will have to agree to a dispute settlement system. The EU insists the European Court of Justice must have the final say on some disputes under this - and the dispute body must agree to follow whatever decision it makes.WHAT THE UK SAYS: The UK flat-out rejects this. The document says there will be no role for the ECJ in the dispute resolution mechanism or any of the arrangements reached between the two sides.. Extending the transition period  WHAT THE EU SAYS: The transition period will end on  December , but a joint committee can decide before July  this year to extend it by up to one or two years. EU chiefs have encouraged an extension, saying there isnapost enough time to figure out a full trade deal.WHAT THE UK SAYS: Britain has totally ruled out extension. Page four of the document states: The government will not extend the transition period. That effectively means that at the June summit,a deal doesnapost look likely by the end of the year, the UK will prepare to walk away with no trade deal.. Business competition  WHAT THE EU SAYS: The EUaposs big demand is a aposlevel playing fieldapos. This means having similar trade rules for both sides - and guaranteeing the UK canapost use leaving the EU to undercut its former partners to scoop up business. In , it would mean UK businesses get tarf-free access to EU markets. WHAT THE UK SAYS: The phrase level playing field doesnapost appear anywhere in the -page document. Britain says the trade deal should maintain effective competition laws - but this does not require regulatory alignment or linking the UKaposs rules to the EUaposs. The document explicitly adds: Both parties should have the regulatory freedom to respond to new and emerging challenges in these areas.If Britain signed up to the EUaposs request the implications would be far-reaching, limiting its abilities to strike wide-ranging deals with the rest of the world, including potentially the US.  . State aid WHAT THE EU SAYS: The EU wants the UK to keep following EU rules on aposstate aidapos - the amount of government support that can be given to industries like steel. Under EU rules, governments are allowed to provide state aid only with approval from Brussels. Any disputes would have to be dealt with through a joint process.WHAT THE UK SAYS: Britain rejects the idea of a binding aposlevel playing fieldapos - and the document proposes a more woolly commitment to be fair to both sides. It says any state-owned enterprises should operate in a fair and transparent manner and not discriminate against businesses in the other party.Effectively, theyaposre saying they wonapost sign up to EU rules, but within the terms of the agreement the UK and EU can agree not to drastically undercut each other. . Environment  WHAT THE EU SAYS: EU leaders say the UK must uphold all of Brusselsapos environmental standards that are in force as at  December . Britain would also have to commit to the EUaposs climate change targets where relevant.And the UK would need a system of carbon pricing to cost pollution that has at least the same effectiveness and scope as the EUaposs. Brussels wants Britain to simply link its emissions trading system to the EUaposs. WHAT THE UK SAYS: Again, Britain rejects a binding aposlevel playing fieldapos. Instead it calls for aposreciprocal commitments not to weaken or reduceapos environment standards on either side.. Workersapos rights  WHAT THE EU SAYS: The document says Britain must not lower any labour or social protection laws below the level of the EUaposs as at  December . Those include workplace rights health and safety consultation rules and fair conditions. This stops short of dynamic alignment - following EU rules as they change.WHAT THE UK SAYS: As with state aid and the environment, Britain agrees to include reciprocal commitments not to weaken workersapos rights laws. But the UK rejects the demand to follow EU laws, saying the agreement should recognise the right of each party to set its labour priorities and adopt or mody its labour laws.. A security treaty  WHAT THE EU SAYS: The EU wants to include security and defence as part of the talks on a trade deal. Thataposs because the UK has the upper hand in this, as one of the continentaposs leading powers.WHAT THE UK SAYS: A UK source confirmed the British government is unwilling to follow that path. We expect to cooperate closely with our allies, including the EU, the source said. We donapost think we need an institutional treaty framework to achieve this.The UK is only looking to discuss legal agreements on much narrower elements of security cooperation, including to be able to share sensitive and classied information with the bloc. Britain will also not take part in the European Arrest Warrant and instead develop a new system based on Norway and Iceland. .

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA desperate mum has described the terrying moment she had to fight with her nine-year-old son to stop him hanging himself while screaming that he wanted to die. Leanne Foote, , was so worried about Drew that she went for nights on end without sleep so she could keep an eye on him. Though it was a struggle to get medical help for Drew, who is now , he is now receiving expert therapy and Leanne believes their crisis is over – for the time being.  But the courageous mum is now reaching out to other families, to offer support. Drew’s ordeal was even discussed in parliament, as his MP pleaded for more money for children’s mental health services. Mum-of-four, Leanne, said: “There is nothing so frightening and challenging as hearing your own child say that they want to die. “Drew would scream at me that his ‘head was full’ and he couldn’t take it any more. “I felt so isolated, sitting up, all night every night, watching him, terried he might try to hurt himself. “I felt like I’d failed as a mum, like it was my fault somehow. “His condition has affected not just me but my other children too. My relationship broke down, some of my friends drted away they just couldn’t cope with the way Drew was.” Leanne suspected Drew had problems right from his birth in January . He screamed a lot and was a grizzly, unsettled baby.  Leanne, who also has two sons aged  and nine, and a -year-old daughter, says: “I had other children so I wasn’t a first-time mum. I thought he would grow out of it.” But by the time he started school, Drew was already showing extreme behaviour. He was excluded aged five for biting and attacking another child. He did not mix well with other children and had legendary meltdowns which caused one teacher to walk out of her job – on the first day. Leanne, from Cumbria, says: “I was mortied. My other children went through school without a single problem and this was such a shock for me.  “The school and the teachers were wonderful they were so supportive. They were sure Drew had autism but we had to wait a long time for funding for help. “In the meantime, I was left alone to cope. “Drew had major meltdowns and I was exhausted, looking after him and my other three children. “I was so tired I couldn’t even hold a conversation with anyone.  My older kids had to step in and help. I couldn’t even think about having a boyfriend because it would never work. It wasn’t fair on anyone.  “Drew was a lovely little boy with a great sense of humour and mischief, but he really struggled with anxiety and he would go into panic at the smallest thing. “He would only eat three or four simple foods anything  would send him into a spiral. He had to have his own bedroom in case he lashed out at his little brother, which meant the other kids were piled in together.” Aged eight, Drew was officially diagnosed with autism. Over summer , aged nine, he began threatening to kill himself.  Leanne says: “It was dreadful he’d say his head was full and he wanted to die and he was going to kill himself. He literally could not cope with what was in his own head. “One day, he had worked himself up into a state and that was when he started wrapping the hoover lead around his throat. “I had to fight with him to get it off him. “Even then, he talked about doing it again and I was terried he would find a way. I watched him all the time, even at night.” Drew was referred for mental health help but he waited over a year before a place became available. He is now receiving therapy and is also attending a specialist school where he is settled and happy.  Leanne says: “He is much better. He is happy and he adores his siblings. He is a loving, funny, gorgeous little boy. We went on holiday for the first time ever recently and Drew had so much fun. “He struggles with friendships, he always will, but he is learning to cope with that.

One passenger told Birmingham Live they were left feeling aposlike a prisonerapos while another said her aposheart sankapos at the news.Travellers - including families with young children - claimed they were not given an opportunity to leave the plane as they were flown to an airport , miles from home. They were put up in a hotel overnight and were expected toto Birmingham yesterday - but say Jet had aposfailed to communicate effectivelyapos. The airline said its teams were working apostirelesslyapos to get everyone to their destination as soon as possible. Passenger Helen Jenner said aposit should have been a th birthday to rememberapos - but instead she ended up stranded in Portugal. Helen told BirminghamLive: I understand the sandstorm was out of their hands - but the communication from the Jet office to the ground staff is appalling. We should have departed on Sunday, then Monday, then we were told it would be Tuesday. On Tuesday, we were picked up at pm and taken to the airport, which was manic. It took two hours to check in and cases were not weighed, just tagged. In the departure lounge there was not a seat to be had and no information on the time of the flight. At pm I was starting to lose my patience - no information whatsoever. I went to the Jet desk where again the front line staff were at the receiving end of customersapos anger. They did not know the situation either. At .pm our flight was called to board from Gate . At pm we boarded, but at .pm the pilot tells us aposnot good news folks - weaposre not going to Birmingham tonightapos. Passengers were groaning and my heart sank.  Due to the hours the crews had worked, they could not go for four hours - instead hotel accommodation had been arranged in Faro. We landed in Portugal at .pm and were herded through the airport through passport control to waiting buses. The hotel we were put up in was a -minute drive away, we got there at gone midnight - food was there but who wants to eat a meal at am  This should have been a th birthday to remember, instead it was spoiled by Jetaposs failure to communicate effectively. What are they playing at  How is this considered duty of care  Ruth Abbott - whose husband George was also among passengers on the same flight - hit out at Jet. She slammed the airlineaposs aposshocking lack of communicationapos telling BirminghamLive: George and his friend Daniel had been due to fly back on Sunday but their flight was delayed owing to the sandstorm. That was understandable and couldnapost be helped.  But since then, they have been given next-to-no information. Their flight was delayed until Tuesday, when they were eventually put on a plane and the doors shut - only for the pilot to tell them they wouldnapost be ing to Birmingham as he didnapost have enough aposflight hoursapos left. My husband said he felt like a prisoner on that plane. They were given no option of getting off the flight before it took off. Instead, all the passengers - which included families with young children - were taken to Portugal. They were put up in a five star hotel on Tuesday night - which was lovely - but the passengersapos luggage was all left behind in Tenere.George is without his blood pressure medication which is packed in his suitcase as he believed heaposd be back in Birmingham by now.Their lack of communication has been shocking.

People are dying left and right over there from that disease on both ends patients and doctors. Please grow the f*** up. But others were quick to defend the coupleaposs use of humour to deal with the distressing situation. One supporter said: These people are in far more danger of contracting the disease than you are, yet youaposre telling them how they should be coping with it. Dumb AF. Another added: Get over yourselves. Sometimes the only way to get through a terrying situation is to find the comedy in it. Did you miss the part where they said that theyaposre currently living in China  These two are at signicantly greater risk of getting infected by coronavirus than .% of the commenters here. Max, from Dartford, Kent, explained why they posted the photos. We were trying to laugh at the virus, he said. Not at the people who are suffering, but at the circumstance we find ourselves in. Loraine, who comes from Calornia, said: At the end of the day they donapost know the situation. Theyaposre commenting from afar. From a place of luxury I think at this point. They donapost know what it feels like to be cooped up at home, to have that fearyou go out or come into contact with something [that could be] contaminated.  I think we know how much we have contributed, to help out in this situation that weaposre in. I thinkanyone has a comment to say against it then thataposs their opinion. We took the picture for ourselves. They saw a snapshot but they donapost know anything . They donapost know what weaposve done, how we feel. Everyone in the community they live in is required to wear a mask and their temperatures are checked every time they go to the supermarket. The couple has tried to make a positive contribution in their province of Shandong, which the World Health Organisation said had  confirmed cases as of February . Over the past few weeks theyaposve solicited donations for medical supplies from the UK and America and volunteered with the Weihai Health Bureau designing awareness posters and doing translation work.  Recently, they tried to visit a friendaposs apartment but were turned away by security. Even the self-described aposhomebodiesapos have had enough of what they described as the aposlove lockdownapos. Loraine said: For us coronavirus is an hourly thought. Especially because of [our dog] Jojo. We take him out for walks, and every time we go outside we think, OK, be careful of what we touch. [We] donapost even touch the elevator button. So itaposs constantly in the back of our head how to stay safe, how to protect each other. Iaposm just very grateful to be in this situation with someone I love. Max and Loraineaposs whirlwind international romance began just before Christmas in  when they hit it off at a party aimed at foreigners in Weihai. Nine months later they were married.  Loraine said she did seriously consider leaving China when Coronavirus first hit. The couple had been visiting her family in the Philippine, and Max flew back a week early to take care of the dog. It was Jojo, Loraine said, who ultimately convinced them to stay. Without the option of a direct flight to the UK or US, it would be extremely dficult to leave with their beloved pup, who is also looking forward to the barricades coming down. Loraine said: Iaposd love to take Jojo on a walk along the beach. His normal routes.

Their childaposs primary school and a medical practice visited by the patient have both closed for deep cleans amid fears that others in Buxton could have been infected. Burbage Primary School alerted parents and carers in a text message, saying a parent had been diagnosed with the flu-like virus. About a mile away, Buxton Medical Practice closed as a precaution, with a voice message telling prospective patients to stay away. A video on Twitter allegedly shows the patient being whisked away in a convoy of emergency services vehicles at about .pm on Wednesday after being picked up by medics in protective suits. Have you been affected by coronavirus in Buxton  Email webnews@mirror. It came as Public Health England confirmed two more cases in the UK, bringing the total to . The other person was in a London hospital after catching the virus in Italy. In Buxton, it is understood the parent had recently ed to the town of , from Tenere after staying at the H Costa Adeje Palace Hotel, where four Italian tourists tested positive for coronavirus this week. Britons are among about  guests in a -day quarantine and there are fears the virus could sweep through the hotel like it did the Diamond Princess cruise ship while it was quarantined in Japan. Burbage Primary Schoolaposs head, Anthony Tierney, was on site to speak to concerned parents on Thursday morning. He confirmed that the gates would remain closed for the day. It is understood the school may not reopen until Monday at the earliest.  Mr Tierney said: We are shut, it is just a precaution. I canapost say anything more at the moment. Panicked parents took to social media after receiving the bombshell message which was sent out just before pm on Wednesday night. Many complained about the lack of a full explanation as to whether the infected parent had actually been on the school premises. The school, which has  pupils and  members of staff, gave no further details about the coronavirus victim. The message sent to parents and carers read: Due to a confirmed case of coronavirus amongst our parent population, Burbage Primary School will be closed as a precautionary measure to enable a deep clean to be completed.  “A further update will be shared tomorrow.” At first some parents thought the message was a hoax, which lead to hundreds of messages on Facebook and Twitter. But one parent posted: My daughter goes to the school. I can confirm that the school have put out the message to parents. They have also asked people not to post hysterical messages on social media. A parent criticised the online speculation, writing on Facebook: It may be precautionary and the parent may not have been on the premises but has a child at the school who has been exposed to the virus. The virus is transmittable before any symptoms are shown so to give no context or further explanation is irresponsible!!But another parent replied: What context is missing  Parent infected, their kids at the school. Virus can infect without symptoms early on. School closes to get cleaned. Whataposs missing  A dferent parent criticised the speculation about the seriousness of the situation before any further details were released. I feel for the staff and headmaster who will have to deal with the members of the public who are now worrying over precautionary measures, she wrote. Another replied: Why shouldnapost they worry  Itaposs contagious before symptoms show. If the parent has it then likely the child children do also. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Buxton Medical Practice said: We have a confirmed case of the coronavirus.  We are liaising with Public Health England and the CCG to ensure all appropriate actions are taken. Please do not come to the practice.The practice later wrote on Facebook: Just a quick update to say we have talked to Public Health England and their advice is that we should be able to open tomorrow after a deep clean today. We are also advised that there is currently no need for additional testing for patients or staff. Thank you for your patience. Members of Derbyshire County Councilaposs emergency planning team were called into the authorityaposs headquarters in Matlock early to deal with the issue. A spokesman for the council said: We are aware of the reports and are awaiting confirmation from Public Health England.  We will release further information as soon as we get it.Local resident Zoe Milly Jones posted video on Twitter showing two paramedic vehicles with their flights flashing as the patient was taken to Royal Liverpool Hospital. Medics had stopped at a Morrisons petrol station to put on hazmat suits before collecting someone from a property in Buxton. Ms Jones wrote: Just followed two ambulances and two response units from Stockport, to Buxton on blue lights in convoy.. where men in Hazmat suits entered a property, and seemingly put someone in an ambulance. Then blue light convoyed back to stockport. Could it be #coronavirus in #buxton.  She told : The first place I saw them, where I took the video was on the A, in Hollingworth.They turned right onto the A heading toward Glossop. I followed them the entire way, as it looked suspicious.The ambulances stopped on Morrisonsapos petrol station in Buxton at first.Where they changed into white suits. Then they moved onto the house in Buxton, where someone got into the ambulance.Then they convoyed back on blue lights again. I followed them all the way back. They went into a loading bay at Liverpool Royal Hospital. Another resident wrote on Facebook: Just Seen  ambulances in convoy coming from buxton way with lites but driving slow all staff at mask on anybody know why anybody know why.  Hailed as a gateway to the Peak District National Park, Buxton is set in north-west Derbyshire, about  miles south-east of Manchester. Residents were shocked when they found out that someone amongst them was infected with the disease. Lynne Gracie, who lives close to the primary school, told DerbyshireLive: “The news has left me gobsmacked. My thoughts and sympathy go out to all affected.It’s a popular school and has just had new classrooms.“I don’t mingle with the school community, I don’t have children but I can understand their concerns. It’s a worrying situation.” Ruth George, who represents Whaley Bridge on Derbyshire County Council, appealed for calm.  She wrote on Facebook: “It’s important that we don’t panic about the coronavirus, but we also need to do all we can to protect people. “Thank you to Burbage School in Buxton for taking sensible precautions. I hope that parents - and their employers - will understand the need to make sure this highly infectious virus doesn’t get spread.” Public Health England said the UKaposs two new cases involved a patient who ed from Tenere and a second who had been in Italy, where  people have died amid the worst contagion in Europe. Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said: Two further patients in England have tested positive for COVID-, bringing the total number of UK cases to . The virus was passed on in Italy and Tenere and the patients have been transferred to specialist NHS infection centres in Royal Liverpool Hospital and the Royal Free Hospital, London. So far in the UK more than , people have been tested for the virus and of the  to have tested positive, eight have so far been discharged from hospital. About  schools have closed for at least one day this week and around  others - including Prince Georgeaposs in south London - have sent some staff and students home to self-isolate. In most cases, it is because pupils and staff recently ed from ski trips in northern Italyaposs red zone. Prince George and Princess Charlotteaposs primary school, Thomasaposs Battersea, has sent pupils home as a precautionary measure following trips to northern Italy. But schools and businesses have been urged not to overreact. Public Health England said that its general advice is not to close schools - a message echoed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Guidance was sent to UK employers telling them staff who are asked to self-isolate are entitled to take sick leave. Coronavirus has been spreading across Europe this week, with Italy becoming the epicentre with more than  people infected and  dead. The northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto have been locked down. Travellers ing to the UK from northern Italy were told they may need to self-isolate as part of measures to stop the spread of illness. No plans to rescue Brits Elsewhere, the Foreign Office denied there were any plans to evacuate around  Britons who remain in the coronavirus-hit hotel H Costa Adeje Palace Hotel in Tenere. However, it has arranged for written messages to be put under the doors of the rooms of British guests asking them to get in contact.Some Britons who are trapped at the hotel for two weeks have now begged Boris Johnson to send a plane to rescue them. About  guests from  countries are stuck there during the quarantine. Disease specialists have said the new coronavirus cases are not surprising and the UK should expect more infected patients without direct China links as the virus continues its spread in Europe. Experts re-emphasised there is no due cause for alarm and said the most important act for iniduals is regular, thorough hand-washing and immediately binning tissues which have been coughed and sneezed on. Professor Rowland Kao, chairman of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said: We already have evidence of onward transmission occurring outside of China and so these two cases - associated with situations with high levels of infections - are not surprising. This occurrence should therefore already be well within the scope of the current approach to control. It does highlight that we should continue to expect more cases without direct association with China, and therefore, despite evidence of the epidemic tailing off in China, a need for continued vigilance with appropriate control measures for some time.

Schools have been closed after pupils and staff ed from ski trips in Italy, sparking fears they could have caught the killer bug and brought it back to the UK. Hundreds of workers have also been sent home from a London office after an employee showed symptoms similar to coronavirus. Fears over the virus has led to hand sanitisers flying off the shelves nationwide and major retailers selling out of face masks. As many of us consider wearing the masks, especially in situations like our commute, an expert has revealed whether they will be effective in preventing you from picking up the virus.  Dr Jake Dunning, head of emerging infections and zoonosesat Public Health England, told The Independent there is aposvery little evidence of a widespread benefitapos in wearing the masks.Many of the paper options being worn do not filter out infectious air particles, and those that are not worn properly or are loose fitting will not prevent bacteria from entering your nose or mouth. Experts have also warned that the virus can be contracted through the eyes. Jimmy Whitworth, professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, also said there is little evidence the masks will help prevention, and are better used by those who already have the virus to prevent it spreading. Medical professionals who come into close contact with the coronavirus will usually be wearing more heavy-duty masks, which can filter out unwanted particles and are specically fitted to the weareraposs face.

Soraya Owen-Brown spent nearly three months bouncing from doctor to doctor as her distressed mum pleaded with medics to find out why her daughter was sickly.Last week Nikita Owen-Brown was given the news all parents dread - Soraya has an atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour – a rare and aggressive brain tumour, Grimsby Live reports.She has also been diagnosed with hydrocephalus – a condition in which cerebrospinal fluidaccumulates within the brain. The nine-month-old is today undergoing le-saving brain surgery, followed by chemotherapy treatment. As a result of her daughter’s ordeal, Nikita is campaigning for “mother’s intuition” to be taken seriously by the NHS. The mum-of-four, from Immingham, north east Lincolnshire, said: “If one of those GPs had listened, just one, my baby wouldn’t have had weeks of pain she couldn’t tell me about. “The hydrocephalus may not have been so severe and her tumour would have been smaller. Soraya’s symptoms began in mid-December with a cough.  Nikita said: “I spent five-and-a-half hours in AE and was told it was probably just a viral infection.” However, almost two weeks on, her condition continued to worsen and a discharge started leaking out of her ear before she developed a weakness in her left side. Nikita rushed Soraya to the doctor who said her daughter probably had a “viral infection”. She said: “They couldn’t see her ear because there was too much debris. They swabbed her ear and gave us antibiotics and started us off with ear drops.  “They said there was nothing remarkable about her ear and it was just a viral infection.” But her “mother’s intuition” told her Soraya’s condition was more than just a viral infection. She added: “My beautul Soraya had been poorly for weeks. I had seen eight dferent GPs, some two or three times. “I had told each and every doctor: ‘She isn’t right, do something’. Every single time I was told: ‘She’s fine’ or ‘Viral infection’. “I think viral infection is clearly doctor speak for ‘I don’t know’. “Eventually, Soraya developed muscle weakness in her left side, stopped eating and regressed on her milestones. “Fast forward to now, my baby has a brain tumour and hydrocephalus.”Nikita wants a “mother’s intuition” to be taken seriously by the NHS so has launched a petition –  Soraya’s Law  – and has gained more than  signatures in under one week. The petition reads: “My aim is for mothers to be listened to and taken seriously, making a mother’s intuition a genuine diagnostic tool for the NHS. “There is not a person in the world who will know a baby like their mummy. “As a mother, it is impossible not to know your child inside out. We can read our children like books. “So when a mother is so convinced her child is poorly, why donapost doctors listen   “Donapost let your baby suffer like mine did. “There is no such thing as a apostext book babyapos and GPs need to acknowledge and learn from that. “Mama knows best.”A Go Fund Me page and public Facebook group called Sorayaaposs Army   have also been set up to support the family emotionally and financially through the ordeal."},{"url":null,"title":"greggs customer who dropped paper","story":"NewsGreggs customer who dropped paper bag after snack hauled to court  years laterGrace Firth, now a -year-old student from Stockport, had no idea that a tasty Greggs snack a decade ago had seen her convicted in her absence and she was forced to make a trip to court this weekShareCommentsByJoseph WilkesReporter:,  FEB NewsA quick snack more than a decade ago has come back to bite this woman \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Spanish authorities isolated the Costa Adeje Palace Hotel on the Canary Island after an Italian doctor staying there was diagnosed with the virus. His we has also tested positive. Around  Brits who headed to the resort for some winter sunshine have now found themselves on a -day lockdown after a note was pushed underneath guestsapos room doors. Twenty-two Britons have been told to take their own temperatures and said there is confusion over whether they should stay in their rooms. Guests were sunbathing in masks and enjoying free supplies of food and alcohol at the hotel poolside after learning they would be staying well into March. Are you in the hotel  Email webnews@mirror  Police are still patrolling the complex to enforce the lockdown. Some at the hotel have been handed thermometers and told to write down their own readings, while some people are moving around the hotel and going to the pool and restaurant. One couple, Janet and Chris Brett, from Leicestershire, are among those in isolation - saying guests are being made to stay in their rooms with packaged meals left at their door. Mr Betts told LeicestershireLive: The first we knew about it was when we had a letter in several languages pushed under our door. At first I thought it was a joke but then when I went down to reception - it was full of police and security so we knew it was serious. There are police on every corner. It’s total lockdown. At first we were able to to go down to the pool area but now we can’t so we are sitting tight in our rooms trying to pass the time. Packed meals are being brought to us and left at the door but we have no idea how long we will be here. At the weekend we were hit by a sandstorm here so it’s proving to be an eventful holiday. I said on Monday ‘I’m having a lovely time and I wish I could stay a bit longer.apos It’s a real case of ‘be careful what you wish for.’Mr Betts, , and Mrs Betts, , say they feel well and have none of the coronavirus symptoms. He said: “Medical staff came round last night and took our temperature and gave us face masks. “We feel fine. “We are not too worried because it looks like coronavirus is serious for the very old and those with underlying health conditions. “I’ve got a few years on me but we’re in good health generally.” Mr Betts said boredom was the big challenge for them.  He said: “We’ve got the telly, and access to the internet and books. We can speak to some of the other guests by phone – we are here with friends from Sunderland - but it’s a bit boring. “You have to think how lucky you are because there are those people stuck on that cruise ship in Japan while we are here in a nice hotel room. Mr Betts said he had a view of the area where deliveries are made to the hotel from his room. He said: “You can see all the food coming in so we know we’re not going to starve. “They sent  staff home yesterday afternoon but there are still people here. “We can see their families coming to the top of the street and delivering overnight bags with clothes to the police who then bring them here. “It all feels really strange.  Fears are intensying over the spread of coronavirus in Europe as France reported its second death and the number of people in Italy with the virus continues to climb. Authorities in Italy have reported that the number of people infected in the country grew to , or up % in  hours, and  people have now died. Austria, Croatia and Switzerland also reported their first cases linked to the outbreak in Italy, while Spain and France recorded new ones, also involving people who had been to northern Italy. France recorded its second death, a -year-old Frenchman who died in a Paris hospital.  The first positive test in South America has also been recorded in a -year-old Brazilian man who had recently been to northern Italy. For the first time, the number of new cases officially reported outside China has exceeded new cases reported by Beijing, Reuters has reported. It said figures from the World Health Organisationshowed there were  new cases reported in  countries on Tuesday, compared with  reported by Beijing. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs on Wednesday that , people in the UK have so far been tested. Of these,  have tested positive, of whom eight have been discharged from hospital. He said the NHS is looking to extend home testing while a new public information campaign will be launched. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Hancock suggested that home testing will be rolled out more widely to complement existing hospital testing and the isolation pods which have been sited at hospitals in England for people who turn up at AE with symptoms.

The horric encounter left victim Declan Bryan, , fighting for his le and he has since been struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder , Lincolnshire Live reports. Shocking pictures show the extent of the injuries he sustained when he was assaulted by Alin-Ionut Apostu and Alexandru Mocanu in the early hours of December  last year in Lincoln. The former doorman was walking home after being out with friends when the pair sexually assaulted one of the women in the group. “We were coming home from a night out – there was myself, two girls and a male friend, Declan said. “We were walking down the street and I gave one of the girls my shoes and the other my jacket to help them walk home. “One of the girls was quite drunk so we had to pick her up and carry her, and in doing so her skirt rode up a bit. The first one touched her and then the second one did it. He told the men their behaviour was unacceptable in an attempt to peacefully defuse the situation.  But Apostu and Mocanu then lashed out at Declan and attacked him and the other woman who was in the group. I told them to f-off, that that was sexual assault and they could go to prison, he continued. “I tried to usher them away. I used to be a doorman, so I know how to dfuse situations. I didnapost become aggressive, I didn’t want any violence. I thought we had resolved it. He says the younger man then began to apologise and even shook his hand - but after starting to walk away, came back and punched him.  “He started walking away, then he punched me from the side. The other punched me from the front and that’s all I remember. The next thing I knew I was waking up in a puddle of blood.” He then blacked out but has since been told the pair aposused his head as a footballapos and that he was very lucky to survive. Apostu and Mocanu kicked and stamped on Declan’s head before Apostu knocked one girl unconscious when she tried to pull them off him. He then proceeded to sexually assault her while she was motionless on the ground - before karate kicking the other girl in the head.  When Declan woke up, he was surrounded by passers-by who had come to help him. There were people around me,” he said. “I didn’t know what was happening and how I had got there. “I woke up and was trying to make sure my friends were okay. Then I looked down at my feet and I was wondering where my shoes went. I was confused as to why there was so much blood.” Both men were jailed over the incident on Tuesday, February  at Lincoln Crown Court. Everyone that has seen the CCTV footage of the attack – the police, the barristers – has said I’m lucky to be alive,” Declan continued. They used my head as a football. My friend tried to stop them and they tackled her to the floor. It was disgusting and it was shocking to watch it back. Even being a doorman it’s one of the worst attacks I’ve ever seen without people using weapons. I couldn’t believe that anyone could do that to anyone when there was nothing to aggravate them. Declan - who suffers from a genetic disorder called Von Willebrand disease, which means his blood doesn’t clot as well as it should - says the attack could have killed him. I could have bled to death, he said. I had severe bruising to the face and my eyes. I couldn’t open one of my eyes for a while, I had a laceration to my left eyebrow which has scarred. The attack has also had a profound effect on Declan and his friendaposs mental health, and he has had to give up work and move back in with his parents in Friskney, near Boston. My family have been brilliant and my friends have been understanding with everything. I’m trying to relax with it all and trying to start again, he continued. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD. I found it out the hard way – I tried to go back to work as a doorman and I started having a panic attack while on my sht. I had to be sent home and haven’t gone back since. I haven’t been able to go out, I haven’t been able to go into places with large crowds. I will need counselling. I already suffer from anxiety and depression so was on medication but I’ve had to up this. We’ve all been talking with each other to try and help each other through it. Apostu,  and Mocanu, , both from Lincoln, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting the woman.

She also apparently fears she and Harry are being apospicked onapos over their wish to step down from the royal family and the Palaceaposs restrictions are apospaybackapos for them quitting. The former Hollywood actress allegedly complained to her closest confidants about the issue before releasing her extraordinary statement on Friday, complaining they are being treated dferently to other royals.Meghan said that [she and Harry] were left with no choice but to make a public statement, a friend told the Mail Online .  She saidanyone should feel insulted, it should be them. They never intended to capitalise on the word royal, and to insinuate they were somehow abusing their privileges is absurd. The Duke of Sussex is currently in Edinburgh for final engagements as a working royal before the official split in the spring, but the Duchess will not be travelling to Scotland and instead catch up with him in London.  The insider told the Mail Meghan has no issues about being in the UK after their aposabdicationapos following a bombshell statement in January revealing their desire to quit as royals.  The source went on to say: Meghan is going straight to London, not Edinburgh because thataposs Harryaposs thing.  She said she and Harry will continue to rise above jealousy and pettiness and focus on the good they are creating and on being the best parents to Archie.  She said she will continue to champion Harry because out of everyone, he has the most integrity and the most loyalty. Meghan also believes Her Majesty was under pressure to make those demands about the name change, as Harry is her favourite and others just canapost deal with it, the friend added.  Last week, the Queen banned them using the word aposroyalapos in their Sussex Royal aposbrandingapos with the Mail previously reporting Meghan had grumbled to friends there was nothing legally stopping them defying her.  The statement released in retaliation by the Sussexes, who could be set to make millions in foreign endorsements, said neither the Monarchy nor the Cabinet has jurisdiction over use of the word aposroyalapos overseas - adding, however, they would not be using the term.  While The Duke and Duchess are focused on plans to establish a new non-profit organisation, given the specic UK government rules surrounding use of the word ‘Royal’, it has been therefore agreed that their non-profit organisation will not utilise the name ‘Sussex Royal’ or any other iteration of ‘Royal.’ For the above reason, the trademark applications that had been filed as protective measures and that reflected the same standard trademarking requests as done for The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have been removed.

Workers at Stockport Village Nursery, now home to an incredible eight sets of non-identical and one pair of identical twins, believe their preschool in Stockport, Greater Manchester, is the only one in the UK to have ever looked after this many at once. They were amazed when they realised they had three sets of twins attending at the same time - and thought they were seeing double when six more later arrived, all from the same area. Weaposve always had a lot of twins but when we had three sets we were quite shocked so to have nine is something , says nursery manager Lyndsey Cross, . We must be the only nursery in the UK to have this many - weaposve never had this many at once before. The twinsapos ages range from five months to four years old - with Lottie and Gracie Catterall being the youngest of the lot.

Iaposve never heard of so many twins at a nursery, the -year-old said. Sometimes, because there are so many of them,they donapost come in matching outfits I donapost like it. When theyaposre all together, they just sit looking around at each other like theyaposre thinking aposoh, youaposve got a twin tooapos. To reduce confusion, each set of twins has been assigned to a dferent member of staff.  Although the youngsters often arrive in matching outfits, as they arenapost all identical there is thankfully no need for name tags. Thanks to a sibling discount, Lyndsey says the nursery have always had lots of twins, but previously their highest number at once was just three. We think itaposs quite funny and itaposs quite unusual. There must be something in the water, she continued. It can be confusing for staff but thankfully they arenapost all identical so we can tell the dference and one set belong to a member of staff.

It is in one of the printed out scans that the unborn baby girl is showing her cheeky side.  Sheaposs sticking her tongue out here, Dad Noel says while grasping a picture of the baby. Another photo shows the child with two fingers stuck up in a v-sign. And this one, Oscar says sheaposs giving the peace sign, Noel says. Thataposs not what mum thought.

However medics say there is no hope of repairing her eyesight, and said she will soon be fully blind. She said: Unfortunately, for now doctors do not give me much optimism for improvement.

He has undergone a similar eye tattoo.According to Polska , Aleksandra has undergone three procedures aimed at restoring her sight, but discovered that the dye had gone into her tissue. The ink used was only suitable to be used on skin, it is claimed, and should not come into contact with the eyeballs.

praise, and rightly so, he’s made a huge dference at the back.Crucially, though, the rest of the team have also upped their game.Jordon Forster has been excellent in the last three matches, heading and kicking anything coming his way with one of each of those resulting in the opening goal in the last two games.Josh Meekings is also looking like getting back to the player we all know he can be

minute of taking on the big boys in the Championship.I have to admit I expected them to drop away as the season wore on but they are showing the kind of durability that can see them take a place in

sought to build a daycare centre alongside three retail units at Dunsinane Industrial Estate, to the west of the Peter Vardy car dealership.Planning approval for all of the units was granted two years ago following a battle with council officers later resolved by the Scottish Government.At present the development # known as Angus Court # is home to a Starbucks drive-through, a Greggs bakery and a Domino#s Pizza takeaway.However, the fourth unit, permitted only to operate as a nursery, is yet to find a tenant.Westport Property, which has been managing the letting-out of the unit, says it has

letter to Joup last month, the firm#s Fergus McDonald said: #Despite some initial interest from Aberfoyle Nursery, Balgillo Nursery, Rainbow Bright Childcare and Acorn Day Nursery, the general feedback we received from the market was simply that the accommodation lacks the necessary external space and play area, is too expensive to fit-out and has too much in the way of competitors situated close by for nursery use.#Other uses such as dental practices, veterinary groups and pharmacies were considered before letting bosses concluded that there was #strong demand# from the leisure and food sector.However, it is likely council officers will oppose the use of another unit for non-industrial use, contrary to the city#s Local Development Plan.The LDP acts as a blueprint for the city#s vacant sites, and is typically rigorously enforced by city planners.Planning agent Bidwells, speaking to the council on behalf of Joup, has pleaded with them to make an exception in order to create up to  new jobs.In a statement, the firm said: #The very fact that three of the four units at Angus Court are already occupied by such uses indicates that the change of use of this unit would provide a strong cluster of such uses, all in one sustainable location, where local employees would be able to access a choice of such uses, in a convenient manner, and without the need to travel further

of cost-saving measures earlier this week ahead of its budget next week, is set to receive around £.m extra.Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden previously warned the authority would have to save £m over the next  months.Reacting to the news of the agreement, he said: “I welcome any extra money for Aberdeen City Council.“That will take the deficit down to around £ million, which just shows the extent of the underfunding the council had in the original budget put forward.“The extra money is of course to be welcomed, but it is certainly not enough.”Meanwhile, Aberdeenshire Council, which revealed a funding gap of £m, will receive more than £.m as part of the agreement.Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin said: “This budget is a good deal for Aberdeenshire and a good deal for Scotland – and I’m delighted it is now set to receive the support of the Scottish Parliament.“The north-east will benefit from our share of an extra £m for local government.“The Scottish Government had already backed Police Scotland with a budget increase of £m.“That will now increase that support to £m overall with £m of investment for frontline services.“We have made signicant investments to tackle the climate

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

An enhanced community care model is an excellent idea # but healthcare professionals are adamant that Knapdale Ward should be retained, with improvements made in discussion with staff.It is needed, they say, as an option within Argyll when the home environment is no longer suitable for dementia sufferers, their families and carers.Serious questions need to be answered.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"customers-stuck-tesco-lift-two-hours","story":"TESCO have vowed to keep their Galashiels lt out of operation until a full inspection is carried out.The announcement

finances required for a new Peebles High School.Local Conservative council leader Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held against the backdrop of a cut to our capital budget this year of  percent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"former-melrose-winger-backs-murrayfield-abseil","story":"A SUPERHERO abseil down the Murrayfield

Denis Brett, and his we Katherine , Denis Roland Brett was born in  in Dehri Dun, India, where his father was serving with the Leicestershire Regiment.At the age of seven he was sent to Blairmore preparatory school in Aberdeenshire, then on to Haileybury School in Hertfordshire. There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs.

You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength.

All that wee and poor Scotland would be able to afford would be wall-to-wall White Heather Club, interspersed with speeches from Alex Salmond.You can see where Irsquom going with this, canrsquot you :He acts the clown but Boris Johnson is a Bolshevik about powerThe former BBC Director-General, John Birt, said that Scots might not be able watch the BBC at all. Well, as it turns out perhaps no one will. At the weekend No Ten declared war on the BBC, saying that timersquos up for the licence fee.ldquoWersquore going to whack them, said a Government source, quoted in The Sunday Times. Probably been watching too many episodes of The Sopranos.The future is subscription. People wonrsquot pay a video poll tax in the age of Netflix, wersquore told. The BBC should sink or swim in the market ndash probably the former. First casualties will be local and ldquoregionalldquo servicesWersquore assured that this has nothing whatever to do with Andrew Neilrsquos lecture on the PMrsquos integrity when he refused to appear on his show during the General Election campaignNow, itrsquos not yet clear that the Government will get away with this. Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes. Remember Royal Bank of Scotland saying that it would up sticks after independence Well, without a trace of irony, or self-awareness, RBS has just renamed itself the National Westminster Bank, in recognition of the fact that  per cent of its business is in the South.Another pillar of the Scottish financial sector, Standard Le, also threatened to leave Scotlandthere was a Yes vote in . It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening. Scotland will be allowed to administer these s, but standards will be set by the UK the better to facilitate trade deals with countries like America. Similarly, Michael Goversquos promise that Scotland would get powers over immigration after Brexit look ridiculous now.Itrsquos enough to make you want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon keeps saying that Indyref will happen later this year. But that is a heroic case of hope triumphing over experience, or reality itself.The joke is on us. There wonrsquot be another legal referendum now that Mr Johnson is home with an -seat majority in Westminster.It feels ashistory itself is trolling Scotland, seeing just how much humiliation Scots are prepared to take.:Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experimentEnglish people werenrsquot so docile and biddable. When Brexiters were confronted with Project Fear, they scoffed and voted regardless for what they regarded as independence from Brussels.Scots were given an offer they couldnrsquot refuse in : a borderless independence within Europe. Unfortunately, we did refuse it. And wersquore stuck with it.And herersquos the kicker.

While it is not possible to meet every partyrsquos demands in full, I believe in reaching formal agreement with the Green Party, I am also delivering on key asks from every party and I encourage all MSPs to consider giving their support to Scotlandrsquos budget.ldquoThis budget invests a record pound billion in health and care services, delivers Scotlandrsquos unique child payment to lt our youngest out of poverty, transfers pound billion of social security spending, supports our efforts to tackle the climate crisis and the creation of a Scottish National Investment Bank.ldquoThe Scottish Government had already backed Police Scotland with a budget increase of pound million. We will now increase that support to pound million overall with pound million of investment for frontline services.ldquoAnd we will deliver in full the support Cosla and others have asked for with pound million for local government.ldquoWe have made signicant investments to tackle the climate crisis, with funding for a green deal, low carbon travel and pound.bn of low carbon infrastructure.ldquoI will also increase funding for walking, cycling and safer streets to pound million for the first time and boost support for energy efficiency measures as part of our focus on reaching net-zero.\"When I presented the budget I said that every penny had been spent and that remains the case. In the absence of proposals to change spending, this additional investment will be funded through limited amounts of underspend, taking a multi-year approach to issues around non-domestic rates without impacting on local authority revenues, and additional consequentials from the fossil fuel levy.\"While this increases the financial exposure of the government it ensures that social security payments can be made and public services properly funded.In a tweet, Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said: ldquoThe Scottish Green MSPs always work hard to achieve positive change, and in recent weeks weve been working for a budget deal which responds to the #ClimateEmergency and protects local services.Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said: ldquoFree bus travel for young people is a transformational step towards tackling the climate emergency. This scheme will benefit young people starting college and families, some of whom stand to save thousands of pounds a year, and encourage whole generations of public transport users.ldquoBuses are the backbone of local public transport and the key to employment and training opportunities for so many of those starting out in le.ldquoYet again itrsquos the Scottish Greens who have engaged constructively in the budget process to deliver for communities in Scotland. Clearly, a Green budget would do even more to tackle the climate emergency, but securing this important free bus travel deal for the next generation builds on the powers we won for local councils to take control of local bus services. It is the Scottish Greens who are leading the change.ldquoAnd as we have done in every year we have struck a deal, the Greens have prioritised funding for local government, securing an additional poundm for libraries, schools and other local services.The Scottish Tories called the budget deal ldquoshambolic, and mocked the Greens for dropping their early demand to cancel new road projects.The Tories also queried the credibility of the concessionary bus scheme for young people, noting the Government had only committed to support it subject to further work.Finance spokesperson Donald Cameron said: ldquoWhile some of the measures announced are to be welcomed, this budget still falls well short of what our economy and public services need.ldquoItrsquos no wonder that the SNP has yet again tricked the Greens into supporting the budget, which is now becoming an increasingly laughable and humiliating situation for Patrick Harvie.ldquoTherersquos no commitment to free bus travel for young people, as the Greens seem to naively think, and the Green party seems to have dropped almost every other demand it previously made.ldquoUnless the SNP government commits to no further ergence from UK tax rates and adds an extra pound.m for drug rehabilitation beds, as well as properly resourcing the capital allocation to local authorities, we cannot support this budget.ldquoThe vague suggestion of lsquoreprofilingrsquo business rates will also set alarm bells ringing in Scotlandrsquos business community, and is something the finance secretary will have to provide clarity on.ldquoEveryone knew the pro-independence parties would leap back into bed together when it mattered ndash but the main losers of this shambolic coupling are people who rely on public services and businesses who keep our economy going.Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoIt is deeply disappointing to see the Scottish Green Party yet again sell our local councils, our environment and, indeed, themselves, short yet again.ldquoBy kow-towing to Kate Forbes, the Greens have given the green light to the deep cuts faced by local government and have entirely abandoned their call for an end to further infrastructure construction.ldquoMost galling of all is the Greenrsquos acceptance of a pale imitation of the call, led by Scottish Labour, for free bus travel for under rsquos by supporting the SNPrsquos promise to merely investigate the possibility of free bus travel for those under , meanwhile passenger numbers on public transport are plummeting.ldquoJust last week, the Greensrsquo Ross Greer said they would not support a budget unless it was a lsquoclimate emergency budgetrsquo. If this is a climate emergency budget, then I suggest Mr. Greer and his party reflect on their environmental credentials.ldquoAs ever, it is the young people of Scotland, our local councils and the environment that will pay the price for the Greens  minutes of fame.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoJust like last year and the year before the Greens have capitulated to the SNP Government, conceding their headline demands yet again.ldquoThis budget leaves the police with a shortfall of tens of millions of pounds and the hard-pressed service with real problems.ldquoLocal government capital is cut by poundm from its need. All this is to protect the budget for an independence referendum that no one thinks is actually going to happen this year. Yet the Green Party and the SNP are still putting money aside for it. People will be baffled by those priorities.Gavin Thomson of Friends of the Earth Scotland said: ldquoScotland badly needs a shake-up in our transport system and, from the announcements so far, this budget agreement appears to represent a strong step in the right direction.ldquoExpanding free bus travel to young people, and an increase in funding for walking and cycling is recognition that our priorities on transport must change.ldquoThese positive changes could be easily funded by a halt to motorway expansion, on which we spend billions and only get more congestion and more emissions in .ldquoIn a climate emergency you must stop doing the things that are making it worse.ldquoTransport is our biggest polluter, making up % of Scotlandrsquos climate emissions, so transformative action is desperately needed.ldquoFree bus travel for those aged  and under is a great start to changing this broken transport system. Young people should be able to use public transport as default, instead of needing to buy a car to get around. Many of our essential services are free-at-the-point-of-use and public transport should be no dferent. This needs to be coupled with measures to discourage car use, to reduce congestion, improve bus journey times and reliability, and persuade commuters from cars to speedy, affordable bus travel.David Lonsdale, Director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said: ldquoFirms will breathe a sigh of relief that MSPs are set to pass a Budget in a timely fashion.ldquoWhilst not perfect, there is much within the Budget that retailers can get behind, in particular those aspects which keep down the cost of doing business and cost of living, during what remains a challenging time for the retail industry in Scotland.ldquoThe below-inflation uplt in the poundage rate, the lting of the threshold for the large business rates supplement, and the protection of ordinary taxpayers from rises in income tax rates, are very welcome and its encouraging that none of these measures have been diluted as a result of the accord with the Green Party."},{"url":null,"title":"steel-going-isnt-scottish-leader-joining","story":"Professor Jay is now doing similarly sterling work as the Chair of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse , whose latest report, on Westminster, was published this week.

He had asked to see Smith following the publication of allegations about the MP in Private Eye.As the IICSA report said: ldquoIt is clear that Lord Steel assumed from what Cyril Smith told him that he had committed the offences reported in Private Eye yet he did nothing about it.He did nothing because the offences took place before Smith joined the Liberal Party and became an MP. They were therefore, felt the then party leader, nothing to do with him.But the IICSA report was devastatingly clear on this point: ldquoThis failure to recognise the risk that Cyril Smith potentially posed to children was an abdication of responsibility by a political leader and an example of a highly placed politician turning a blind eye to something that was potentially troublesome to his party, with no apparent regard for criminal acts which might have occurred or for any victims, past or future.Lord Steel, who later recommended Smith for a knighthood, now says he had trouble hearing the questions at the inquiry and denies that Smith told him the Private Eye story was true. Yet as the inquiry said, he could have corrected his evidence at any point but did not.It was after he gave evidence that Lord Steel was suspended by the Scottish Lib Dems and a party investigation began.A short time later, without waiting for IICSA to report, the party lted the suspension and welcomed Lord Steel back into the fold.: Steel has whip restoredGiven the damning conclusions of the IICSA report, one has to wonder how rigorous this party investigation was. What evidence,any, was taken from others about what Lord Steel knew or did not know when Smith was alive When the suspension was lted, Willie Rennie, the Scottish Party leader, said Lord Steel had claried his initial IICSA evidence and as a result the party found no grounds for action. Why did Lord Steel not offer that same clarication to IICSA itself  What was the clarication Mr Rennie said on Tuesday that it was ldquoright that Lord Steel had resigned and would retire from the Lords. If this was an acceptance by Mr Rennie that the IICSA report was correct, then it is also, by implication, an admission that his partyrsquos inquiry got it wrong.In which case one wonders why Mr Rennie, who bears ultimate responsibility for the party investigation, is still in his job.The Lib Dems would clearly like everyone to accept that with Lord Steel gone from the party and the Lords there is nothing left to see here, and that we should all move on.But that is not good enough. The party needs to explain in detail why its investigation came to the conclusion it did.If it does not, then the public would be justied in thinking that Lord Steel had his suspension lted for no better reason than a General Election was widely held to be in the offing, and the party wanted to put a lid on the matter.The Lib Dems are never slow to accuse other parties of hypocrisythey think the occasion demands it. They are accustomed, by dint of their size and distance from power, to not being subject to as much scrutiny as larger parties.But now it is their turn to answer some dficult questions and they should do so without delay.The best way to start putting matters right would be to reopen the party investigation, and at the same time review internal inquiry procedures. Otherwise, what chance do future inquiries have of coming to the right conclusions Judging by his statements this week, Lord Steel feels himself hard done by, ill served after more than half a century in public le. He should instead be directing all of his sympathy towards the victims of Smith, none of whom will ever receive the justice they deserve."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-scots-living-unsellable-homes-post-grenfell","story":"THOUSANDS of Scots are living in properties they cannot sell as a result of post-Grenfell cladding issues.MSPs heard apartment blocks in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee are among those affected by ldquozero valuations, with particular hotspots around harbourside developments.It comes after mortgage lenders adopted new safety standards in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire in , which caused  deaths.In recent months it has emerged some flats are now being given a ldquozero survey valuation due to the materials used in their construction.Keith Denholm, director at Allied Surveyors, said thousands of properties will be affected across Scotland.He added: ldquoBut the bottom line is, we do not know until such time as an inspection of a building has been undertaken.Properties affected are often blocks built in the s onwards, but Mr Denholm insisted: ldquoWe donrsquot know the extent of the problem.He was giving evidence to Holyroodrsquos Local Government and Communities Committee, which is probing the issue.Mr Denholm said homeowners are being left ldquoabsolutely in limbo and ldquohigh and dry.He said a remediation fund has been set up to help some of those affected in England and Wales, and called for similar measures in Scotland.Brian Smith, a partner at Simpson  Marwick solicitors, said the problem is still ldquorelatively new and first emerged in September.But he warned it could begin to have a real impact on Scotlandrsquos property market.He told MSPs: ldquoScotland was kind of affected first, because the home report is carried out pre-marketing of a property, unlike south of the Border.ldquoSo it became more apparent, but that time of year the market starts to drop off anyway.ldquoEstate agents will generally be telling clients to wait till the start of the new year before they bring the property to market.ldquoSo really, wersquore two months into the new year and I think this is where wersquore going to start to see all these issues coming round.ldquoAnd the problem is the zero value for mortgage purposes clearly is a problem ndash but the biggest problem any market has is uncertainty.ldquoBuyers in particular donrsquot like uncertainty, so itrsquos not just around whether they can get their funding ndash even cash buyers looking at a property that may have a cladding issue, the advice to them is not going to be to buy it without knowing very clearly what that problem is, and what the potential liabilities for remediation will be.ldquoSo until wersquore in a point where there has been some comprehensive evaluation of the extent of the problem, and some understanding of what the remediation path is going to be, I think the market is going to continue to be affected by these uncertainties and have dficulties.Elsewhere, chartered building surveyor Phil Diamond said it was ldquocrazy that combustible materials are still being used in Scotland.Scottish Tory housing spokesman Graham Simpson said: ldquoIt is astonishing that we do not yet have an immediate ban on combustible material in cladding, as in the rest of the UK ndash the SNP government must introduce this as a matter of the utmost urgency.ldquoIt is not right that properties are being built here to a lesser standard of fire safety than in England Wales, and then owners canrsquot get mortgages. Itrsquos a crazy situation. With regards to the issues preventing mortgage valuations on property with substandard cladding, the Scottish Government must immediately convene a working group of key stakeholders to solve this problem in Scotland.ldquoThey should also work with the UK government to ensure Scots homeowners arenrsquot being penalised for the increased protection in the rest of the UK.ldquoThe Scottish government must consider setting up a remediation fund to help people who now face potentially ruinous bills and keep people safe.But housing minister Kevin Stewart said it is ldquosimply not true to claim Scotland has set lower standards than the rest of the UK.He added: ldquoScotland set higher standards for external wall cladding systems last year, with the trigger height for non-combustible cladding reducing from m to m in all new high rise domestic and non-domestic buildings. We have also set a higher standard for cladding systems on assembly buildings, entertainment buildings, hospitals and residential care buildings of any height, with the exception of small buildings.ldquoMortgage lenders - who are independent bodies - introduced a new requirement concerning cladding and oversight, which we remain very concerned about.ldquoWe understand the anxiety that homeowners will be experiencing due to this issue , which is why we have repeatedly urged the UK Government to resolve it urgently as regulation of the mortgage industry, alongside insurance issues, is a matter reserved to the UK Government."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-pupils-no-longer-best-uk-reading-comprehension","story":"The largest literacy study ever conducted in the UK, written by Professor Keith Topping from the University of Dundee, has revealed that Scottish pupils are now joint second in terms of their level of reading comprehension ndash on a par with England and behind Northern Ireland.The What Kids Are Reading Report analysed the reading habits of , Scottish pupils, as well as a further . million young people across the UK and Ireland.The study analysed the dficult of the books children were reading and the level of pupilsrsquo comprehension.

To explain this, Mr Mackay delves into the psychology of the Scottish voter, citing a recent switch from performance judgment to a sense of identity, or the need to \"belong\", which the SNP is providing with its unequivocal stance on matters such as Brexit, the EU and, of course, independence. I think this, while perhaps true within itself, misses the dominant factor, which is that no one  is perceived as capable of providing either good government or a clear identity.Politically speaking, Scotland is a de facto one-party state since there is no effective opposition the SNP has the votes, and has even boosted its share, giving votes to prisoners and foreigners, reckoning that in gratitude they would favour those who provided them. In this, the SNP was backed by the Greens, who would support anything in exchange for \"green\" measures, and the LibDems, who probably supported the move as a matter of party doctrine. The Labour Party also backed it despite it being against their best interests. Why is beyond me.Ms Sturgeon, I think, is caught between the proverbial rock and hard place, the hard place being the intransigent refusal of London to even consider Indyref, and the rock being the uncompromising demands her own base of hard liners, who seem impervious to reason. On independence, Mr Mackay says: ldquoShersquos teased the base with independence for years in order to keep power. Now her more headstrong and ill-considered colleagues want to get on with it, come what may. A grubby political assassination of Sturgeon would be the beginning of the end for the SNP. Not necessarily. Without Ruth Davidson at the helm, the Tories will be lucky to hold on to their current share, so until Labour provides a viable opposition, psychological analysis of voting patterns is interesting, but somewhat moot. The SNP has it in the bag for now, and will continue to do so unless Labour starts to put up a fight.Jim Robertson, East Kilbride.NEIL Mackay is quick to point out the many supposed failings of the SNP while in government. His main beef appears to be that the SNP should stop its \"obsession\" with independence and concentrate on health, education and the like He states this as though independence is simply some arcane side issue. The reality of course is that its only with independence that Scotland will have access to all the economic and constitutional levers that will enable the changes that Mr Mackay hankers after. He also singularly fails to provide any clues as to what measures he thinks should be taken to redress the \"woeful\" record of the SNP. For instance, which titans in other political parties does he envisage righting all of Scotlands supposed wrongs Philip Maughan, Portree.NEIL Mackay in his brilliant article does not hold back in his exposeacute of the SNP: ldquo...hardcore independence supporters will cut the SNP any amount of slack when it comes to scandals and mismanagement because itrsquos the only vehicle to get them what they want.It is understandable that the SNP ldquoman in the street in his quest for some sort of misguided emotional freedom would disregard any ldquoscandal and mismanagement of his party to achieve what he wants, despite huge economic and financial catastrophe. And we read about SNP mismanagement on a weekly basis, failing our children, failing our old people, failing the poor, failing our economy and much, much .How is it then that SNP MPs and MSPs, apparently sensible, responsible representatives of ldquothe people of Scotland are prepared to accept and perpetuate these ldquoscandals and mismanagement when they know the ldquopeople of Scotland are being damaged so badly  This is a question for all those who are wavering about their voting intentions should there be another referendum.

However, he learned to embrace his uniqueness and went on a journey that saw him study in the USA, become Scotlandrsquos youngest internationalist, captain Glasgow Rocks and play at the Commonwealth Games and Olympics.ldquoI donrsquot think I suffered from depression, however, I went through a dficult transition as my career neared its end, Achara said of his retirement from basketball.ldquoFor the first time in my le I felt I couldnrsquot control things I was playing poorly, the team was playing poorly then I started becoming obsessed by a few trolls on Twitter, who were consistently criticising my performance.ldquoI ended up playing to trying to please them. I would judge my performance by what two or three people were writing about on Twitter. I then took the decision to quit one Christmas and it was like a weight off my shoulders.ldquoHowever, when the time came, it was real shock when I saw my name had suddenly been removed from the basketball team group chat. That was so final ndash I was no longer Kieron Achara basketball player with team-mates, manager and physios. I was Kieron from Paisley , looking for a job with a baby on the way.Achara believes the key to good mental health is purpose in le, something he has found through his two children and a rekindled interest in sport. He began training again before making the commitment to run his hometown marathon of Stirling, in a frame that was perfectly designed for basketball, but faces challenges in navigating .miles, albeit through some of the countryrsquos most scenic countryside.ldquoRunning helps me feel good, mentally and physically. Itrsquos accessible, you donrsquot need a gym membership and is satisfying seeing your progress.In December, Achara was appointed sports development executive of Frog Systems, a specialist digital firm that promotes mental health and wellbeing and is building relationships with UK sporting bodies to use physical activity as a key improvement tool.ldquoWhen we think of sport, we focus on the physical fitness benefits that regular exercise brings, often overlooking the positive effects on our mental health, he said.ldquoThe camaraderie, the sense of purpose, the feeling of worth, simply getting out of the house and socialising. Itrsquos an important enabler for general wellbeing.The Stirling Marathon is the highlight of a two-day festival of running on October  and  including half marathon, k and family fun run.

Similarly, some children are also cycling without a helmet and I would urge parents to ensure their children are suitably equipped to go out cycling safely.”Committee vice-chair Councillor Rosemary Bruce added: “Aberdeenshire schools are great supporters of the Bikeability scheme which provides training and advice for both the pupils and their families.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Department of Health has said it believes the risk of catching coronavirus from someone with no symptoms at all is low.But because many people with Covid- experience only mild symptoms, particularly during the early stages of the disease, it is possible to catch it from someone who has mild symptoms.ndash Are some groups more at risk The UK Government says that based on current evidence most cases appear to be mild and that those who have died in Wuhan appeared to have pre-existing health conditions.The World Health Organisation has said that about four in five people who contract the virus get mild symptoms and recover.But it added that older people or patients with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes are more at risk of developing serious illness.copy -.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow. The route had been changed because of severe weather over the previous week, making for a course that was very heavy underfoot and flooded in several places.Todd managed to get to the front of the queue at the line and set off at a steady pace, settling in to a position within the top  or so runners after the initial surge.Over the next  minutes she maintained her form and starting easing her way up through the field to settle in sixth place as the runner approached the final quarter of the race.As the finish was coming into sight, Todd started to kick for home and her efforts were rewarded as she moved up to fourth and battled all the way to the finish line to maintain that position, getting it on the line with no more than a foot’sfrom the athlete in fth place.Coach David Wagstaff said it was a fantastic achievement for the youngster, who was not only a great prospect for the future in athletics but also an aspiring triathlete who was doing well on the junior circuit.Todd and her parents thanked NorthLink Ferries, without whose generous sponsorship participation in the cross country championships would not have been possible..."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lewis-insulation-stairs-1-web.jpg","title":"lewis couple made to feel like complete idiots over botched insulation","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineJulie Child and her we Rachel live in North Shawbost on Lewis where they also run a small café. In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH2102NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week service users at Tigh na Drochaid Resource Centre in Portree produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

I am delighted that council’s Inclusive Cycle scheme will now be available to more people with mobility needs in each of our three main towns.“In only a short time since it was launched as a pilot project, this initiative has proven very popular with people of all ages, who have been able to get out and take some exercise along designated cycle routes.“The purchase of the new cycle storage facilities has been made possible thanks to the funding awarded by the Department for Communities, and I congratulate the council officers involved with this wonderful project.”NI actress Helena Bereen makes London stage bow in her s in play that speaks ‘beyond the grave’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"ni actress helena bereen makes london stage bow in her 70s in play that speaks beyond the grave","story":"A Cullybackey actress in her s has made her London stage debut in a play written by an NI man who is posthumously raising money to combat suicide.Derrymacash playwright Joseph Crilly took his own le in a hotel in France in . More than two years on, a play he wrote based on the Good Friday Agreement has premiered in London, raising money for CALM – the Campaign Against Living Miserably – and getting rave reviews.The play ‘On McQuillian’s Hill’ features Helena Bereen, known for her roles in films ‘Hunger’ and ‘The Devil’s Doorway’, and as a stalwart of Belfast’s theatre scene. In spite of a long and busy career, the opportunity to work in London never presented itself ... until now.Set in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, the play written in  centres around IRA man Fra Maline. With peace on a kne-edge, bitter memories, family secrets and lies long buried in the bog threaten to resurface as an accidental family reunion descends into pitch black farce. Mrs Tymelly, played by Bereen who first had the role in the Lyric in , isof everyone’s secrets as well as one of her own.The actress is no stranger to London, but much has changed since she first travelled there: “I worked in London in the s as a nurse – I did midwery in Beckenham Maternity Hospital, a good bit south of the centre. Those were dferent times, and that was a very dferent experience.”Playwright Crilly was an acclaimed writer and actor, who had long since given up penning plays and treading the boards. Exchanging full houses for social housing, at the time of his death he was working at Peabody Housing Trust, where few of his colleagues knew he had been involved in the theatre at all, let alone that he was an award-winning playwright, and had worked as an actor at the highest level, including time with the Royal Shakespeare Company and a litany of television appearances.Doreen Productions formed for the sole purpose of introducing Crilly’s work to a new audience. ‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ opened at the Finborough Theatre, directed by Belfast’s Jonathan Harden. Mr Harden said: “There’s a real possibility that the play could have been lost. The sad reality is that had Joe survived, this production would never have happened. We are here, in so many ways, because like  others in the UK every day, a man took his own le.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!.

Until we accept there is a problem, there is never going to be a solution.”Oldpark SDLP councillor and the party’s homelessness spokesperson, Paul McCusker, described the figures as “worrying”.“According to figures from the Housing Executive, there is a chronic need for more social housing in North Belfast,” he added.“While housing should absolutely be allocated based on objective need, it is clear that stark disparities exist in predominantly nationalist areas, like the ones I represent in Ardoyne and Carrick Hill.“The area known as North Belfast One showed an average need of , houses in  , a steady increase since   when  homes were required. Just % of the  housing allocations in North Belfast in   were in NB while % were in NB, despite the dfering levels of requirement for social housing between both areas.“These figures are worrying but unfortunately are not surprising to many of us in North Belfast, who have been aware for some time of the dficulties. Behind these figures are families who have been waiting, many for years and in inadequate conditions, to get a house and build a home. They should not have to wait any longer.“I welcome the frank statement from Minister Hargey, who shares my concern at the inequalities highlighted. I hope she will make it a priority to redress this stark imbalance.”A spokesperson for the Housing Executive said:“We will be reviewing current record-keeping practice in light of the Minister’s comments and officials will engage with the DfC about this issue.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day.

She presents Join Her at Northern Vision’s NvTv.Lori is not a household name in Northern Ireland’s TV industry but I can bet you my last shilling she is daring and it will not be long before we see a sea of work from hershe decides to work in this media sector. Imagine not having your typical chest thumping, mean drama kings and queens we are used to on our television sets.I would say she is arguably one of the most influential voices in the Black and Minority Ethnic community in all Ireland. Her fair and balanced approach is something rare these days, always well researched, the audience feels assured that this is not just a regular motivational speaker but someone who loves her job and wishes one thing: that changing one is changing many. Of course, not everyone will agree with the person on the podium. The human mind doesn’t work like that. It would be very odd and annoyingeveryone agreed with you. But those who have perfected their art in using the power of speech to change society know only too well that the more critics you attract, the better.Lori loves sports, especially basketball, which she played at professional level and she enjoys swimming whenever she gets time for it. Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in .

In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments.

The declining performance of the health service has been blamed in part on the staffing crisis.Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursingin Northern Ireland, last night said the figures demonstrate why nurses felt it necessary to strike in December and January.The latest nursing vacancies for December of last year come as no surprise to nurses in Northern Ireland, she said.Over the past year nursing has consistently had the highest level of vacancies among all staff groups working in health and social care services.According to the figures, the vacancy rate in nursing posts had fallen slightly in December - down from , in June  to , at the end of the year.However, the number of empty nursing support posts has more than doubled between March  and December last year, from  to .Ms Cullen said she was concerned by this and said the figures reinforce the need for the Health Minister to act urgently to address shortages across the nursing profession.The figures have also highlighted startling shortages in other NHS services.There were  empty social worker posts at the end of last year, compared to  in March , while health bosses were trying to fill  domiciliary care worker posts in December. At the same time, the figures show health bosses were trying to recruit  allied health professionals - up from  in March .A spokesman from the Department of Health said it is taking a range of actions to reduce vacancies, both in the short term, for example, international nursing recruitment, and in the longer term, including implementation of the Workforce Strategy which was published in May , increased training commissioning, and efforts to ensure that HSC is an employer of choice.It is clear, however, that there are no quick fixes, and sustainable, multi-year funding is required, together with service transformation.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadNorthern Ireland grammar school pupils suspended for #repulsive# video mocking people with Down#s syndromeVideo: Car slams through hedge landing in garden of Co Antrim homeThousands in Northern Ireland lose benefits in transition to PIP system DUP#s Donaldson to chair Westminster briefing with minister who branded LGBT education #state-sponsored abuse#Co Tyrone man Paul Campbell jailed for  bomb attack on RUC station,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Picture: BBC  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp-year-old Dan Douglas from Banbridge. Picture: BBC February   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Public Health Agencyhas apologised to a Northern Ireland family after they were advised to isolate themselves in their home after their son ed from an Italian ski trip. Dan Douglas , from Banbridge, Do Down, was told to self-isolate in his bedroom for  days after experiencing a cold after a visit to San Valentino in northern Italy. He had not been to any of the  towns at the epicentre of the outbreak in the country but was given incorrect advice after his mother Elaine made two separate phone calls to the PHA helpline. It comes after the PHA revealed there have been in the region of  calls to the helpline over the past two weeks. The agency said they have no record of which helpline operator - who are not medically trained - gave the advice but said they have now put new measures in place to strengthen the service being offered. It#s after Elaine Douglas called the helpline this week when she was told by Dan#s school to contact their GP after he displayed symptoms of a cold. Dan#s father Dougie Douglas said: The helpline said get him out of school, get him home and put him in isolation and phone us back when you#ve done that.Mrs Douglas said the helpline advised her to undertake measures including: Keeping her -year-old son in his room while the rest of the family were asked to isolate themselves in their house Serve Dan his food on paper plates with plastic cutlery to be disposed of in a strong plastic bin bagNot to take anything out of his room for a period of two weeks Make sure Dan only used one bathroom, not to be used by the rest of the family Dan should clean his room with antiseptic spray every couple of hours To clean every handle he uses Speaking while her son was in isolation, Mrs Douglas said: I phoned back the helpline this morning to say he doesn#t have the symptoms they#ve listed on the website. Because he had a headcold, they said he has to [stay in isolation]. She said it would get a lot worse very quickly Dougie DouglasI assumed somebody would come out and test him but the helpline said just to monitor his condition andit gets worse call . She said it would get a lot worse very quickly.Mrs Douglas said she asked for her details to be passed on to a surveillance team but hadn#t heard anything from any public health body. She said she feared the public stigma around the virus. We live in a development and there are lots of neighbours and we don#t want people to say that#s the house that has coronavirus.Teenager Dan said he was bored in his room but that he understood the measures that were being taken. It#s for the safety of everyone  around me. People in school are making these  rumours about me being in hospital and that and it#s sort of worrying when I go to school, that people are going to look at me in a dferent way.When we landed in Dublin we didn#t get checked or anything, just got on the bus and went home Dan DouglasSpeaking of his experience in Italy, he said: When we landed, the towns around where we were staying were put in lockdown, which made everyone worried and wary of the people around them. You saw how many people were wearing a mask.When we landed in Dublin we didn#t get checked or anything, just got on the bus and went home.But when he went back to school, he had a runny nose so went to the nurse to get medication. I went to the nurse to get paracetamol and she told me to make sure I binned the tissue when I sneezed and cleaned my hands.I went home and did my homework that night and then out of nowhere I got taken away.On Wednesday, after Dan had spent two days in isolation, the Douglas family received a call from Dr Philip Veal of the PHA who told them they had been given the wrong information. Mrs Douglas said: I#m relieved we can have our le back and we#re not going to have to spend two weeks in the house. I was more concerned that my son as going to be in a shoebox of a bedroom with all his food rubbish and waste in a black bag for two weeks.Mr Douglas added it was a real relief that the information around the coronavirus had been claried. I didn#t really know what to do and I didn#t feel the information we were given was enough. They didn#t even ask for our address, even for somebody to speak to my son.Mrs Douglas said she would advise anyone with any doubts to phone the PHA directly and not to use the helpline. Dr Philip Veal of the PHA said he was surprised to hear the family had been given incorrect advice and that the agency was keen to send the right message to the public. We very much regret and apologise to the family for the inconvenience and discomfort this has caused them, he said. At the moment what we#re doing is asking people have they travelled to an area where there has been a spread of coronavirus andthey have associated symptoms like a cold or shortness of breath to make contact with their GP.Dr Veal said the PHA has taken steps to bring the situation under control following this incident. We#ve improved our quality assurance measures around the advice given, for example regular reviewing of the scripting given to the helpline, twice daily contact with the call line handlers to give them support and a direct line of contact with us should they need further advice. The coronavirus is a fast moving situation and new areas of concern are constantly evolving. We#re constantly working to update and sometimes when the information goes out there can be a lag, he said. Two wrong bits of advice is two too many so we#ve taken very robust steps to improve the quality of our helpline.Belfast Related ContentNorthern IrelandCo Antrim man living in Shanghai insists #le just goes on# despite coronavirus lockdown A Co Antrim man living in Shanghai has said that le hasn#t ground to a halt despite living under tight lockdown as China battles the spread of the deadly coronavirus.Northern IrelandGoods made in China are running low in Northern Ireland shops due to coronavirus Supplies of Chinese-made consumer goods, such as curtains and sofas, are expected to run low in shops here due to factory shutdowns triggered by coronavirus. ata media briefing on preparedness in Northern Ireland to respond to Coronavirus at the Department of Health in Stormont on Wednesday Pic Colm Lenaghan Pacemaker \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming a .ece AUTOCROP wh ing%N%Ireland%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming a .ece AUTOCROP wh ing%N%Ireland%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming a .ece AUTOCROP wh ing%N%Ireland%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming a .ece AUTOCROP wh ing%N%Ireland%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming a .ece AUTOCROP wh ing%N%Ireland%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   ata media briefing on preparedness in Northern Ireland to respond to Coronavirus at the Department of Health in Stormont on Wednesday Pic Colm Lenaghan Pacemaker \"GalleryNorthern IrelandCoronavirus: Isolation ward on standby in Northern Ireland but no cases after  tested, say health officialsAn isolation ward is on standby at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast should there be a confirmed coronavirus case in Northern Ireland, health officials have said.GalleryNorthern IrelandCoronavirus fears: Northern Ireland schools send home pupils ing from ski trips in ItalyPupils at schools in Northern Ireland ing from half-term ski trips in northern Italy have been sent home over fears about the coronavirus.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddef-ffd-d-cd-dacee_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddef-ffd-d-cd-dacee_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddef-ffd-d-cd-dacee_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddef-ffd-d-cd-dacee_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddef-ffd-d-cd-dacee_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"World, recorded deaths in more than , confirmed cases of Covid-The total number of people infected worldwide by coronavirus has now risen above ,, with , recorded deaths.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk defc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebc-c--bb-aacce_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk defc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebc-c--bb-aacce_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk defc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebc-c--bb-aacce_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk defc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebc-c--bb-aacce_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk defc .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebc-c--bb-aacce_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKTV doctor blasts quarantine measures at coronavirus-hit Tenere hotelTV doctor Hilary Jones has blasted quarantine measures at a coronavirus-hit Tenere hotel as the Foreign Office said it was keeping the situation under review.VideoVideo NewsBoris Johnson - NHS prepared to deal with coronavirus,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadNorthern Ireland grammar school pupils suspended for #repulsive# video mocking people with Down#s syndromeVideo: Car slams through hedge landing in garden of Co Antrim homeThousands in Northern Ireland lose benefits in transition to PIP system DUP#s Donaldson to chair Westminster briefing with minister who branded LGBT education #state-sponsored abuse#Co Tyrone man Paul Campbell jailed for  bomb attack on RUC station,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But we#ve only had about two or three. The volume has dropped drastically because factories in China aren#t back to full production, and that will definitely have an impact on the supply chain. Normally we#d be taking full loads of things like curtains or sofas from China for shops in Northern Ireland but they haven#t come.He said a delivery expected on February  would now be delayed until March . Chinese factories shut down as part of an effort to contain the virus and those in regions less badly hit by the virus are ing to production.Mr Burns said he has worked in shipping for  years but that the coronavirus had had the worst impact of any public health crisis. I remember SARS back in  and it wasn#t as bad as this, he said.Northern Ireland exported just under £m in goods to China during , the most recent year for which figures are available. Machinery and transport equipment made up around one third of yearly sales. Around £m in food and animal products were also sent in .Mark O#Connell, the chief executive of global trade advisers OCO Global, said the crisis will lead companies to reduce their reliance on China for supplies. They might switch to more domestic suppliers but not everyone has capacity to do that, he said. But there#s no doubt people will look to simply their supply chains to reduce their dependency on China.And he said exports of food to China would face delays getting into the country#s ports. In the case of beef or pork, that will be frozen, so as long as they keep the refrigeration going, another week at sea won#t destroy it, he said.But he said insurance was unlikely to pay out for consignments which were spoiled or where orders were cancelled, as a public health crisis is likely to be classed as a force majeure.And he said companies in Northern Ireland were also likely to take a hit from the spread of the virus in Italy.Italy is an important supplier in composites and aircraft, and to anybody in aerospace or advanced manufacturing, he said.

Gerry says the tour is an ideal sounding board for new material.“The best way to try these out is to practise it, try it live andthey go down well, then you know it’s a goer.“It’s hard to get everyone together with everyone’s busy schedule but we’re looking into a few older Clancy Brothers songs while trying to keep a modern twist.“And also,we try to start writing stuff again, that would be good too.”For now, the focus is on this weekend’s gig in An Carn, but anyone misty-eyed for the raucous nights at the Hatfield may have to curb their enthusiasm.“For theatre gigs, everything has to be the finished product,” says Gerry.“You can’t be going on singing too many rowdy Pogues songs – but we love being able to do both settings.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ulster Universityhas also confirmed that steps are being mapped out before any decision is made on the relocation of health science courses. Figures obtained by the Derry News by way of a Freedom of Informationrequest, after UU refused to provide them, show that student numbers have dropped from , in   to , in   - that is both full-time and part-time students. At Coleraine, numbers have dropped from , in   to , this year. It means that since   student numbers at Magee have decreased by . googletag.cmd.push The proposed graduate entry medical schoolat the Derry campus is projected to have  students in  enrolments begin next year as envisaged. Derry representatives have insisted that Health Science courses, such as physiotherapy and radiotherapy, from Jordanstown be transferred to the city to complement the GEMS. Those courses would attract approximately , students over time and are viewed as pivotal in the push towards the desired , students. However, all options remain on the table and the courses could end up in Coleraine or the new Belfast campus. An Ulster University spokesperson said: “The University has gathered feedback from a range of stakeholders on the future location of its health sciences courses. googletag.cmd.push “The next steps in the process to reach a fully informed final decision will be confirmed shortly.” Last week the Department for the Economy said “no funding” has, as yet, been formally committed by the UK or Irish Governments towards increasing undergraduate places at the Magee Campus as outlined in New Decade, New Approach. At the end of January, DfE announced that it was committed to delivering expansion of the Belfast campus and would provide UU with a poundm bailout to complete the build. The NI Audit Office had previously said the final cost was expected to be poundm over budget. At the same meeting, senior DfE officials declared that UU’s business case for Magee expansion was out of date and “new money” was needed – an outcome the official said was “hard to see happening.” A spokesperson for the Derry University Group commented: “This is a point of crisis. Commitments given to the North West in the Stormont Programme for Governmenthave clearly been broken by Belfast. “The political will shown by the two governments in New Decade, New Approach, has not been reciprocated by the new administration here. “This will have seriously damaging effects on the North West’s already-broken Higher Education sector and a devastating impact on the region’s faltering economy.” He continued: “The generosity shown by the North West’s main political parties in re-establishing partnerships under New Decade, New Approach has been abused, very cynically – as has Council’s relationship with Ulster University. “The two governments, and our local public representatives, cannot afford to wait any longer while the Greater Belfast Lobby bankrupts another administration. They must act immediately in the interests of the North West by overturning off-the-books bailout of UU and Belfast, and by insisting on the full implementation of the original PfG.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ulster Universityhas also confirmed that steps are being mapped out before any decision is made on the relocation of health science courses. Figures obtained by the Derry News by way of a Freedom of Informationrequest, after UU refused to provide them, show that student numbers have dropped from , in   to , in   - that is both full-time and part-time students. At Coleraine, numbers have dropped from , in   to , this year. It means that since   student numbers at Magee have decreased by . googletag.cmd.push The proposed graduate entry medical schoolat the Derry campus is projected to have  students in  enrolments begin next year as envisaged. Derry representatives have insisted that Health Science courses, such as physiotherapy and radiotherapy, from Jordanstown be transferred to the city to complement the GEMS. Those courses would attract approximately , students over time and are viewed as pivotal in the push towards the desired , students. However, all options remain on the table and the courses could end up in Coleraine or the new Belfast campus. An Ulster University spokesperson said: “The University has gathered feedback from a range of stakeholders on the future location of its health sciences courses. googletag.cmd.push “The next steps in the process to reach a fully informed final decision will be confirmed shortly.” Last week the Department for the Economy said “no funding” has, as yet, been formally committed by the UK or Irish Governments towards increasing undergraduate places at the Magee Campus as outlined in New Decade, New Approach. At the end of January, DfE announced that it was committed to delivering expansion of the Belfast campus and would provide UU with a poundm bailout to complete the build. The NI Audit Office had previously said the final cost was expected to be poundm over budget. At the same meeting, senior DfE officials declared that UU’s business case for Magee expansion was out of date and “new money” was needed – an outcome the official said was “hard to see happening.” A spokesperson for the Derry University Group commented: “This is a point of crisis. Commitments given to the North West in the Stormont Programme for Governmenthave clearly been broken by Belfast. “The political will shown by the two governments in New Decade, New Approach, has not been reciprocated by the new administration here. “This will have seriously damaging effects on the North West’s already-broken Higher Education sector and a devastating impact on the region’s faltering economy.” He continued: “The generosity shown by the North West’s main political parties in re-establishing partnerships under New Decade, New Approach has been abused, very cynically – as has Council’s relationship with Ulster University. “The two governments, and our local public representatives, cannot afford to wait any longer while the Greater Belfast Lobby bankrupts another administration. They must act immediately in the interests of the North West by overturning off-the-books bailout of UU and Belfast, and by insisting on the full implementation of the original PfG.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A row of terraced houses at Wapping Lane, close to the Fountain estate, have lain empty for a considerable number of years. Those properties are amongst , that are sitting empty across the Derry and Strabane council area. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive , says empty properties are a “wasted resource” for the owner and those looking for somewhere to live. “Vacant homes can deteriorate and become a nuisance for people living close by. They may also lead to neighbourhood decline,” NIHE added. googletag.cmd.push Potential benefits of bringing an empty home back into use include generating rental income to offset rates and the costs of maintaining the property, releasing capital from the sale of the property and protecting the long-term investment potential of the property. In addition, it reduces the risk of vandalism, squatting and anti-social behaviour, and liability for health and safety issues, or damage to adjoining properties. When planning permission was granted to convert the iconic former Sinclair factory building on Abercorn Road into  apartments, the proposal also involved the conversion of seven vacant terraced dwellings along Wapping Lane into  apartments. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA for Foyle, Gary Middleton, told the Derry News that it is vitally important to develop this street. “I do want to see this area developed, it is my personal preference that they be kept as houses because I’d like to see more families move in to reinvigorate the area. In conversations I’ve had with the developer they have been positive about the possibility of houses. “I know parking was an issue, but I would encourage the developer to work as quickly as possible as it is in their interest to see them developed also.” The Foyle MLA said that homelessness figures show the need for housing in the city. “You don’t want to see any area sitting in derelictionit can be avoided. “It would also bring development of the streetscape which would complement the work that has already been done on the Abercorn Road – Wapping Lane needs to be part of that. “It would avoid problems with anti-social behaviour and environmental issues which have emerged while the properties have been vacant.” People Before Profit Councillor for the Moor area, Eamonn McCann, said it is “unacceptable” for so many houses to remain unoccupied. He believes that many housing units are being “turned over to Air BB” to take advantage of busy periods in the Derry calendar. It proves a lucrative business for property owners, he said, and means they don’t feel the need to let them out for the rest of the year. Cllr McCann is of the view that Stormont must implement a “crash programme” of house building for the Derry area and NI as a whole. “There is a serious shortage of housing, particularly rental properties for young people.” He suggested giving the Housing Executive powers to build again by using the , properties in its ownership as collateral to borrow money against. Councillor McCann supported development at Wapping Lane, adding: “The need for housing is as great as it was  years ago. Derry was the spark for progressive movements in the past and it must be again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But before you know it little ‘Mary’ is three years old and you only ever see her at Christmas or on her birthday IF you have time and even then she doesn’t really know who you are.Yes you are working, yes you have your own children, yes you live an hour away etc etc BUT what happened to all those good intentions Good intentions are all well and good, butyou don’t actually do anything well they don’t actually mean anything - it’s the old excuses… could have done, would have done, will do, next time, but in fact you HAVEN’T, DIDN’T and DON’T!I love spending time with my nieces, and my great niece too. I’ve one of them to pick up at twelve o’clock today and I KNOW after she goes home I’ll be hoovering up glitter and sequins for weeks!But when I do collect her, see her as she runs to the door shouting ‘Aunty Jen’ and gives me a huge hug and big smile it makes all the glitter and sequins worthwhile, oh and all the laughing and smiling we’ll do together helps as well! It’s fab being an aunty, and I’m sure it is being an uncle and a godparent too, we can spoil them, treat them, play silly games with them - even have a go on the see saw and slide.We can enjoy going to the cinema and watching the new Disney films, visiting the farm or zoo, making popcorn and snuggling on the couch to watch cartoons, getting messy with paint , dancing around the living room and jumping on the couch to get away from the crocodilesand as they get older doing hair and make up, going on go karts or swimming - great excuse to go on that new slide in the swimming baths .There’s loads of fun to be had together so simply put,you don’t have your niece, nephew or godchild for a visit regularly YOU are the one missing out! Of course I’m not suggesting you should have them every week, every Saturday night .But maybe once every month, six weeks or couple of months for a sleep over - they’ll be so excited.I knowyou’ve got children and so has your brother, sister or friend that this may be hard for you, but maybe you could swop children for the day - then you’ll all get a chance to be that fab aunty, uncle or godparent.Or have your children and your niece, nephew or godchild too - what dference is one more child going to make.Yes parents this means you would have a babysitter but you’ve got to do it for your brother, sister or friend too! As I write quite often, their childhoods go by so fast, it’s the time with you today that creates the bond between you both - this does apply to aunts, uncles and godparents too.As our children become teenagers sometimes they need this ‘other’ trusted and loved adult in their le too - someone to talk to when times are tough, someone to be ‘on their side’, someone to help them make the right choice, a place and person of safety when things are going wrong.And this is what you promised when they were just a baby… ‘I’ll always look out for you, be there for you and be there to help you enjoy the world’.But how will they be able to do thisthey don’t know you, don’t play with you, have days out with you, or sleep overs at your house and only see you at Christmas - evenyou do bring great presents Anyway got to run, off to pick up my niece, take her to McDonald’s for lunch, then the cake shop so she can choose a special cake tor us to share after our tea, then it’s home for glueing, glitter, sequins and paint, before playing Snap, dolls and hairdressers, after that it’s be a bath bomb bath for herthen snuggles with stories before bed!No I won’t be telling her Dad about the sweets and ice cream - it’s my job to enjoy, love AND spoil her! googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

Of course attentions will turn thereafter to the retention of the National League and All-Ireland crowns garnered by Galway last year, whatever the result. It’s been busy but when the medals are piling up and you’re two from two in major Finals at Croke Park with another to come, all in the space of a year, complaining isn’t the first instinct. The Camogie success hasn’t protected her from real le - the final year commerce student has an interview for a Masters course next week – but it is a wonderful distraction. googletag.cmd.push Spellman was promoted to the Senior ranks with Galway by Cathal Murray. Though the boss is a clubmate, who was player-manager when Sarsfields last one the Senior Hurling Championship in  – her brother Eoin was involved – her performances atomised any notions of favourable treatment. Besides, Murray made it clear that reputations meant little to him and gave opportunities too to Caitriona Cormican and Catherine Finnerty. “It has been kind of surreal looking back on it” Spellman admits. “To start off in Intermediate and then make the breakthrough to Senior. And then starting in the All-Ireland Final was the pinnacle of my career so far. googletag.cmd.push “You would always dream of making a Senior breakthrough. Starting off the year at Intermediate you would try and build yourself up through the ranks and try and make a name for yourself. But it all happened last summer thank God.” Finnerty went on to excel in the All-Ireland decider following the cruciate knee ligament injury suffered by Tara Kenny  days before. That means Kenny misses out for Sarsfields too but she remains an influential figure in the camp and is targeting ato action in the summer. “Poor Tara Kenny, she is so unfortunate to miss out two times in Croke Park. But she is geeing us on. She is a massive character on our team going back  years. She is one of the leaders. You would look up to her. Her and the likes of Niamh , they are the older ones.” Spellman, who turns  in June, was a newcomer when Slaughtneil got their three-in-a-row run underway against Sarsfields in  . It finished - to - the following season. The experience should help. Certainly last September will. “It will be bringing back some good memories from then alright. I also remember the first Final with the club in  I remember feeling when you ran out onto the field, you were so young. You couldn’t really prepare for it, the feeling of the first time playing in Croke Park. The nerves got to us that day playing Slaughtneil. Hopefully we settle more and get over the right side of the line Sunday.” The  decider took place at St. Tiernach’s Park after the initial fixture fell foul of the weather. “Orlaithgot injured in the warm-up and Niamh pulled her back the week before theFinal. She was in awful pain. She wasn’t able to play but she started and lasted  minutes. She was the fulcrum in midfield. So it is good to have her at full fitness.” McGrath’sto the Galway ranks, along with sisters Orlaith and Siobhaacuten, will certainly boost the Maroons’ shot at history – retaining an All-Ireland title for the first time. “They are massive additions. The skills they have. Orlaith is lethal in the forwards, Niamh with the workrate in midfield. Siobhaacuten is lethal too. When you play against her she is like a snake she goes in through you. She is so small. Every ball into her hand and she is thinking about hitting the net. She is hard to stop. “There will be a lot of competition. It will benefit the team.” That is the type of philosophy that encapsulates Spellman’smodus operandion the pitch. She beavers away, chasing, harrying, challenging, happy to get dirty in the trenches and for others to emerge with the headlines. It is thoroughly Spartan in philosophy and action. “I go back a bit, trying to help. We have a lethal full-forward line to get the ball into. So you’re trying to win the ball and get it in. “It doesn’t matter who gets the scores as long as we win the match. Managers want the best for the team so you do what they ask you and you work hard.” Certainly,it is to be third time lucky against Slaughtneil, they will need to battle like never before. “They have such athleticism and fitness. We were taken aback nearly the first year. They ran us off the ground. Hopefully in the last few years we upped our strength and conditioning with Kevin Ward doing the running. Hopefully we can prove ourselves this year. We have the skills so hopefully it all comes right on the day.” For an extensive preview of Sundays final, grab a copy of this weeks County Derry Post.

You should never, ever accept defeat.“If youre able to show that comebackability youre never dead You saw it last year when we were away to Dundalk and away to Shamrock Rovers when it looked aswe were down and out but we came back. Theres that fighting spirit. “Its also got to do with the people who come off the bench. Its about making positive changes to try and get you back in the game. Its all down to the players and their appetite to not want to lose games. You would think thats a gimme in football but its not and were very proud that here we dont accept defeat and we keep going to the very last seconds of the game.”Despite last weeks game against Harps being televised, the Brandywell was packed to capacity and the supporters who stayed until the very end got their reward of a late goal. On reflection, Devine believes that the new players at the club may have been slightly overawed at their first experience of thousands of City fans cheering them on.“These bunch of players back themselves, they are good players,” he continued. “It was a wee bit of a culture shock for them seeing the crowd and the appetite and the expectation last Friday night but Im definitely sure that they will be ready for it this week. “The players were absolutely devastated that the game at St. Pats was called off because they were all going there confident.” googletag.cmd.push SignicantBoth Dundalk and Shamrock Rovers won on Monday night, maintaining their % starts to the new campaign. Bohs, who finished just ahead of Derry in third place last season, have also had a decent start, winning two from three. A win at the Brandywell would create a signicant gap between the two sides just a few weeks into the season, something which Devine is aware of.“These are the days in the season where we are all finding our way,” he said. “We have to make sure that we improve week by week and we cant wait for the games to come because the games are the biggest teacher. They show us what teams are right, what players are right, what formations are right. “The games will hopefully come thick and fast and hopefully we can start putting points on the board.“I dont think that anyone is ever going to be too concerned in the opening round of matches. Weve had a narrow defeat to Dundalk and weve drawn a Northwest derby so I dont think theres anything overly concerning at this moment in time.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and

I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it.

I started to do some practice tricks with Stella where she would move between and around my legs and she was fantastic.ldquoI loved the thought of going to a dog show with mum for the whole day and meeting lots of other dogs so I started going to class regularly with mum.Ann, Fiona and their dogs, Stella, Minty and Turfy mdash another Bichon Frise mdash are trained by Irene Hull, from KARC in Dromore,As Stella was going deaf when Ann first started to work with her, Irene knew that the OneMind Dogs method of training using body language would be perfect for Ann and Stella.Fiona said: ldquoI really donrsquot know how Ann does it, but she picked up the technique so fast and now her and Stella are so effective together. Ann has become a much better trainer that I am and Stella competes better with her than she did with me.Ann added: ldquoThe only problem I used to have is that Stella would run off to mumshe missed a weave and I couldnrsquot call her back.ldquoConnection is the most important thing for Stella and I at the moment as because she is deaf, I have to keep her looking at me and focusing on me when she is running. I guide her with my hands, feet and my chest laser point.Apart from training, Ann and Stella have a normal loving relationship between a child and a best friend who happens to be a dog.Ann said: ldquoStella loves snacks and as soon as the fridge door opens, she goes wild, spinning in circles of joy.ldquoShersquos allowed to sleep on my bed the nights she has a bath. Thatrsquos what mum and dad think but as soon as they turn off my light, she sneaks under the blanket for a proper snuggle.She has her eyes set on claiming her mumrsquos other dog, Turfy.ldquoMum had her eye on training Turfy as he is fast and very keen, but he loves me more and runs way better for me, said Ann. ldquoI have been training him as well and we should be ready for competitions this summer.Ann hopes to show what she and Stella can do in front of her classmates as her principal has said she can bring the dog into school for a demonstration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 This.jpg","title":"This Is Your Life surprise as David celebrates 100th birthday  ","story":"IT was a case of lsquoThis Is Your Lersquo for retired Carryduff farmer David Patterson when he was presented with a book chronicling  years of his amazing le.Mr Patterson, from the townland of Clontonacally, was surrounded by family, friends and members of his church, Trinity Presbyterian Church in Boardmills, when he celebrated becoming a centenarian at the weekend.For younger readers, This is Your Le was a famous TV programme where celebrities and people of note from all walks of le were surprised by the presenter with a book detailing the personrsquos many achievements.Mr Pattersonrsquos book, lovingly put together by his children, Margaret and Martin, was just one highlight of the weekend of celebrations hosted in his honour.The book shows the many changes that the diary farmer witnessed over the last  years, including pictures of him gathering in hay using horses and carts in the s and s, through to his international travels in later years.His family took him to Las Vegas for his th birthday, which included a helicopter flight over the Grand Canyon.

Leviticus : says to afflict your soulsIt is clear that Jesus commended fasting when speaking to the disciples’ I would never discourage fasting, but only the religious concepts applied to it, such as the ‘Lenten denial’ that Mr Hardy says is a feature of Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Protestant groups and traditions. It is still man made traditions that Jesus said make the Word of God of none effect.Letter to the editor \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In Matthew  He warns not to ‘be like the hypocrites ... but when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to be fasting, but to your Father’. In the Land of Israel there is a national annual fast for  hours on the Day of Atonement, or Yom Kippur, where the whole country comes to a standstill, with no shops or restaurants open, television andradio not broadcast, and even no cars on any roads.This is one example of ‘when’ people fast, and not ‘’.Lent, despite the fact that Jesus never instructed us to copy His suffering and temptation, is much more a ‘token’ fast, often with skipping a meal, giving up chocolate, cigarettes or alcohol, as opposed to the Biblical examples of abstaining completely from food and water for an extended time. Leviticus : says to ‘afflict your souls’.What other nation on earth, other than Israel, honours God on such a national scale, or on an annual basis, unless they are going through some major crisis, such as was the case of national prayer in the UK during WWII  There were still cars on the road however! Lent may expiate the soul for those who find it beneficial, but unlike in Leviticus, we are not commanded to keep ‘Lent’ by God or Jesus.In the case of the epileptic boy’s healing in Matthew  Jesus informs the disciples that their lack of a result was because “this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting,” which demonstrates that there often has to be a practical reason for fasting and not just by habit.Colin Nevin, Bangor "},{"url":null,"title":"united unionist convention not what unionism needs time ","story":"Seven men arrested by PSNI investigating rape allegationNI snow alert worse than originally thought - Met Office issue second NI weather warning within  hoursNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionLettersA United Unionist Convention is not what unionism needs at this timeThe loyalist Billy Hutchinson has proposed a United Unionist Convention.By The NewsroomThursday, th February , : pm\"\"Billy Hutchinson, second from left, and other loyalist and unionist leaders at he Unionist Forum, set up in  due to the loyalist flag protestsBut that is what we always did, back in the day, and it is way too late for that. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Veteransrsquo choirs also provide opportunities in music to a whole new range of people.In another Westminster debate on fire risk in flats and shared housing, I raised the concerns of many constituents relating to building defects, fire safety issues and other matters. I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings. We should be working on this on a UK-wide basis.I also secured my own debate on incineration of industrial and commercial waste. Irsquom supporting campaigners in the east of Cardf who oppose a planned new incinerator and have concerns over emissions and the impact of HGVs near schools and homes.With an existing incinerator near Cardf Bay, and continuing controversy over the biomass plant in Barry docks in our neighbouring constituency, this is an area of concern for many people locally. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Department of Health has said it believes the risk of catching coronavirus from someone with no symptoms at all is low.But because many people with Covid- experience only mild symptoms, particularly during the early stages of the disease, it is possible to catch it from someone who has mild symptoms.ndash Are some groups more at risk The UK Government says that based on current evidence most cases appear to be mild and that those who have died in Wuhan appeared to have pre-existing health conditions.The World Health Organisation has said that about four in five people who contract the virus get mild symptoms and recover.But it added that older people or patients with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes are more at risk of developing serious illness..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Coronavirus February   u all you need to know article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
