I didn’t realise I was an addict until I finally stopped. When I was working I was always ultra-professional and nothing would interfere with the football.‘But when you’re a footballer you have a lot of spare time on your hands after training. It’s easy to sit around and gamble.’Shilton represented England in three World Cups, and said for most players gambling was a way to keep them occupied during long tours away from home.He recalled acting as a bookmaker for the England squad in the 1986 World Cup, when Maradona famously scored with his ‘Hand of God’ goal.When Shilton hung up his gloves in 1997, having competed in more than 1,000 professional matches, he says gambling had begun to rule his life.He said: ‘It’s so easy just to get on that buzz and get hooked. When you gamble you are on a high whether you’re winning or losing. Getting that high to me is what gambling is about, you’re in a world of your own. Shilton said that his problems gravely worsened when online gambling came along, and he set up an account with Betfair in around 2005.‘For the first time I could sit on a computer and bet,’ he said. ‘I just had one account with Betfair. But you could gamble into the early hours of the morning. If I got on a roll I would stay up, on odd occasions to 2am or 3am.’         Goalkeeper Peter Shilton and his ex-England team-mate Gary Lineker (left) at the Marriot Hotel His first marriage broke down in 2011, and he met his second wife Steph in 2012.The couple married in 2016 and live together in a bungalow in West Mersea, Essex.Shilton finally gave up gambling in 2015 with the support and encouragement of his wife.He called up Betfair to ask them to cancel his account – only for them to try and entice him to stay.He said: ‘It was thanks to Steph I was able to give up. The penny suddenly dropped – I thought: “I’m not winning and I never have won ... why should I put myself through this and risk losing Steph?”‘I’ve won at most things in my life, in terms of my career, but I’ve never won at gambling. What’s the point of me carrying on? I’m just losing.’Shilton, who has been plagued by debts from his 45 years of gambling, has now not placed a wager for five years. He said: ‘I could be a lot richer than I am now, but I have never been happier. I will never have another bet again in the rest of my life.’Last Thursday, Shilton and his wife had a meeting with sports minister Nigel Adams and arts minister Helen Whately to discuss the steps needed to tackle the menace of problem gambling.They are also working with the charity Gambling with Lives, which was set up by bereaved parents.Shilton said: ‘I’m now 70, I could just go out quietly. But I just thought I should try and make a difference. Gambling caused me a lot of problems in my life – financial and emotional. I want to help, just one person would be enough.‘I want people to know there is light at the end of the tunnel. You can stop, that’s my message to anyone who is struggling. I understand what you are going through and it’s never easy, but with the right help you can stop.’ Shilton said there should be stricter regulations around betting, adding: ‘What’s frightening is the amount of new methods and games cropping up. The gambling epidemic can only get worse.‘I used to be able to detach a little bit, and wouldn’t bet if I was on holiday. But these days it’s on your phone so you can be sat on a beach placing a bet.’ Shilton said a ban on credit card betting, which was announced last week, was a ‘huge step forward’.But he added: ‘I would like to see gambling education rolled out nationally. I don’t see any difference between that and drugs and sex education.’ He also called for an end to the pervasive advertising and incentives that keep gamblers betting. ‘There are more and more incentives. I used to get a hamper at Christmas from Ladbrokes, when I told a friend of mine – they said, “Well you’re not winning then are you?”’ he said.Shilton said he hoped to work with the Professional Footballers Association to raise awareness of gambling within the game.He and his wife were shocked by the story of Mr Keogh, who was 34 when he took his own life in 2013.He had played for amateur side Headingley FA and secretly accumulated £55,000 in debt from online gambling.Gambling addiction has been linked to self-harm, depression and anxiety and causes two suicides a day in the UK.Shilton received no fee for this article. A donation has been made to Gambling with Lives.  Wife quit job to save him from addiction          Peter Shilton and his wife Steph are pictured at home in West Mersea, Colchester, EssexSteph Shilton emailed Betfair six years ago begging them to cut off her husband Peter’s account – but says they failed to act.She was shocked by the grip gambling had on the football legend when she met him in 2012, and embarked on a mission to get him to quit.She left her job to help him through withdrawal symptoms, and will next week meet Government ministers to discuss ways to help other addicts.‘It was heartbreaking to think this national treasure, this wonderful football icon, had this problem,’ she said. She decided to become an ‘investigator’ and rifled through the footballer’s bank statements to uncover the scale of his addiction.Mrs Shilton, 51, who worked as a manager in NHS primary care for 20 years, said: ‘It was a chronic illness and I knew he needed me. I looked at it as a medical condition, just like a drug addiction.’In 2014, she emailed Betfair, ‘begging and pleading’ with them to close her husband’s account. But she said they replied claiming they were unable to take any action because of data protection rules.‘I am so angry at the way they treated him, and the fact I made them aware of my concerns but they ignored my plea,’ she said.She was forced to try other tactics, including separating herself financially.‘I told Pete for a long time that I didn’t have a credit card when I did,’ she said. ‘I told him I had lent a friend my savings, I said anything so I didn’t feed him the drug which is money.‘A lot of men find it hard to seek help or open up about their financial disasters. I kept reiterating that he could tell me anything. I also tried to replace the mentality of winning with that of losing, calling the Racing Post the Loser’s Post.’In 2015, three years after they got together, the former goalkeeper placed his last bet.Mrs Shilton said: ‘I remember the day where he did give up. He said “I’m losing, and I’m worried I’m going to lose you”. I said, “You’re never going to lose me, but we’ve got to move on”.’Shilton then picked up the phone to Betfair to cancel his account. Stopping gambling caused three months of withdrawal symptoms including sleepless nights, mood swings and irritability.Mrs Shilton said: ‘I gave up work to commit to helping him. I wanted him so much to overcome it that giving up my career was unquestionable. Each day we went on long walks.‘It took me about a year to stop worrying, I was still checking his laptop and throwing away the racing pages in the newspaper.’She now hopes to return to work in the NHS, and is determined to help other families struggling with gambling.She will meet health minister Nadine Dorries next week to discuss becoming involved in the 14 NHS gambling clinics around the country.She said: ‘It is so right that the NHS look after the addicts, but the public should not foot the bill. Gambling firms must take their responsibility.‘GPs also need to get on board and be educated far better on gambling addiction.’Mrs Shilton added: ‘As long as you love each other, you will pull through. We now have a second life. We have disposable income and can go on nice weekends or nice meals.’Shilton split from his first wife in 2011. They married in 1970 and have two sons.A Betfair spokesman said: ‘We cannot publicly comment on inidual customer accounts. Over the past few years we have significantly strengthened our responsible gambling practices, including limit-setting and other tools, and have invested in technology to help us proactively identify and engage with customers who may be at risk.’The Shiltons are supporting the charity Gambling with Lives which was set up by bereaved parents who have lost children to gambling addiction. "},{"url":null,"title":"Were hidden messages Prince Harrys speech","story":"Share this article          In his speech (pictured), the Duke of Sussex said he and his wife were standing down from the Royal Family with \u0027great sadness\u0027, but there was \u0027no other option\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"RICHARD KAY Queens sake Harry start think acts","story":"Share this article And to be fair there was humility in his words too as he spoke of his \u0027utmost respect for my grandmother, my commander in chief\u0027.He also acknowledged how grateful he was to the Queen and \u0027the rest of my family\u0027 for the support they have shown Meghan.But that gratitude is somewhat tested by remarks made as he attempted to put his side of the story.\u0027What I want to make clear is we\u0027re not walking away,\u0027 he said. \u0027Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately that wasn\u0027t possible.\u0027As an ex-soldier, with distinguished service in Afghanistan, quite apart from his work with veterans and the Invictus Games he founded for wounded, injured and disabled veterans, losing those Army links clearly hurts.Elsewhere in the speech, if it wasn\u0027t his mother\u0027s influence it was his wife\u0027s, who he was proud to say \u0027upholds the same values as I do\u0027.

And using an Americanism he added: \u0027I know I haven\u0027t always gotten it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option.\u0027Really? Some might say that after less than two years as a working royal couple, Harry and Meghan had barely got started.After all he stresses his commitment to duty and service. You can almost hear the anguish in his voice when he says at one point: \u0027We were here to serve.\u0027So why aren\u0027t they? And what went wrong in his mind that stopped them doing just that?When royal couples in the past have struggled matrimonially or with the burden of their role, the Queen has always been a sympathetic ear.But she also has the \u0027five-year test\u0027. Don\u0027t do anything hasty, let\u0027s see how things work out over five years, is her measured response. In recent years both the Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex have been challenged by searching public criticism and they have emerged as two of the most reliable and popular members of the Royal Family.And what about Camilla, Harry\u0027s stepmother? No royal figure has taken more knocks in public life but she has been quietly transformed as Duchess of Cornwall performing a vital role as Prince Charles\u0027s consort.Even Charles and Diana delayed their separation at her request to try to make the marriage work.The more one looks at the whole sorry situation it does seem the Sussexes decision to walk away is one made in haste. But then everything about them has happened at speed.From that first meeting – a blind date in a London restaurant – to Harry almost immediately whisking Meghan away to camp out in the Botswana bush to her settling in to cosy Nottingham Cottage, his London home at Kensington Palace, everything has been at pace. Everything conducted like a holiday romance – him in Canada, both going to Africa, she visiting England – but with drama at every turn. And in the flash of an eye they were engaged, married and undertaking big overseas tours.Was it any wonder that after that breathless trip to Africa – its brilliance overshadowed by the spectacularly misjudged decision to complain about their life in the spotlight in a television interview – they needed a break.Seven weeks of introspection later they appeared to make their announcement without any real thought about its impact and now find themselves fire-fighting public anger and disappointment at their treatment of the 93-year-old Queen.Perhaps this was really why Harry spoke as he did.The Harry I know will be desperately torn over the repercussions of his decision to walk away. One thing he could do which would assuage public criticism concerns his promise to repay the £2.4million of taxpayers\u0027 money spent on Frogmore Cottage.Rather than have it transferred into an anonymous fund where it will be used to the repair costs of royal properties, a friend of the prince has suggested he earmark it for a specific project such as a school or a hospice.Diana would certainly have approved. When she learned of the money being used to build the Millennium Dome in 1997, she pleaded with ministers to spend the estimated £750million on a new regional hospital instead. Her wishes, alas, were ignored."},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan beams carrying Archie walking dogs Harry boards flight Vancouver","story":"Share this articleVictoria couple\u0027s brush with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle goes viral across the world | CTV NewsPrince Harry ends feud with William in secret peace talks with Meghan and Kate – but he’s still at war with Charles – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Libby Purves says women calling equal wages BBC not large payouts","story":"Share this article She claimed she was owed almost £700,000 in back pay, having been paid £440 an episode for the BBC Newswatch programme compared with Mr Vine\u0027s £3,000 an episode for Points of View.

He accumulated paper, squirrelled it away, and never threw anything out. He was a hoarder.Every kind of paper has its qualities – even the most disposable, or the nastiest wallpaper pattern. All of which Picasso was alert to, a connoisseur of the cheap and mass produced as well as the handmade and the specialised, as he folded, glued together, cut and tore, basted in ink and washes, drew on and rubbed into. Paper for him was a medium (just as was paint, clay or plaster) to be manipulated. And as he worked he was always finding, losing and refinding his subjects, whether it was a fish or a faun, a woman or a guitar, a portrait or a skull. The multiple transformations he performed in his art evidence his unnerving vitality, his recklessness and confidence, his altogether too-muchness.Picasso and sculpture, Picasso and photography, Picasso and the theatre, Picasso and ceramics, Picasso and Matisse, Picasso’s Picassos … is there no end to the ways in which the artist has been re-examined, in exhibition after exhibition, study after study, both during his long career and even more since his death aged 91, in 1973? And let’s not forget the biopics, the Guernica souvenir key-rings or the car that bears his name. You might imagine that the artist would be buried under all that evaluation, all that adulation, all those analyses, not just of his work but also of his personal life, all those relationships, all that cruelty and monstrousness and machismo and all the ephemeral junk, never mind all that art. And now Picasso and Paper, filling the Royal Academy galleries.All that said, there is always more to be said, so much to look at. What this exhibition provides is but one more overview, whose backbone is his entire career, a rehearsal of movements and moments that takes us from his very earliest cut-out paper figures of a characterful, squat little terrier and a dove, made when he was eight or nine, to a skull-like self-portrait, drawn the year before he died. Hanging alone on a white wall, an urgent hurry of black-and-white crayon, it looks back at us at us and everything we’ve encountered through room after room, filled with both major and minor developments in his art.Somewhere along the way those earliest, cut-out little creatures return, in scissored paper shapes cut by an adult: a cuttlefish, a feather, light bulbs and a fishing float, and nasty little paper faces and skulls whose eyes and mouths have been burned through the paper, most likely with the tip of a lighted cigarette. He made these last, gruesome shreds in Paris in 1942. They stop me short, a sort of human litter, a deathly confetti.The variety of the works here, their registers and application, range through all the periods of Picasso’s development. Each section of the show is accompanied by key paintings and sculptures of their times. A life-sized reproduction Les Demoiselles d’Avignon takes the place of the real thing, while the scale of Guernica (itself a kind of drawing as much as it is a painting) is indicated by Dora Maar’s series of black-and-white photographs of the painting in progress, wedged at an angle in the big loft space where Picasso painted it. Picasso filled 16 notebooks, as well as making innumerable inidual studies, in his preparation of Les Demoiselles, and Guernica was subject to almost as much preparation and revision. We are apt to forget how much thinking went on in the lead up to many of his paintings and sculptures.He took his own photographs too, notably here of the huddled buildings on the lower river Ebro, one of the formative places where he began to develop the idea of cubism. As much as cubism is rich with the atmosphere of Paris bars, a glass of wine and the newspaper and the urban everyday, it was also the product of the tightly packed jumbled buildings in Horta de Ebro, in Cadaqués and the high Pyrenean village of Gósol. Cubism was also an art of collage and bricolage, the found and the invented coming together.While each section of the exhibition alights on a major theme – cubism and neo-classicism and surrealism, with Picasso’s relationship with Marie-Thérèse Walter, the war years and his later re-engagement with Manet and Delacroix – the pleasures of the exhibition are in inidual works, in all their variety of touches and tempos. The wonderful tiny card and string guitars, delicate confections made with twine and card sewn on to a discarded pharmaceutical packet, those little cut-outs, drawings of mad faces, a plaster cast of a crumpled sheet of paper, like a gigantic mollusc or a loaf, the overdrawings he did on Vogue fashion spreads and pin-up shots, cartoonish figures and the closely observed all come together here it is clear that drawing and its manipulations of edges and spaces, volume and flatness is at the heart of everything for Picasso. Even his poems are drawn as much as written. He couldn’t seem to stop himself.There is a story that once, in a cafe in the south of France, the patron asked if Picasso might do a little doodle, on a paper tablecloth or the menu as a memento. The artist shrugged and said he’d just like to pay for the meal – he didn’t want to buy the restaurant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/108116e997c626e07dc0ecee59cf9a854ea21943/90_573_2514_1508/master/2514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73ebbcaff4cd01b6204995a7f5c0ace2","title":"van gogh self portrait authentic psychosis","story":"Only known painting by Dutch master while he had psychosis is ‘unmistakably’ his workAfter decades of doubt, a gloomy self-portrait has been authenticated as a genuine work by Vincent van Gogh and the only known work painted while he had psychosis.Self-Portrait (1889) has been in Norway’s national collection since 1910 but its authenticity has been openly questioned since 1970. On Monday, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam announced it was “unmistakably” a work by the artist.In the portrait, dated August 1889, the artist’s expression is lifeless and the image is dominated by a dreary and downbeat greenish-brown tone.“The Oslo self-portrait depicts someone who is mentally ill,” the museum said. “His timid, sideways glance is easily recognisable and is often found in patients suffering from depression and psychosis.”Van Gogh admitted himself to a small asylum in Saint-Rémy, France, in May 1889 and was struck down by a severe psychotic episode in July that lasted for a month and a half.The painting can be linked to a letter that the artist wrote to his brother Theo in September, about a self-portrait “attempt from when I was ill”.Louis van Tilborgh, a senior researcher at the museum and professor of art history at the University of Amsterdam, said Van Gogh was frightened to admit he was in a similar state to other residents at the asylum.“He probably painted this portrait to reconcile himself with what he saw in the mirror: a person he did not wish to be, yet was,” he said.“This is part of what makes the painting so remarkable and even therapeutic. It is the only work that Van Gogh is known for certain to have created while suffering from psychosis.”The Nasjonalmuseet in Oslo purchased the painting in 1910, making it – in theory – the first Van Gogh self-portrait to enter a public collection. But because of an incomplete provenance and questions over its style and use of colour, some experts doubted its authenticity.The Nasjonalmuseet asked the Van Gogh Museum to undertake a comprehensive inspection of its style, technique, material and provenance in 2014, and it is the results of these investigations that were revealed on Monday.Mai Britt Guleng, a curator at the Nasjonalmuseet, said it was reassuring the painting had been confirmed as genuine.“When we delivered the painting in ‘14 they warned us and said ‘you might not like the results’ and it might be that we will never find out. So we were very happy when we got the news.”One reason for previous doubts about the work’s authenticity was Van Gogh’s use of a palette knife to flatten parts of the painting, thought to be unusual. “It’s not,” said Van Tilborgh. “He uses it often and there is another picture where he has used it to suppress the liveliness of the surface, it’s only strange that he has used it for the face.”Van Tilborgh believes the artist was trying to deliberately drain the life from the portrait and that reflected his state of mind. “He attached much more value to getting something which was intensely expressive,” he said.“This is not the best picture that Van Gogh made but I have grown quite fond of it. He says later on somewhere that his paintings were sometimes a cry of anguish. Well, this is a cry of anguish. It belongs to a small group of pictures that show something of his mental health problem and how he dealt with it, or tried to deal with it.”Van Gogh would have been looking in a mirror as he was painting so the ear in view is his right one, not the one he famously severed with a razor blade in December 1888. The ear in the Oslo painting is vague and presumably deliberately so.Van Gogh wrote on 22 August 1889 that he was still “disturbed” but felt able to paint again. The newly authenticated self-portrait was followed in the following three weeks by two famous and much more vibrant self-portraits, which are in the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC and the Musée d’Orsay in Paris.Seen together, the portraits show a man gradually becoming less fragile, although it was not to last. Within a year he was dead, aged only 37, after he shot himself in an apparent suicide.The painting is on display at the Van Gogh Museum and will be part of a temporary exhibition, titled In the Picture, from 21 February. It will then return to Oslo to be displayed as part of the Nasjonalmuseet’s permanent collection when a new building opens in spring 2021."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/239d7d72a74eb55c73d19e5db0237e79fa593e2a/0_229_5070_3042/master/5070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91566b1161a7c88288ebc085e2598de","title":"strummer holidays guitar shaped hotel party never stops hard rock beyonce suite","story":"It’s got laser-beam strings, balcony showers and a 13-acre pool.

The curving colossus pulsates with neon stripes, rising up the body of the building to its crown – where six laser-beam “strings” shoot light 20,000 feet into the sky, creating a phantom guitar neck that dissolves into the clouds.It is an unlikely thing to find standing in the middle of this non-place of parking lots, e bars and pawn shops. And it is all the more remarkable given that it has been built by a community that was almost hounded from existence. The hotel is the work of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, a Native American group whose population on the peninsula numbered 200,000, when Spanish colonisers first arrived in the 1500s. Following centuries of persecution and displacement, the tribe now has just over 4,000 members, scattered across six sites around the state and headquartered in the 500-acre Hollywood reservation, where the Hard Rock hotel now stands.In many ways, the flashy new building is a fitting symbol of Seminole defiance. Known as the “unconquered tribe”, they have long boasted of their status as the only Native American tribe to refuse to sign a peace treaty with the US government. Following the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the vast majority of tribe members were forcibly relocated to the Indian Territory in Oklahoma, over 1,000 miles to the west. But a couple of hundred Seminoles hid in the Everglades, led by such legendary chiefs as Osceola and Billy Bowlegs, where they camped out for decades and resisted government forces. With a name that derives from the Spanish word “cimarrones”, meaning runaways or wild ones, the Seminoles have proved a force to be reckoned with ever since.They began their entrepreneurial endeavours by opening lucrative tax-free tobacco shops in the 1970s, then became the first tribe in the country to establish a casino, in the form of a high-stakes bingo hall in 1979. The legal battle that ensued ended with a district court ruling in favour of the Seminoles and ultimately led to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, a federal law allowing all Native American tribes to operate casinos, as long as they shared some of the revenue with their state’s governments. It has since mushroomed into a $34bn industry.“The Seminoles really are the pioneers of Indian gambling,” says Professor Bob Jarvis, expert in gaming history at Florida’s Nova Southeastern University. “They went from being an extremely impoverished tribe, eking out a subsistence living, to being fabulously wealthy in a generation.” A year after the Seminoles’ bingo hall opened, revenue had reached $1m a month. By 1999, gambling was generating about $96m a year for the tribe. After acquiring the Hard Rock International brand in 2006, and pursuing an aggressive programme of global expansion, their income now stands at over $5bn a year.The change in fortunes has seen tribe members going from living in primitive thatched “chickee” huts to owning fleets of SUVs, boats and swamp buggies, along with second homes on the coast. Each tribe member receives an annual allowance of around $128,000, plus access to free private school and college tuition and universal health care. By the time Seminole children turn 18, they are already multimillionaires. The wealth is only set to grow, too, particularly as the tribe recently suspended its revenue-sharing agreement with the state of Florida over an exclusivity rights dispute.With this history in mind, the brash swagger of the new hotel seems apt. It stands proudly as a huge guitar-shaped middle finger up to the white man who tried to eradicate their entire race, making do instead with corralling them into the most inhospitable parts of the country – which they have turned to their advantage. “We always exiled the Indians to the worst possible land, the land no white settler wanted,” says Jarvis. “The Hollywood reservation was way out in the middle of nowhere, where civilisation was never going to come, but they’ve transformed it into a destination.”Not far from where the original bingo hall still stands, now just a low-slung shed marooned in a parking lot, they have created a tropical mirage, complete with its own water-sports lagoon and beach, along with poolside suites where you can swim up to your front door. Visitors are welcomed into an atrium where a circular waterfall gushes down from a timber halo, while marble-lined corridors lead to 19 different restaurants and cafes, a gambling hall the size of three American football fields and a 7,000-capacity concert venue opened by Maroon 5. Other attractions include a nightclub that transforms into a “dayclub”, so you can party and gamble 247, immune from the sobering glare of daylight.At the same time, the newfound riches of the Seminoles have had their own damaging effects, leading to high levels of drug and alcohol abuse, obesity and mental health problems. The Seminole tribe says it has worked with the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling to create a “comprehensive array of programmes that ensure a safe and entertaining gaming environment”.The development is the brainchild of Jim Allen, the man who has led the Seminoles to unimaginable riches since he started working for them in 2001. As a gaming industry veteran and former vice-president of the Trump Organisation, he was the one to convince the tribe to acquire the Hard Rock company in 2006, for $965m – the first time a Native American tribe purchased a major international corporation. As tribe member Max Osceola Jr said at the time: “Our ancestors sold Manhattan for trinkets. Today, with the acquisition of the Hard Rock Cafes, we’re going to buy Manhattan back one hamburger at a time.”Under Allen’s leadership, the company has tripled the number of hotel outposts, including resorts in the Dominican Republic, Mexico and India, and has further plans for bases in Dubai and China. But Allen wanted an unmistakable landmark for the Seminoles’ spiritual home. “We were really interested in the big guitars that were in front of many of the Hard Rock locations,” he says, recalling the origins of the design. “So I said in passing, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if we could do a hotel out of this?’ I didn’t specifically mean to do it – it was just a throwaway comment.”His architects, the Las Vegas entertainment specialists Klai Juba Wald initially came back with a square box with a guitar shape stuck on the front. “I said no,” says Allen. “The actual building needs to be shaped like a guitar. That was it.”The resulting structure is as bluntly articulated as Allen describes it. It has the crude detailing of architecture designed to be seen from a distance, but it is a finish that fits with the unashamedly tacky nature of the whole endeavour. This is a machine for attracting attention, for pedalling fantasies and extracting people’s money. And, judging by the crowds at the slot machines on a Thursday afternoon and the dozens guzzling down $75 steaks in the grill house, it appears to be doing quite well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/011010f75f14cf6f17b17aa97a7290618a5dc5a4/0_126_3112_1867/master/3112.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adb083aaea9fd68244ed7fb33f1d5aa8","title":"sajid javid brexit ft interview","story":"The chancellor has dashed any hope that the government might move beyond slogansShockwaves ran through industry over the weekend following the chancellor’s alarming interview with the Financial Times. If anyone thought Brexit would be wisely “done” once election posturing was over, what a disappointment. Sajid Javid has shown that political positioning still shapes policy, and that ministers are still under threat from Dominic Cummings, the bully “adviser” of No 10, with his “continuous appraisals” and “delivery dashboard”.Without nuance or caution, Javid warned: “There will not be alignment, we will not be a rule-taker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union.” Yes, “there will be an impact on business”, which had to “adjust” to the new reality: companies had had time to prepare, though “admittedly they didn’t know the exact terms”. No one does, as manufacturers protest at his refusal to disclose which EU rules he rejects. As Cummings said: “We are not interested in level playing fields.” That makes no deal or only a minuscule deal dangerously possible.Well aware of what no alignment portends, the cabinet minister Michael Gove last week reconvened the emergency XO (Exit Operations) committee to prepare for a “disorderly” Brexit in December. Will he repeat the monstrous waste of £2.1bn allocated for Operation Yellowhammer ferries, motorway closures, stockpiling and freezers for the do-or-die 31 October Brexit? The EU trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, said the December 2020 timeframe was “impossible”, but here is No 10’s reply: “We are not bluffing on no extension.” The EU always said fisheries came first – nothing would be agreed until fishing inside our 12-mile limit was agreed – the most emotionally fraught of all issues. Fisheries may be an economic tiddler, but national identity and the romance of the sea matters more than money on both sides of the Channel. Who will blink first?Javid’s abrasive Brexitry dashed industry hopes that a stonking 80-seat majority would allow the government to devote itself seriously to the practicalities of prosperity, growth and productivity. His words drew this despairing view from one engineering company chief executive: “Self-serving complacency! To bring in ergent regulation is purely doctrinaire and ideological, as it makes no sense on the ground,” said Andrew Varga of Seetru, a manufacturer of industrial valves. “Europe’s CE kitemark is gold standard and all that’s needed, but they spit on it just because it’s European: they want ‘Great British’ standards.”To keep the treasured CE mark, Varga has taken on the expense of bringing in a German auditor three times a year, a new computer system and having staff check his 30,000 product configurations, his perimeter fences and staff security. In all it is costing £750,000 from his £11.5m turnover, meaning no new staff are being employed. “That is money I should spend on improving productivity and our next innovations. Now they want a separate UK label to be engineered in, with humungous costs if I need UK auditors and inspections as well.”Ask quite different industries and you get the same answer. “Frightening and stupid” was Nigel Baker’s response to the Javid interview. His company, Calico Cottage, makes chocolate and exports it to France and Germany. Is he prepared? He’s indignant, as he has failed to get official information on what forms and codes he needs. Some of his products have 15 ingredients with origins around the world, all needing certificates at each crossing. “The Department for Exiting the European Union, HMRC and the Cabinet Office couldn’t explain. They hadn’t a clue, so I’ve just guessed, and I hope no one checks.”Wright points out much of his industry is based in the Midlands and north of England, risking good manufacturing jobs in the very places Boris Johnson has pledged to “level up”. Any ergence in any part of each industry threatens companies and jobs. The Confederation of British Industry is cowed, but businesses are aghast at the recklessness of a chancellor they fear doesn’t know or care what his words will mean for their sectors.This is a government still in electioneering mode, floating airy ideas for eye-catching headlines with those “bobs for bongs”, the Lords sent to York, or a revolutionary assault on Whitehall mandarins. But these showboating announcements quickly evaporate as frothy impossibles. And in 11 months’ time Brexit will hit the hard place where voters will find it isn’t “done” at all.

Before the fedora, there was Fédora, an 1882 play which, the OED tells us, was perhaps most memorable for its stylish lead Sarah Bernhardt:The name of the play and its heroine appear to have been adopted slightly earlier for various items of womenswear, including hats.One moment. Felt headgear and 19th-century fictional women … felt headgear and 19th-century fictional women … that’s it! I was thinking of the fedora’s cousin.Yes: the trilby. Previously Trilby, heroine of an 1894 novel, then slang for a foot (Trilby in the book had tremendous feet), next a kind of shoe, opportunistically trademarked in America … and, most enduringly, a felt hat with a shape either similar to or completely dissimilar to that of the fedora, depending how much or how little you pay attention to headgear.The novel? Its millinery legacy is perhaps its creator’s third-largest achievement. His second is being grandfather not only to the five boys who inspired Peter Pan but also to a novelist whose name also endures: he was George and she remains Daphne du Maurier.And his largest achievement? For a long time, they said it was his talent to coin phrases used to this day. Case in point: “bedside manner”, originally meant facetiously, as it appears in this 1884 du Maurier cartoon for Punch. One problem: we see the same phrase used, with, I think, the same side-eye, in a novel of 1869:The expression most associated with Du Maurier is “curate’s egg”, thanks to another Punch cartoon in which a nervous clergyman attempts good manners:TRUE HUMILITY. Right Reverend Host. “I’M AFRAID YOU’VE GOT A BAD EGG, MR. JONES!” The Curate. “OH NO, MY LORD, I ASSURE YOU! PARTS OF IT ARE EXCELLENT!”Two problems this time. The first is that “curate’s egg” is not as enduring as it seems, since it has effectively lost its meaning. It served a useful purpose for a while in offering a short way of saying something quite involved: “any part of this being bad would spoil the whole thing – and has – but I am choosing to say that some of it is good, either knowingly, to cushion the blow, or with sarcasm”. As often as not, though, it’s used to mean something more like “a mixed bag”, which seems a shame when we already have expressions like “a mixed bag”.We discussed this tendency for phrases to lose nuance before then, I had not yet read last year’s piece on “curate’s egg” at Garson O’Toole’s Quote Investigator – a site I trust, for what its worth. It seems that earlier the same year, the less celebrated satirical magazine Judy had a cartoon in which someone tries to be polite about an unpleasant egg. Perhaps, though, Du Maurier had introduced the social context which gives the joke its punch?He had not. Here’s the caption for Judy’s cartoon:SCENE – BISHOP’S BREAKFAST TABLE.Bishop (to timid Curate on a visit). DEAR ME, I’M AFRAID YOUR EGG’S NOT GOOD!Timid Curate. OH, YES, MY LORD, REALLY – ER – SOME PARTS OF IT ARE VERY GOOD.Judy’s editor made a fuss, perhaps unaware that the whole being-polite-to-a-bishop-about-an-egg thing had been the subject of an anecdote which seems to have been knocking around for at least 20 years.Given that I wouldn’t be astonished to discover that there was already a play called Trilby about a woman with nice feet, this brings us to our next challenge.

If officials get their way, the city will be split into zones, and, rather than driving direct, motorists will have to use the ring road for all zone-to-zone journeys.Those travelling by foot and bicycle in the new Brum won’t be inconvenienced: their journeys will be simple and – with fewer cars – safer. With cars out of the way, bus journeys will become swifter and more reliable.The Birmingham transport plan, launched last week, was influenced by Ghent’s zone-centred traffic circulation plan of 2017. This medieval Belgian city – a quarter of the size of Birmingham – demonstrated that it was possible to switch attitudes overnight. Streets were blocked to motorists one Sunday evening and – to the disappointment of the waiting media –there was no wailing, no gnashing of teeth, no gridlock.Retailers and restaurants that had warned of Armageddon discovered that takings did not plummet.A year after the imposition of the traffic circulation plan – in news that may encourage similarly minded politicians around the world, Watteeuw was re-elected with an increased majority.Another advantage of the intervention is that it is remarkably cheap to implement Ghent’s plan cost just €4m (£3.4m) to implement. By comparison it costs an estimated £20m-£30m to build just one mile of motorway.A great deal of Ghent’s traffic congestion was found to have been caused by an excess of short car journeys – as planners had accurately modelled.“We had people complaining that a drive of 300 metres became a car journey of two kilometres,” remembers Watteeuw. “We had to explain that we don’t want people to use a car for 300 metres: they should walk.”Before the introduction of Ghent’s circulation plan, all that could be heard was the cacophony of cars, complained the resident, but “now he hears birdsong”, Watteeuw said.“Instead of car noise,” he adds, “people can now hear each other talking and children laughing.”For Mel Jones, Birmingham city council’s head of transport planning, taming cars can’t come soon enough.“Growth in Birmingham’s population will result in 1.2 million additional daily trips across our highways network by 2031,” she says. “Accommodating all these trips by private car is simply not sustainable.”Road widening is off the table, she adds. It’s expensive, unpopular – and doesn’t work.“We need to look at ways of keeping the city moving in a sustainable and efficient way,” says Jones.“Reducing pressure on kerb space” will “provide improved penetration and accessibility by public transport in the city centre,” promises the plan. “Public transport and cycling provision will be prioritised over car parking provision.”The “allocation of road space will change away from single occupancy private cars,” the council says, because the priority should be “moving people, not vehicles”.Freight deliveries will be restricted to out-of-hours, and there will be a blanket 20mph speed limit across the city’s local roads.Birmingham must “build a future in which the car will no longer be king”, says Waseem Zaffar, the city council cabinet member for transport and environment.Cars, he adds, are “bad for the health of ourselves and our families, bad for our communities and bad for business as measured by the millions of pounds of lost productivity caused by congestion”.Watteeuw advises Birmingham’s councillors not to stagger any changes.“In Ghent, we implemented the plan as a whole overnight,” he says. “It was technically and politically the easiest way.”The Birmingham transport plan goes out to public consultation soon. Watteeuw – who received death threats before the implementation of the plan – urges the residents of Birmingham not to allow loud voices and vested interests to derail the process.“Talk to people, but be persistent, and don’t give in on the plan’s principal benefits,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d11998b8554b2d222bde6fd1ca78d7cbcd9746d8/46_52_1645_987/master/1645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c88b9ec971347f58eaea19edddffb305","title":"what did jack do review david lynch netflix short film","story":"In this two-hander, the director plays a cop interrogating a capuchin monkey accused of murder – which is as funny and absurd as it soundsDropping short films without warning is the new rock’n’roll for A-list directors right now: Paul Thomas Anderson did it with the dance piece Anima and Jonathan Glazer did it with his nightmarish The Fall. Now it is the turn of no less a figure than David Lynch, who has released a characteristically strange and funny 17-minute two-hander entitled What Did Jack Do? on Netflix, created under the production auspices of the Fondation Cartier pour l’Art Contemporain in Paris. (Perhaps it will be on permanent view there after it leaves Netflix.)It is in black-and-white, with cod-scratches on the print, the result being something not merely ancient but unearthly looking, as if recovered from some cinemathèque archive on a distant planet. It looks very much like Lynch’s famed debut Eraserhead, but with an eerie cop-procedural grammar, and an emphasis on coffee that might put you in mind of Twin Peaks.Lynch himself plays a cop in dark suit and tie, distractedly smoking a cigarette, in what could be any modern era before the indoor smoking ban. Across a tiny and oddly secluded table in what appears to be a railroad station cafe, he is interrogating a suspect, whom he has managed to track down to this station because his train was delayed. And this suspect is … a capuchin monkey named Jack Cruz. This trained animal speaks in a croaky, strained voice (possibly provided by Lynch himself) out of a human mouth deepfaked into the lower half of the monkey’s face. The closeups on Jack’s face and head movements contrived by Lynch and cinematographer Scott Ressler give us a bizarrely convincing sense of someone defiant, yet haunted and evasive, and also pleadingly wide-eyed. As their tense confrontation continues, it becomes clear that Jack may or may not be guilty of murder: killing someone called Max for carrying on with a chicken named Toototabon (is this an anagram?), with whom Jack is passionately and noir-ishly in love.While they wait for their coffee to arrive, their conversation is surreal, disjointed, speckled with bizarre non-sequiturs, like a dialogue between two sleep-talkers: it sounds as if Lynch has mischievously generated the script by some sort of quasi-randomised computer programme. The dialogue is always on the verge of collapsing into gibberish, but never quite does. There is something oddly poignant about the way Jack complains about how he is being treated in this highly irregular interrogation: “You toss an animal on the roof just to see the look on his face.”There are walk-ons from the long-suffering waitress and the co-respondent in this crime of passion, and Jack himself gives us a song: a thoroughly and almost parodically Lynchian moment that I couldn’t help laughing at. No more than an exercise in style – but what distinctive style."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/740786fa615ac0a040405115110f651e37b1a3e7/0_42_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce80ed62aae162c9ed552ffd721bcae3","title":"jonathan pryce theres a definite shortage of 72 year old welsh men","story":"The actor talks about his Oscar nomination for The Two Popes and his new role as Don Quixote, before moving on to the vexed subject of inequality in the movie industryIt is the day after the Oscar nominations, and Jonathan Pryce is perched at a corner table in a humdrum London bar, guest of honour at the saddest celebration in town. His first best-actor nomination has been a long time coming. At the age of 72, he has arrived. “Best newcomer,” he says ruefully. “Although I already do have a best newcomer award. It was for Breaking Glass. Back in 1980.”It is no surprise to see Pryce honoured for his lovely performance in The Two Popes, a likable Netflix drama that spotlights the bromance between Benedict and Francis, but it knocked him sideways all the same. He had not thought he stood a chance he had just come out of the shower when the news came through. Since then, his phone has barely stopped buzzing. Congratulations and requests. Demands on his time. “But it’s great,” he adds quickly, and almost sounds as if he means it.Whether by accident or design, Pryce has spent much of his career as the quiet man of British acting the coiled spring in the works, unobtrusive, precise and usually critical, whether he is playing a Bond villain on screen or Shylock on stage Cardinal Wolsey in Wolf Hall or the High Sparrow in Game of Thrones. Like Pope Francis, perhaps, he is the connoisseur’s choice, the progressive dark horse. Still, you should never make the mistake of confusing an actor with the characters they play.His latest appearance, in Terry Gilliam’s The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, brings him full circle. It was Gilliam who provided Pryce with his breakthrough role in 1985’s Brazil, and the two have remained firm friends ever since. The film itself is a rackety, rambunctious affair. Adam Driver headlines as a jaded commercials director at large in rural Spain. Pryce co-stars as Javier, a deluded old shoemaker who fancies himself as Quixote. He comes clip-clopping through the desert in tin-pan armour, his peevish stare fixed on the far horizon.The way Pryce tells it, he was essentially playing two men at the same time. “And that’s the get-out-of-jail card. Because if I’m not very good as Don Quixote, you can blame it on the shoemaker, who’s not a very good actor. But also Quixote’s playing a role himself, the noble knight. So it’s all role play and the masks are always slipping.”Pryce was offered a slot in Gilliam’s first, ill-fated, stab at the film in 2000, but turned it down because he thought the script was weak. Since then, the role of Quixote has bounced from Jean Rochefort to John Hurt to Michael Palin before landing in Pryce’s lap. Gilliam now suspects this was preordained. “Jonathan has basically been waiting to play this part ever since our first collapse,” he says.The director has said some other things, too. Earlier this month, Gilliam told the journalist Alexandra Pollard that #MeToo was a witch-hunt. He said that women in Hollywood should take more responsibility for themselves and that he was “tired of white men being blamed for everything”. But that’s Terry, Pryce says. “He’s always been a provocateur. That’s what he thrives on: being outrageous, going to extremes.” Besides, he adds, the whole #MeToo issue remains so fresh and raw people are still working out how to discuss it. “That’s not to say he was misunderstood or misconstrued,” he adds. “I think it was very clear what he was saying.”Until now, I have filed Gilliam and Pryce as odd-couple collaborators: the disreputable old goat and his cerebral, soft-spoken alter ego. Pryce nods. “The straight man and the clown. Except that, in this case, the clown is playing the role of straight man. Meanwhile, I’m stuck on the horse, playing the clown.”In contrast to Gilliam, Pryce would rather stay out of the limelight steer clear of trouble. By and large, he has been successful. But in 1991, he sparked fury in the US with his portrayal of a Eurasian pimp called the Engineer in the Broadway production of Miss Saigon. Equity labelled the role “an affront to the Asian community” and demanded he withdraw. The ensuing standoff almost derailed the production.I ask whether, three decades on, he has more sympathy for Equity’s objection. He says that, on the contrary, he had sympathy for it then. The experience was horrific. He felt like the lightning rod for a wider cultural storm. “I mean, I was always confident that I wasn’t portraying a stereotype,” he insists. “But all I could do was sit back and let other people have the argument. And I got support from very strange and unwanted quarters. Charlton Heston sent me a photo of him playing Fu Manchu. He signed it: ‘From one yellowface to another.’ And I thought: ‘That’s not what I’m doing, Charlton. Thanks for your support.’”The point is that Pryce had always been at pains to work with multi-ethnic casts. In Stratford, on Broadway, wherever it was. “So you’re thinking: ‘What the hell is this? I’m the nice guy here.’ But that’s the way change happens. It showed there was an inequality in the casting process. It’s just tough when you’re on the receiving end.”It infuriated him then. It still rankles today. “You know, I was in New York recently, at an influencer, as I think they call them. Academy members watch your film. You meet them. Schmooze-fest. And this Asian lady grabbed my arm and was shouting: ‘I protest you! I protest you!’ Talking about what she’d done 30 years ago. ‘I stuck paper down your toilet in the theatre!’ Because we had protesters who used to come to the show to disrupt it.”Pryce appears to be giving the protester a comedy accent. I hope this wasn’t the voice he used for his Eurasian pimp. Anyway, he continues, the upshot was that, at the end of this rant, she still wanted to have her picture taken with him. “And then, in the photo, she’s pointing like this in my face. Saying: ‘I protest him!’”We are still sitting in the corner of our becalmed London bar. By this point, Pryce has turned a little wild-eyed. A woman sidles over and apologises for interrupting, but says she simply had to say hello. She says she is from his home town of Holywell in north Wales and adds: “Did you know there’s a big picture of you up in the local pub?”Pryce shakes his head distractedly. “You should go back and see it,” she says.It is funny, he confides, people tend to think he is Jewish. Even Mel Brooks, of all people, assumed that he was. In fact, he is a Celt, raised Presbyterian, the son of a miner who later ran a grocer’s shop. “But I left home when I was 18,” he shrugs. “I’ve got fond memories of home and I’ve got negative memories of home. I don’t really get back there as much as I should.”Some years back, he returned to Holywell for a school reunion. It was nice he met classmates he hadn’t seen in decades. “But I was thinking: ‘Oh my God, they all look really old. Thank God I don’t look like that.’ Then we did a group picture. And then they sent it to me.” He dissolves with laughter. “And in among all those old people was just another old person.”Our conversation has been a little choppy. All the same, I am pleased Pryce is finally being honoured by the Academy. By rights, he should have been nominated for Brazil, for Carrington or for his role as Glenn Close’s preening novelist husband in The Wife. I ask which of his roles he feels was unfairly overlooked, and he chuckles and says it is not a question he can answer. “It reminds me of the argument we’re having now about women who should have been nominated, or ethnic minorities who should have been nominated, when people forget that it’s a competition, it’s a ‘Who’s best?’ I mean, when I vote or when I look at a film, I don’t think: ‘Oh, it’s a woman director, therefore I’ll watch it in a different way.’ I’ll watch it as a film and judge it as that.”Hang on, I tell him, it is not as simple as that. He is assuming there exists an objective standard of excellence. The truth surely, is that our ideas of what is good and what is bad are conditioned by a whole bunch of factors: gender, ethnicity, class, what have you. If people are angered by this year’s Oscars, it is because they feel the Academy is not representative of cinema as a whole. If you broadened the voter base, you would get a richer spread of nominees.The actor winces. “Well, you can have that argument,” he says. “But it is rather patronising, the idea that if you get more African-Caribbean voters they’ll only vote for African-Caribbean films. And I’d only vote for Welsh films. Sometimes I can’t believe that we’re still having that argument. It’s only a fucking prize.”He reaches for his water he is practically spluttering. Yes, of course, he admits, people are herd-like and tribal. You can see it in politics, in society and in the film industry, too. People view the world – or the Oscar nominations – from their own particular vantage point. He gulps his drink and attempts a joke. He says: “I think there’s a definite shortage of 72-year-old Welsh men.”The Man Who Killed Don Quixote is released on 31 January.

The Manchester City manager says teams are currently overburdened by the hectic schedule and has pointed to the recent injuries picked up by Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford as evidence that the relentless workload during the season’s winter months is more than players can physically bear.Guardiola has won the League Cup in two of his three full seasons at City, and his side lead Manchester United 3-1 after the first leg of this year’s semi-final, yet he is of the opinion the competition does more harm than good.“Eliminate competitions, take out this competition,” he said when asked how to relieve fixture congestion over the festive period. “So less games, less competitions, less teams, more quality, less quantity. People can live without football for a while. It’s too much.“They want to do well. Clubs have a lot of pressure to win or qualify for the Champions League and we push and push. The body says stop, it’s enough.”Guardiola also defended Raheem Sterling, who is enduring a relative dry patch in front of goal after a prolific start to the season. “He has played more than 3,000 minutes,” he said. “His standards are continuing quite similar. Maybe he hasn’t scored in the last games but there are no doubts.”Guardiola’s side travel to Sheffield United on Tuesday night looking to make up ground on the leaders, Liverpool, before hosting Fulham in the FA Cup on Sunday – a fixture in which City hope to welcome back Aymeric Laporte from a long-term knee injury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f625f2635b93dc9344b43066920be25e4614b681/0_91_3976_2385/master/3976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccdae668c36e55709f93ae596074ca7f","title":"liverpool premier league title manchester united","story":"United have just been well beaten by a Liverpool side 30 points ahead of them. They are sleepwalking towards mediocrityLiverpool are brilliant. They are top of the league by 16 points with a game in hand and will probably have the title wrapped up by the end of March. And yet at the same time, while acknowledging how preposterous it is to offer any criticism of a side that has taken 64 points from 22 games this season, there must be a sense that of late they’ve become a little bit sloppy.In their past two league games, against Tottenham last week and then against Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday, they have come extremely close to drawing games they have dominated almost entirely. Giovani Lo Celso and Anthony Martial both missed extremely presentable chances to make it 1-1. In both games Liverpool ended up under pressure in the final 10 minutes – on Sunday at least until Mohamed Salah added a second on the break deep in injury time. Tottenham they had broadly held at arm’s length, in a performance of great control United they had pummelled for roughly a third of each half. And yet in each two points could have slipped from their grasp.Not that it really matters to Liverpool, of course, for anything other than the pursuit of records. At this stage their lead is unassailable and would be even if it were only 12 points. Perhaps that fallibility offers a note of caution before the Champions League knockouts, where a single goal carelessly conceded can have profound consequences. But actually the greater impact of the past two games may be for the losing sides. Those late rallies perhaps conjured the impression that all is not too far awry. But for United in particular, the gulf to Liverpool should be cause for major concern.This was 2-0 going on 5-1. Liverpool’s opening goal may have come slightly against the run of play but, in the 20 minutes that followed, United were overwhelmed. It was the same story in the 12 minutes of the second half from kick-off to Fred’s chance. In both spells Liverpool were quicker, sharper, stronger and cleverer. In both they could have scored two or three times without it seeming outrageous. There were goals ruled out for marginal decisions, the woodwork was struck and Salah somehow scuffed wide from eight yards with the whole goal at which to aim. Without being anything like the best football they have played this season, that was the level Liverpool can reach when they put their foot down – and it was a level high above United’s capacity.Injuries do not help, of course. United are without their two best central midfielders and their best forward. That would destabilise any side. But then Liverpool had been without their first-choice holding midfielder from the end of November until eight minutes from time on Sunday – and their response to that has been 11 clean sheets in 15 games (and two of the games when they conceded came within 24 hours of each other). Their first‑choice goalkeeper missed 11 games with a calf injury. Good teams with well-constructed squads overcome misfortune weaker ones wallow in it.Ole Gunnar Solskjær is becoming a master of discovering filaments of silver lining in the bleakest of clouds. If football management does not work out for him, a job in forensic pathology surely awaits. Here he talked of how well Fred had played, how committed United had been, how they had fought back after the barrage at the beginning of the second half. None of which was untrue – and Fred’s form over the past couple of months is arguably the brightest aspect of this season for United.But there is a bigger picture. This was not quite taking consolation from Manchester City having sufficient respect for United that they picked a strong team against them in the Carabao Cup but it was rhetoric of the mid‑table manager trying to draw positives from an entirely predictable defeat against a much better side.And that is where United stand – not in terms of resources or stadium or fanbase or cachet, of course, but in terms of form. They may lie fifth in the Premier League and the gap to fourth and implausible Champions League qualification may be only five points but from their 34 points from 23 games one can extrapolate that to 56 for the season. That would have been enough for fifth in 2003-04 but every other season in the past 20 years it would leave United seventh, eighth or ninth. It is eight points fewer than they got in their first post-Ferguson season, when David Moyes was sacked four games from the end of the season.There is an understandable willingness for Solskjær to succeed and the manager is not the only problem, perhaps not even the biggest problem, at Old Trafford. Patience, without question, is a rare virtue in football but it does not take much for the search for positives to become a hunt for excuses. United have just been well beaten by a Liverpool side 30 points ahead of them and the message seems to be that they should be grateful it was not worse. United are sleepwalking towards mediocrity: somebody, some time, is going to have to wake them up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8a7fbef157d6be5faa01d88a1b9fec7535d7646/0_0_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8f0bbb9e98195f5b2755e68ddab0222","title":"water worlds the magic of new south wales ocean pools","story":"We start on the southern edge of a small curved beach in the Clarence Valley.

Here are five of the contenders:As chief executive of Channel 4, Alex Mahon has experience of leading a public service broadcaster under pressure from the government.Mahon, the first woman to run a UK broadcaster larger than Channel 5, is currently overseeing the relocation of Channel 4’s operation out of London. She has said Britain’s public service broadcasters play a vital role in the “national conversation” that Silicon Valley players have no interest in.Charlotte Moore is the BBC director of content, responsible for a budget of more than £1bn. She has shown a willingness to stand up to the government in the past, defending the corporation’s “unashamedly popular” and distinctive television, and warning over future erosion of its independence.She has also taken a swipe at the BBC’s modern-day rivals, warning that Netflix and Amazon are motivated by profit rather than what is good for audiences.Gail Rebuck is the chair of Penguin Random House UK. She has worked in publishing for more than four decades and was formerly a member of the government’s creative industries taskforce.In 1998, she founded the World Book Day charity. Rebuck, who sits as a Labour peer in the House of Lords, has been linked with a top job at the BBC for decades.Jay Hunt was once considered a likely contender to be the first female director general, having held a series of senior jobs including director of programmes at Channel 5, controller of BBC One, and chief creative officer of Channel 4 – where she poached the Great British Bake Off.She had also been mentioned as a strong candidate to become chief executive of Channel 4 but missed out in 2017, with some claiming that her abrasive personality was a factor in the decision. Now overseeing European video at Apple, she may have moved into a different arena – but her experience in online content could make her an attractive candidate to the corporation.Sharon White was the former chief executive of Ofcom from 2015 until June last year when she was appointed chair of John Lewis. White has a background in economics, and before Ofcom worked as second permanent secretary to the Treasury where she was in charge of public finances.She has previously criticised the BBC for a lack of ersity and on leaving Ofcom said the broadcaster had “failed to come to terms” with external regulation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37b29f8665719a7bcd97bff51c41f54c42dabb2a/0_94_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dba510dcf2ed597b8ddfd3164dc8e56","title":"share your experiences of once in a lifetime jobs","story":"After hundreds apply to run a café on a remote Irish island, we’d like to hear about your one-of-a-kind job experiences Do you dream of quitting the rat race and moving to a remote island to run a B\u0026ampB, book shop or animal sanctuary?

It promised that by 2030, an extra two million people will be saving regularly, while two million fewer will be using credit cards for daily spending.It said plans to increase financial education in schools, extending it to 6.8 million children, up from 4.8 million at present. It also promised to offer an extra 300,000 people debt advice.But there will be little additional funding to meet the 2030 goals, with the government instead relying on partners such as Britain’s banks, utility companies and schools to help improve people’s sense of financial security.The pensions minister, Guy Opperman, said: “The government wants to make it easy for those who need it most to get help to make confident financial choices. The one-stop shop Money and Pensions Service’s free, high-quality, impartial information and guidance delivers exactly that.”But MaPS will face the same challenges as the former Money Advice Service, which in 2012 set out a similar strategy that promised to “provide advice to 11 million people each year … significantly increase practical money advice to 1.9 million people and ... equip a million people with personalised money action plans to help them take control of their money.”In 2016, the government abolished the Money Advice Service, amid concerns that the industry-funded body was squandering its £80m budget on advertising that produced few concrete results. It was later merged with the Pensions Advisory Service and Pension Wise to form MaPS.Sarah Porretta, the director of strategy at MaPS, said delivering the improvements by 2030 will involve existing partners, such as UK Finance, which acts on behalf of the banks, and new partners such as the utility companies and employers.She cited Timpson, the key cutting and shoe repair firm, which is trialling a new strategy entitled “sidecar savings” that it says could be rolled out to all employers.Administered by the government’s employer pension provider, Nest, Timpson’s payroll department deducts a certain amount each month from the worker’s pay. Part of the money goes into an emergency savings account, accessible immediately, and the rest into the pension pot. Once the emergency account reaches a certain level, sums are automatically rolled into the employee’s pension.MaPS is also interested in extending the “rentflex” system to avoid people having to use credit cards or payday loans to meet everyday bills. Rentflex allows social housing tenants to personalise their payments, reducing their rent at expensive times, such as Christmas, but increasing it at other times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dc4b282e063703a23aab5131ac94266978ba991/0_0_4565_3126/master/4565.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c1d97b6adc134db7408366fcba0fdf4 700w","title":"what are you planning to do to mark brexit day","story":"We would like to hear what you are doing at 11pm on 31 January to mark the UK leaving the EUFriday 31 January is Brexit’s point of no return: the end of the article 50 process, which cannot be reversed.

It was widely believed that Usdaw, one of the “big five” unions, was the most likely to give her its support. She and Emily Thornberry still have no nominations from constituency Labour parties (CLPs) or affiliated groups, leaving them with a difficult path to the next round.Responding to Usdaw’s decision to endorse him for the Labour leadership, Starmer said the party “will stand shoulder to shoulder with the trade union movement as we take on the Tories and rebuild trust with working people”.“I’m honoured to have received Usdaw’s endorsement for the Labour leadership,” he went on. He has also won support of 11 of the 14 CLPs to nominate so far.Rebecca Long-Bailey is seen as favourite to win the support of Unite and the Communication Workers Union and has already received the backing of the grassroots organisation Momentum.Sources from GMB believe that the Wigan MP Lisa Nandy may win the support of the union on Tuesday. Emily Thornberry appears to be struggling to secure union nominations.Monday’s decision at Usdaw’s central office in Manchester was made by the union’s 15-strong executive council.Paddy Lillis, Usdaw’s general secretary, said: “Usdaw believes that Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner are the right leadership team to unite and rebuild Labour after a devastating election loss. Our members desperately need Labour in power, they cannot afford another decade of Conservative governments attacking workers’ rights, incomes and public services.“The Labour party must be led by someone who can persuade voters that they have what it takes to be a prime minister and we are a government in waiting. That is at the heart of Usdaw’s decision to make these nominations.”GMB’s 50-strong executive will decide who they will back on Tuesday following a meeting and candidates’ hustings behind closed doors at the TUC’s headquarters. An announcement is expected at 4pm.Nandy has been in contact with the union’s general secretary, Tim Roache, and her campaign is run by the MP Louise Haigh, who is a firm favourite with the union.Starmer is still in the running for the GMB vote, sources said, because he is “a safe pair of hands”.Nandy’s campaign received a boost last week when the National Union of Mineworkers backed her as a candidate.The deadline has now passed for people to join Labour to vote in the leadership contest, which will end with the announcement of the winner on 4 April.Phillips, who has admitted in the  to an “awful” first hustings in Liverpool on Sunday, has today said the party must stop trying to appease “fearmongering opportunists” who sought to exploit immigration.Writing in the Independent, Phillips said Labour needed to challenge the “pernicious myth” that working-class communities were hostile to immigration. She said Labour needed to be clear that it did not believe the numbers coming to settle in the UK were too high."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/802d87f2f3de54447d9bafc7cb5bd625695c24c3/0_68_3414_2049/master/3414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da34c2567fe89763e3181327b1d60727","title":"business leaders urge government to publish aims for brexit deal","story":"The government must urgently publish its negotiating objectives for the next stage of Brexit talks, the Institute of Directors (IoD) has said, as it warned that business needs time to prepare for a new relationship with the EU by the end of the year.In a survey, the IoD found that directors are holding back on investment in business because of the continued uncertainty over Brexit.“To give businesses any chance of being ready for the new relationship by the end of 2020, the government needs to be as clear as possible about what its intended destination is,” Allie Renison, the IoD’s head of Europe and trade policy, said.“With directors clear that negotiations with the EU are the priority right now, clarity is crucial for so many companies.” The IoD found that while businesses welcomed the certainty given by the withdrawal agreement struck by the prime minister in October, it was not enough to unlock investment and planning decisions.The survey underlines the continued anxiety in the business sector over the future relationship with the EU.On Saturday Sajid Javid raised alarm bells when he warned that the UK would not be “aligned” with EU rules after the trade talks, sparking fears of trade barriers where none currently exist.Business leaders warned this could lead to unwelcome friction on cross-border trade with consequences for investment, jobs and the economy.The IoD is now pressing the government to publish its negotiating goals urgently.Brussels expects to publish draft negotiating guidelines on 1 February with its goals agreed among member states at a meeting on 25 February.The commission is currently holding a series of seminars in Brussels with member state representatives on its goals in areas including fisheries, energy, transport and law enforcement.The future mobility of EU citizens was discussed on Monday while space, the European defence fund, cyber security were the topics on Friday.The prime minister is expected to set out his hopes in a major speech in the first half of February but so far there has been little to no parallel consultation with business to mirror what is going on in Brussels.European commission spokesman Eric Mamer warned on Monday that it could be March before formal talks can begin. “We have said we will start negotiations as quickly as we can, but it will certainly not be before the end of February, beginning of March,” he said. “This is not a slowing down or speeding up of the process.“This is simply the nature of the institutional process and the consultations that need to take place before the negotiation directives can be formally adopted.”Renison added: “Avoiding the chaotic uncertainty of leaving the EU without a deal is clearly a relief to business leaders, but they are still much more inclined to feel this Brexit deal on its own doesn’t provide the certainty they need to invest and make plans for the future.“Only clarity on the next phase of Brexit talks on trade and the wider economic relationship with the EU will resolve that uncertainty, particularly for Northern Ireland and trade within the UK itself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10259fdfa4bc45aafd471954b831f86383f63400/0_275_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbb1d113a261430c240bccb85e351996","title":"low

study says those living in the poorest areas will be on average worse off.The thinktank says the economies of those areas with high numbers of disabled, unemployed or single-parent claimants – all groups likely to lose out under the new system – will see falls in spending power when universal credit is fully rolled out.Official data indicates that the deprived areas most closely matching this profile and where, on average, families will be worse off under universal credit, include places that unexpectedly voted for the government at the last election such as Blackpool, Middlesbrough, Redcar, Hyndburn and Wolverhampton.After its victory, the government promised to regenerate fragile post-industrial economies in the Midlands, the north and north-east of England where it won a swath of previously staunch Labour-voting parliamentary seats known as the “red wall”. Other areas where families are on average likely to be worse off when they move on to universal credit include Liverpool, Birmingham, Glasgow, Burnley, Kingston-upon-Hull, Blaenau Gwent, Knowsley and Hartlepool.Universal credit will pay out more than £60bn a year nationally by 2023. That many of the UK’s poorest local areas will be net average losers under universal credit is “something currently being ignored amid growing debates about how to level up economic outcomes across Britain”, says the foundation.Laura Gardiner, research director at Resolution, said some areas of the country would fare particularly badly under universal credit and understanding that “should be central to policy debates that are rightly focusing on what can be done to close economic gaps between parts of the UK”.The foundation also called for further changes to the design and generosity of universal credit to make the system easier for claimants to use and to ensure it meets its original aims of simplifying benefits, improving incentives to move into work and cutting poverty.“With the reputation of universal credit under significant threat, now is the time for the government and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to really understand how it is working on the ground in order to make necessary changes,” it says.While overall UK benefit spending will be maintained under universal credit, this masks a “substantial redistribution” of support between different areas of the country, says Resolution, with resources skewed towards families in high-rent areas like London and the south-east over the north and Midlands.With the return of a Tory government, the foundation concludes that universal credit, despite its turbulent history, is now “definitely going ahead”. Labour had promised a root-and-branch overhaul of what it had called a “cruel and inhuman” system. The foundation warns ministers against complacency, saying that universal credit remained a “negative symbol” of a decade of conservative welfare reform and that some of its central features – like the controversial minimum five-week wait for an initial payment – remained intensely disliked by claimants.Its qualitative research with claimants in Liverpool – supported financially by Liverpool city region – found that despite official insistence, there was no evidence that claimants believed that digitally administered benefits under universal credit were an improvement on the old system.Responding to the report, a DWP spokesperson said: “Universal credit supports more than 2.7 million people across every part of the country, introducing tailored support to replace a complicated old system. This report rightly recognises improvements we’ve made, like boosting work allowances for some families to £1,000 and making it much easier to apply online.”Universal credit, which rolls six working-age benefits into a single monthly payment, was initially due to be fully rolled out in 2017, but a series of blunders means it will not be completed until at least 2023, by which time approximately 6 million families will have been signed up.Ministers originally argued the new system would reduce poverty by improving incentives for people to work. But Gardiner said the “jury was still out” on this as wider benefit cuts such as the benefit freeze and the two-child limit, which apply to people on universal credit, were likely to push up poverty rates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538b4c32ba83e8eed0983f676db4a9d821c4ccb9/182_133_2568_1541/master/2568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df394501b6812e51b1e7b289f13b9d5d","title":"jessica judd ukad mo farah samples","story":"The British athlete Jessica Judd has warned athletics “is dying a drug‑fuelled death” as the row over whether UK Anti-Doping should hand over Mo Farah’s blood and urine samples to the World Anti-Doping Agency for retesting rumbles on.Judd, who represented Britain over 5,000m at the 2019 world championships in Doha, tweeted that she was embarrassed by the Ukad chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, saying she would not hand over Farah’s samples to a Wada investigation into the Nike Oregon Project without “credible evidence” they contained banned substances.Farah’s former coach Alberto Salazar was banned for four years for doping offences in October, but none of his athletes were banned. Farah has always denied any wrongdoing. He has also not publicly commented on this dispute.Sapstead says handing over the blood and urine of Britain’s four‑times Olympic champion would risk degrading samples that are stored for up to 10 years so they can be retested using new detection methods. Judd said she had nothing to hide and would be willing for Wada to retest any of her samples. “I disagree with Ukad as their actions are tainting everyone with the same tarred brush,” she later added.Russia has accused Ukad of creating a “wall of mistrust” over UK Anti‑Doping and its athletes because of its reluctance to release Farah’s samples. Margarita Pakhnotskaya, the Russian Anti‑Doping Agency deputy general director, told Tass: “The World Anti-Doping Code and Wada standards are the same for everyone. Be it the British Anti-Doping Agency, Rusada or some other. Otherwise the system will not work. Therefore, I believe that Ukad should not obstruct any transfer of samples.“According to paragraph 6.5 of the Wada Code, the subsequent additional analysis of doping samples can be carried out at any time solely on the instructions of the anti-doping organisation or on the instructions of Wada. Any opacity on either side, and this is not just about Ukad, creates a wall of mistrust in the country’s anti-doping system and, accordingly, its athletes as part of the system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5b12add0c877d0ed1054b28955306ebee0ef7f/0_89_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=496ed2a3ae8ad4417a568f89859d5537","title":"saracens way nigel wray gold relegation","story":"From the Champions League to Test cricket to Team GB: where money flows, success often follows. But as a country we don’t really like to talk about thatIn September and October last year, with what we now have to say is slightly unfortunate timing, Saracens issued a series of short videos to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of “The Saracens Way”, the cultural transformation that is said to have turned them into one of the most irresistible forces in the history of English club rugby union.“The Saracens Way, quite simply, is the club,” Will Fraser beams into the camera. A former flanker who retired through injury, Fraser now sells Brand Saracens to a bulging catalogue of corporate clients. For a competitive day rate, including lunch and refreshments, Fraser and a current Saracens player or coach will instil in your company the cornerstones of the Saracens winning ethos: cultural change, strong values, an emphasis on happiness and making memories. “If we create good people,” Fraser explains, “we create good rugby players.”Of course, it was not just fund managers, insurance giants and private schools prepared to invest wholesale in the promise of their own Saracens-liveried epiphany. To read back some of the more reverential media coverage the club received during its glory years, knowing what we do now, is to be reminded of the way dominant sports teams are often accorded a fantastical quasi-shamanic quality, their every trait sanctified, their every twitch scoured for valuable learnings that might benefit the rest of us.The secret of Saracens’ success? It was the creche at the training ground, allowing players to work in a family-oriented environment. It was the microphones attached to players at training to improve communication. It was the team-building holidays to Budapest and Munich. It was the philosophy round tables where the club psychologist would initiate discussions of Descartes. It was the wolves that the then-defensive coach Paul Gustard brought to a team meeting to illustrate the club’s “pack” mentality.The Saracens Way was sold to us as an ideology, almost a lifestyle: a triumph of culture and values, of innovation and fresh thinking. For journalists and corporate bookers it held an instant, sticky appeal: Imagineer Your Way To Success With This One Weird Trick! For some of the sport’s more supercilious fans, seeing the likes of Brad Barritt and Owen Farrell taking on business degrees provided a handy contrast with those thick, vulgar round-ballers. And yet perhaps there was another lesson to be learned from Saracens, one that can really be appreciated only now the club have been found guilty of persistent salary-cap breaches and are facing relegation and ignominy as a result.It was telling, after all, how few of the treatments of Saracens’ unprecedented era of success mentioned its position as one of the Premiership’s financially dominant clubs. Underwritten for more than two decades by the multi-millionaire Nigel Wray and his family, who have absorbed immense debts in order to drive investment in the club’s infrastructure and academy, Saracens have enjoyed a long-term stability that most other clubs have not.Throw in almost £50m of written-off loans and the good fortune of a huge, affluent catchment area in north London, Hertfordshire and Essex, and perhaps you will understand why Saracens’ rivals are less than impressed by the news they have broken the salary cap in each of the previous three seasons and are scheduled to do so again this season by – according to some reports – more than £2m.This was the real One Weird Trick: not quite as widely discussed, perhaps, and a little less sexy than wolves and Descartes, but perhaps the single most crucial factor in those four Premiership titles and three European Champions Cups. None of which, of course, is to play down the graft and ingenuity of the club’s players or coaches, or the very decent work its foundation has done across north London, or the success of its talent pipeline, or the shambolic handling of the case by Premiership Rugby. All of these can be true at once: rugby’s governance structures are scarcely fit for purpose wealth is not the only determinant of sporting success other clubs may well have broken the rules over the years some of the biggest victims of this transgression will be the club’s own players and fans Saracens financially doped their way to success.There are parallels, perhaps, with the trials of Team Sky, that other feelgood British success story whose massive budget, lack of transparency and casual attitude towards sporting ethics were elided by an unquestioning media and a wider lack of curiosity. And to this day Saracens retain a small deranged core of press cheerleaders who regard their crimes as little more than a form-filling oversight, ignoring the potential for even a small overspend to distort the market: a marginal gain, if you like, but one that offers a decisive edge on your rivals.From the Champions League to Test cricket to Team GB: where money flows success often follows. But as a country we don’t really like to talk about that. We don’t like to talk about the ways in which financial clout can tilt the playing field, stockpile talent, buy political influence and favourable media coverage, hire batteries of lawyers to deter legislation and squash competitors.Instead we would rather talk about winning mentalities and virtuous cultures, about creches and team-building jaunts. To do otherwise, after all, would be to tear down the illusion that still props up the narrative of sport in this country: that through talent, hard work and innovation alone, you too can stand atop the podium. It is a maxim that has never been true in society and is rarely – if ever – true in sport. Anyone telling you different is probably trying to sell you something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d19c9a7466ae9b06d5fcd0628401e58049bbfb/0_48_3104_1863/master/3104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24d6256903aa225bb85e46f193ab48a2","title":"johanna konta bundled out of australian open by ons jabeur","story":"Johanna Konta, delayed by rain on day one, was hurried out of the 2020 Australian Open on day two when the Tunisian world No 78, Ons Jabeur, dominated the British No 1 almost from start to finish to win 6-4 6-2 in just over an hour.Konta, still troubled by a long-term knee injury, had to save an early break point, and was on the back foot for most of the first set as Jabeur moved impressively into her groundstrokes, hitting deep and wide.She fashioned her break with style in the 10th game, grabbing set point with a blistering forehand return off a limp second serve, and hitting an almost identical shot from open play. After 37 minutes, there wasn’t much in the contest, statistically – the Tunisian outscoring the 12th seed by five points, with both landing their first serves consistently – but, psychologically, Konta now had to regroup to stay in the first slam of the year.Behind in the serving cycle, Konta had the added pressure of staying in touch on the scoreboard and desperately needed an early break to take Jabeur out of her comfort zone. Instead she had to cope with dropping her serve in the fourth game. Her situation had gone from tough to grim in the space of a few minutes.When Jabeur held for 4-1, Konta needed to find something special. She continued to go for winners, but there was desperation rather than conviction in her tennis.After 22 minutes of a difficult second set, Konta served to stay in the championship. Jabeur charged the net and the lob in reply drifted long. Two points from going out, Konta served up a dolly second serve and Jabeur smashed a brilliant crosscourt return for match point. Konta’s final effort, a cramped backhand on the line, went long and the suffering was done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aae5b9d340aa9fb1ce4a50bd8c8b8f806cb067e6/150_654_1403_842/master/1403.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb513e56f7350669b2e77a1a46c8323c","title":"toby jones uncle vanya harold pinter theatre london","story":"He’s played everything from an elf in Harry Potter to Truman Capote and a harassed coach driver. Now, Jones is taking on Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya. Just don’t call it the role of a lifetimeTwenty minutes after we meet, I worry that I’ve given Toby Jones some kind of existential crisis. “Why are people so interested in what performers have to say?” he exclaims, genuine angst etched on to his face. “Actors talking about acting has to be has to be one of the most appalling things to read. I mean, it makes you scream!”He swivels on his chair, gazing towards the window and into the night beyond. “It’s just … well, it’s not something you can … sort of really describe,” he adds, turning back towards me and looking at me with his big, boyish eyes.Blimey. All I’d asked is what drew him to acting in the first place. But, if he’s worried about taking himself too seriously – if it all feels a little, well, inexplicable – you can perhaps understand why. Fifteen years ago, nearing 40, Jones looked like just another employed but jobbing thesp: an elf in Harry Potter here, TV “character” parts there, some BBC radio drama.An Olivier award for best supporting actor in The Play What I Wrote got him noticed, but didn’t appear to transform his career. Jones’s chances of making it to the big time seemed exemplified by the fact that he was cast as Julia Roberts’s stalker in Notting Hill, only to find out afterwards that he’d been axed from the edit. (Ever the pro, Jones turned the yarn into an Edinburgh show, Missing Reel, which became a radio play.)Then everything changed. A pitch-perfect turn as Truman Capote in the 2006 docudrama Infamous stole the show from Daniel Craig and Sandra Bullock, and the bit parts and voiceovers transmogrified into meaty roles. Jones’s gift for impersonation (Hitchcock, Karl Rove) proved invaluable he seemed able to dip his toe into superhero franchises such as Captain America without losing his arthouse cool, or his theatre chops. Suddenly, Toby Jones was everywhere.The man himself doesn’t quite see it that way. “It’s really way more chaotic than that,” he sighs, ruffling his hair. “It’s not like you feel you’ve arrived, that you can get any part you want with anyone you want, that there’s loads of money and it’ll be fun all the time.” He brightens. “But I kind of like the fact that there is no ladder. I want to keep moving.”We meet after Jones has spent the day rehearsing for Uncle Vanya – his third collaboration with director Ian Rickson, and a return to the theatre where the pair did Pinter’s The Birthday Party in 2018. In Conor McPherson’s plain-spoken, down-to-earth adaptation, Chekhov’s script is cleaned of fustiness and affectation. Vanya himself, stuck managing a rural estate while his domineering brother-in-law gets sleek on the proceeds, is forever scraping food off his clothes and fumbling for the vodka.Given Jones’s eye for oddballs and outcasts, Vanya must seem like the part of a lifetime, I suggest. “It’s on the very, very short list of roles I’ve really wanted. It was the first Chekhov I read, it was the first Chekhov I saw. But I’m hesitant to say it’s the role of a lifetime, because that cuts off my supply of future roles.”Rickson says that Jones “manages to get this deep feeling without sentiment, the sense of existential crisis but also tremendous longing. He’s sublime.”There’s so much going on with Vanya – loneliness, envy, self-hatred, craving for acceptance, and a painful crush on his brother-in-law’s glamorous new wife. Some have compared the character to Hamlet in middle age. What does Jones think drives him? “Always in Chekhov, it’s the need to be heard. The need to matter, to be registered, to be seen. There’s an element of classic midlife crisis, but there’s also something really profound.”Lest this all sound too doomy, he adds that they’re eager to play up the comedy of the piece, too: “It’s the kind of comedy where you walk into a lamp-post, but still.”Born in London before his family moved to Oxford, Jones comes from thespian stock. His father, Freddie, who died last summer, played the thunderous freak-show owner Bytes in David Lynch’s The Elephant Man and became a much-loved fixture on Emmerdale. His mother Jennie’s own acting lineage stretches back several generations. Nonetheless, even after studying drama in Manchester, Jones wavered about whether to pursue it as a career, wary of entering the family firm, along with the perennial anxiety that it was all a bit self-indulgent.Then came a spell at Lecoq school in Paris, which transformed his outlook. “It teaches you to learn – to watch, you know, to see patterns and rhythms in the world,” he says. With its emphasis on physical training and movement, it’s not hard to see Lecoq everywhere in Jones’s subsequent roles: that near-microscopic obsession with voice and mannerism and poise, the determination to get the shading of a character just so.Though his appearances on stage have been limited in the last decade, these traits were evident in his bewildered, almost beatific turn as Stanley in the Birthday Party, as well as a harrumphing, cockneyfied JMW Turner in Rebecca Lenkiewicz’s The Painter in 2011. Last autumn, he popped up in the ensemble for Caryl Churchill’s Glass. Kill. Bluebird. Imp., offering an affable yet sinister performance in the longest of the pieces – a reminder how subtle he can be as a live performer.Jones says that, after years in which he’s done five or six screen projects, it’s a relief to be back in theatres again, and spend proper time getting inside a script. “The thing I enjoy most is rehearsing a play,” he says. “Getting into the characters, asking why people behave the way they do.”I’m struck by his workload, which even by his standards seems a little intense: I count 50 films in the last 20-odd years, plus half as many TV shows and series. Is he ever not working? He seems genuinely flummoxed by the question. “I, um – well, I don’t know what to … It doesn’t feel like work. Other actors say, ‘Oh, are you going to take a holiday?’ But our work isn’t really like that, at least for me. There is a kind of release in your work. I don’t need a holiday from acting.”Thinking about it again a moment later, he admits it might be something he’s inherited from his dad, who was doing Emmerdale until the year before his death at 91, and left claiming that he wanted to pursue other projects. “He was an extraordinary guy. And he remained remarkably open until a very old age. It’s an enviable thing to have as an old man, to remain that impressed by the world.”Was his father proud of him? “You know, he said, ‘It’s nothing to do with me.’ He wasn’t uncomplimentary or anything like that, but he just saw me as my own person. That’s a fantastic thing.”I overhear that one of his teenage daughters is attending the run-through of Vanya the day after we meet – will the Jones acting dynasty extend into the future? He laughs. “I honestly don’t know. They’ve seen a lot of theatre. But they’re not saying that at the moment.”Family is a kind of anchor, you sense: he and his wife Karen, a criminal barrister, have been together since college, and he’s done his utmost to finagle his work schedule so that he can spend as much time as possible at home in south London. “I’ve learned a lot about how to manage things from my wife. She’s much busier than I am.”I’m intrigued by a recent crossover project, Don’t Forget the Driver, a TV collaboration with the maverick theatre-maker Tim Crouch, his first writing for the screen. The pair have known each other for decades, since their days at the National Theatre Studio, and have co-written the script Jones stars as a long-suffering coach driver with a clip-on tie and a hangdog look. The show has recently been renewed for a second series, and will be returning to BBC Two later in the year.“It’s pure pleasure,” Jones says – the chance to write for a change, as well as the chance to delve into a pleasurably unglamorous aspect of contemporary Britain. Difficult though acting can be to talk about, that’s the thing he loves, he says – the sheer range of it. Coach drivers one week, Chekhov the next.“You know, I’m in a business that has Mark Rylance and Leonardo DiCaprio as well as Phillip Schofield, Simon McBurney and Tim Crouch in it.” He laughs. “I mean, these people are my people.”• Uncle Vanya is at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, until 2 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/915dce9a84ef4121b5b18d1dda758df838c8a925/218_31_2548_1529/master/2548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6ead2182ff94838a5519153dd3905a1","title":"us case against huaweis meng wanzhou is fiction say lawyers","story":"Extradition hearing begins in Canada as defence team rejects allegations that executive tried to get around Iran sanctionsThe accusations of sanctions busting against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou have been dismissed by her lawyers as “fiction” at the start of a legal hearing in Canada in which she is fighting extradition to the United States.Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the technology conglomerate, and eldest daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei, is wanted by US authorities for alleged fraud in trying to circumvent Washington’s sanctions against Iran.She made no comment as she rushed past protesters waving “Free Meng” and “Trump stop bullying us” placards outside the special court in Vanouver on Monday.Inside, she sat following the proceedings with the help of an interpreter as her attorneys used their opening remarks to reject the fraud charges against her on the basis that her alleged conduct was not illegal at the time in Canada.Her defense lawyer, Richard Peck, told the court that the central issue was “double criminality”, the legal concept that Meng’s extradition to the US requires that her alleged actions also be considered a crime in Canada.“Would we be here in the absence of U.S. sanctions law, and ... our response is no,” Peck said. “In a typical case, double criminality is not contentious. This case, however, is founded on an allegation of breach of US sanctions, sanctions which Canada has expressly repudiated,” he added.In order to secure her freedom, Meng must convince Judge Heather Holmes that the US charges would not stand up in Canada and are politically motivated.The US alleges Meng lied to HSBC bank about Huawei’s relationship with its Iran-based affiliate Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Tehran.Meng has denied the allegations in a case that has severely strained China-Canada relations. She has been out on bail, living in one of her two Vancouver mansions for the past year.Lawyers for Canada’s attorney general, on behalf of the US justice department, will justify extradition by arguing that the US accusations against Meng would be considered a crime in Canada if they had occurred in the country.“This case is founded on allegations of breach of US sanctions, which Canada has repudiated,” he said, adding that Canada was effectively being asked “to enforce US sanctions.”He also argued that HSBC would not be prosecuted in Canada for unwittingly breaking the sanctions and so Meng’s actions caused no harm under its fraud definition.Earlier, China’s foreign ministry called Meng’s extradition case a “grave political incident” and urged Ottawa to release the Huawei executive in order to normalize relations.Canada’s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, responded that Ottawa “honours its extradition treaty commitments” and would not interfere in the case.In a statement, Huawei said that it trusted Canada’s judicial system and believed Meng will be found innocent.Meng’s arrest during a stopover of a Hong Kong-to-Mexico flight in December 2018 put the 47-year-old at the centre of the US and China’s battle over the technology giant’s growing global reach.It also stuck Canada in the middle of a trade row between the world’s two largest economies, resulting in China restricting agricultural imports from Canada."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72bdd746be82e37042a4683d3048623033c26e15/0_115_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0a218a8bd10a0873f90f4a5be315efe","title":"make the most of loyalty cards and nine other spending tips for spontaneous lifestyles","story":"It’s not easy to save at the best of times – and it’s even tougher if you’re prone to some last-minute spending. None of us want to miss out on that party invite or weekend away. Now you won’t have toYou’ve heard it a million times: the secret to staying on budget is to plan ahead. But, for many of us, that’s easier said than done. We work so hard that we don’t have time to organise things far in advance, nor are we able to devote as much energy to our finances as we should. But, also, it’s simply a lot of fun to be spontaneous and make the most of opportunities that come up.For that reason, it isn’t always easy to stick rigidly to a budget. Last-minute expenses, invitations for weekends away, or celebrations with friends and family can often come up unexpectedly. But if you’re canny with it, you can be spontaneous without going overboard. So here are 10 smart ways to spend that even the busiest person can stick to.Eat out smartWhen a friend suggests lunch or an evening meal on the town that you hadn’t planned for, you don’t have to miss out. Using restaurant-booking websites, you can find restaurants near to you that have special offers such as free prosecco, two- or three-course meals, or afternoon tea at reduced rates.Get rewarded for spendingOne great way to earn back some of your spending money is to use a cashback credit card. If you choose one that doesn’t have a limit on the amount of cashback you could earn – such as the American Express Platinum Cashback Everyday Credit Card – you’ll be paid back a proportion of your spending as cashback. The more you spend, the greater the reward, meaning that if you use your credit card for everyday spending as well as big-ticket items, you can reap the rewards in cashback. (See Important information panel.)Set aside extra cash each month for last-minute social commitments If you know you’re liable to go big on going out, or you regularly need to find extra cash for last-minute social occasions, add a contingency to your budget so you don’t end up short at the end of the month. If you don’t use it one month, you can carry it forward towards a bigger item later. Make sure you’ve set aside enough to cover all your regular and necessary expenses such as rent or mortgage and utility bills before you calculate your spending money.Buy an annual passSome museum and gallery exhibitions charge a comparatively high fee for a one-off ticket, but offer annual passes for the cost of two or three visits. These memberships often also include free guest or child passes, so if it is somewhere you’ll visit regularly, you can save a lot of money over the course of a year. Ask whether they have an introductory rate for new members.Use an appThere are lots of money apps you can use to alert you if your spending is higher than you’d like. Different apps provide different services, from providing smart insights on your spending and showing an overview of your finances, to alerting you to where you could reduce unnecessary expenses. Be specific with your needs when you look for the app for you, and always read customer reviews to see how others have benefitted.Make the most of retailers’ loyalty cardsMany stores and supermarkets give points on shopping that can be used as part payment in-store or exchanged for vouchers and money off. Often, the deals available are more generous than the face value of the points if you decide to convert them into meal vouchers or money off on days out.Enjoy the big screenThere are plenty of ways to go to the cinema for less. Some have deals on certain days and secret blockbuster screenings at reduced rates. Afternoon showings and Sunday mornings are often cheaper, too.Get your culture on the cheapIf the theatre is more your thing, you can turn up at the box office a few hours before a performance and ask for reduced seats. Some websites list popular shows for £25 per person or less. Many theatres set aside a number of cheaper tickets for under-25s, over-60s and students of all ages, too. Be flexible about your thrillsWhile many theme parks and attractions offer the cheapest price for advance tickets, some online bookings are valid for three months to a year from the date of purchase. So if you fancy an adrenaline rush, or a fun day out for the kids, you can pre-book and then decide later when you want to go. It’s particularly useful if you want to combine your trip with a favourable weather forecast.Last-minute getawaysWhether it’s a holiday cottage by the sea, a winter sojourn in the sun, or a weekend city break, leaving it to the last minute to book can bag you a bargain. Lots of travel sites use dynamic pricing, which means that what you pay will change in response to supply and demand. If you are flexible enough to have your suitcase packed and ready to head off within 24 hours, you can snap up some incredible deals.

But it still can’t deliver the goodsWith a flashy, showgirl name like Diamond Dealers and Cockney Geezers (Channel 4) this one-off documentary was always going to be a bit of frivolous fun. Trotters, on Bethnal Green Road in east London, is a small independent jewellery shop that likes to think big. The business was founded by Judd Green’s father in 1991, and passed down to his son, who now runs the shop with his best friends from school, Kallum and Alex. This rapid-fire hour, narrated by Dani Dyer, is an attempt to showcase the trio’s cheeky chappy charm as much as it is about the art of selling spectacularly expensive watches and chains.Trotters has a big following on Instagram, and a customer base all over the UK, with people making the trip to Bethnal Green from as far afield as Bradford, much to the amusement of Dyer’s voiceover. Their patrons haggle and often pay in cash, and the shop is certainly a lively kind of place. While recent documentaries about pet food and chocolate factories seemed little more than glorified ads, this at least tries to get to the heart of what makes Trotters tick. Judd, Kallum and Alex are keen to make the point that the people shopping with them are people like them. “We get a lot more working-class than we do posh people,” explains Judd.We see a lot of the customers who come through, each showing off their own form of British eccentricity. There’s Grizz, referred to euphemistically as a “local amateur horticulturalist”, who wants his sparkly union jack pendant to be “iced up” before he takes a trip to California to explore the cannabis industry there. There’s a lot of double-speak here, and though I was desperate to know more about the people who appeared, it never scratched much more than the surface. Ashley and Ashley, a couple from Essex, popped in so male Ashley could buy female Ashley a diamond crucifix. “We had a little breakup a few weeks ago,” explains male Ashley. “Had to butter her up a little bit.” When female Ashley reappears a few weeks later, all that butter has melted away (demonstrating the true cost of a relationship when she cannot get the full cost of the make-up necklace refunded).The best customer is Charlotte, who comes to look at angel-wing pendants. Now, perhaps the arrival of a very eccentric customer when cameras were in the shop was a coincidence let’s not be cynical. Charlotte turns out to be a psychic and clairvoyant who can read the tarot. Naturally, she offers to show off her skills, and by reading Alex’s palms she deduces that he is a bit anaemic, and has irritable bowel syndrome. Even if they did bus her in for a bit of drama, it was delightful, and possibly the most English of psychic consultations that has ever taken place: “Tell me what the future holds.” “You’ll have a dicky tummy if you keep eating pastry.”As a film, though, this can’t contain the big characters within it, and never sufficiently trusts that the “nowt so queer as folk” approach will sustain it, even though it would. Instead, it falls back on contrivances (if it is one) like the psychic. They also pop up to Sheffield to meet the boxer Charlie Edwards, who has just FaceTimed them, to chat about a special commission, and do little to improve north-south relations when they say it’s “like going back in time” and “proper Billy Elliot” as they drive into the city. There’s a semi-tortured explanation given for a quick trip to New York that seems to take place just so Dyer gets to say: “From the East End to the east coast.” They’re there, I think, to look at the kind of watch worn by DJ Khaled in an Instagram video, called “the chandelier”, a blinding piece of bling, literally it’s so shiny it should come with a warning to never look directly at it. They go for dinner in an empty restaurant with the rapper Casanova 2X, who thinks the watch is over the top, so they don’t bring one home with them. End of the New York segment. That’s it. We get the setup, but nothing delivers. It leaves you with the post-junk food feeling, like you’ve eaten, and you’re sort of full, but you’re also nowhere near satisfied.Actually, the boys do decide to get a chandelier made in the end, but they order it from Hong Kong, and the rest of the episode is concerned with whether they can shift a watch for £120,000 or not. Spoiler alert: everyone thinks a watch that costs more than four times the average annual UK salary is a bit too showy. Like the wares Trotter is peddling, this documentary is flashy and never understated, but unlike the contents of the shop, it has little to offer in the way of value."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5a78520d3dc454d3a5755ebee5e0b8a6508c044/674_278_1684_1010/master/1684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb886973cb282cc7be151b63b2ae0b71","title":"how we made captain planet and the planeteers","story":"‘Never in our wildest dreams did we think our over-the-top storylines about floods and food shortages would come true’In 1980, America’s Global 2000 Report to the President took the current trends of the planet – population pressures, overstretched resources – and projected them 20 years into the future. It read like armageddon. CNN founder Ted Turner handed me the report as my job description. I wasn’t a film-maker – I began as a photojournalist for NBC, capturing social issues in 70s New York – but he preferred that I learned to make films than for him to find another producer who understood the environmental crisis we were facing.Ted called me into his office and said: “Captain Planet.” “What’s that, sir?” I asked. He said: “That’s your problem.” And my problem it was.We lifted the characters and locations from environmental documentaries I had made with Nick Boxer. The Planeteers and many of the characters were based on real people. The world didn’t need another male macho superhero, so we made Captain Planet the quintessential antihero. He can’t exist without the combined powers of the Planeteers. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, called them together when the degradation of the planet became too dire for her to bear.Each Planeteer controls a power of nature: earth, wind, fire, water – and heart. Heart is the most important power, as without it there can be no compassion. Captain Planet himself is a metaphor for international cooperation, with a penchant for bad puns and 60s music. Not unlike the UN.Never in our wildest dreams did we think our over-the-top storylines would come true. In one episode, Planeteer Wheeler renounces his powers and visits a future where flooding and food shortages are the new normal. We set it in 2025, but it is already happening.The show became a global phenomenon: people recognised their countries and their neighbours. The merchandising was hard for me to stomach, but business does what business does. Captain Planet’s image was prohibited on single-use products. The action figures were made from plastic scrap and only recycled paper was used.Our goal was to arm a generation with the knowledge to find more sustainable ways of living on the planet. The millennials are living proof that it worked. These adult Planeteers are growing into positions of power, bringing their knowledge to bear to make the changes we need. This work is critical, because today, it’s as if the show’s eco-villains have come to life. Opposing them are legions of inspired people worldwide, marching to combat the climate crisis. However, we are almost at the point of no return. The fate of our species – and all living things – is now truly in our hands.I’d been acting professionally since I was 13, and had a voiceover career by the time of the show’s audition. They asked me to perform a scene where Captain Planet gets washed clean of toxic goo. I made a “dog shake” sound before I said my line, and got the gig.I later discovered I’d replaced Tom Cruise, who had already recorded the first five episodes. Everyone on the voice cast was grateful to be associated with the project, and worked for minimum wage. This seemed amazing to me given some of the A-listers I recorded with: Jeff Goldblum, Meg Ryan, Malcolm McDowell … Whoopi Goldberg, who voiced Gaia, brought in her Oscar (best supporting actress for Ghost) for us to play with.It’s fun to play a bad guy, and I enjoyed giving Captain Pollution – Captain Planet’s evil clone – a valley accent. This wasn’t a swipe at Bill and Ted, or Snake from The Simpsons: it was just the voice that, in the early 90s, represented total irresponsibility. There was one scene where MAL, the evil computer voiced by Tim Curry, gloated about pollution causing stronger storms and melting the Greenlandic ice sheet. The show was very prophetic in many ways, and it’s alarming that the knowledge that fed into it has been ignored for so long. But I do think the conversation is changing now. Younger people are becoming more vocal and doing the job that we adults have neglected. I wrote to Greta Thunberg recently: if she’s reading this, Captain Planet would love to help out.When production ended, I wrote to Al Gore, inspired by his documentary An Inconvenient Truth. I’d dreamed of seeing environmentalism incorporated into the school curriculum. Children are the only demographic on the planet who aren’t motivated by profit.I was in New Zealand once for a commercial shoot, and encountered an environmental rally. Somebody had a Planeteers poster over his head, so I asked him how he knew the show. “Everyone knows Captain Planet, mate!” came the reply. I introduced myself – I had to prove I was for real by reciting my catchphrase, “The power is yours!” – and suddenly found myself on stage addressing 3,500 people while still dressed for the gym.• The Captain Planet Foundation is currently hosting Project Learning Garden 2020.

It’s either a baffling vanity project – or an instant classicTo watch Cooking with Paris, Paris Hilton’s new foray into the world of online culinary demonstration, is to ask yourself one thing over and over again: is Paris Hilton a genius?Because, over the course of this 15-minute YouTube video, Paris Hilton cooks a lasagne. That’s all she does. And a lasagne is one of the easiest things in the world to cook. It would be impossible to make the act of lasagne assembly look even slightly entertaining if this were Jamie or Nigella. But impossible means nothing to a woman like Paris Hilton. Her lasagne preparation method, you see, is almost indescribable.Sashaying into her kitchen holding a little dog dressed as a French maid, Paris greets us by saying: “As you all know – well, maybe not all of you know – people who do know know that I’m an amazing cook.” It’s a 21-word sentence and the first 17 are entirely redundant. All she needed to say was “I’m an amazing cook.”And she is. So long as you remember that ‘amazing’ doesn’t mean ‘good’, or even ‘enthusiastic’. At the very first hurdle – preparing the lasagne sheets – Paris realises she’s been supplied with ones that need to be boiled, and she complains. She shows us all the ricotta she’ll be using, then tells us not to use as much as her. She realises that her mozzarella doesn’t come pre-grated, and sighs with such deep resignation you think she might be about to jack the whole thing in. “This is so brutal” she complains, before discarding an almost untouched block of cheese for fear that the grater will destroy her fingers.She takes a photograph of her ingredients and tweets it, instructing us in no uncertain terms never to use the hashtag #Parislasagne when referring to her. She doesn’t know what ricotta looks like. She holds up a spatula and says “I don’t know what this is”. Spoons, she declares, are “brutal”. She wets kitchen roll with bottled water. She does something with salt that I won’t tell you for fear that I’ll be chased out of town as a liar.Even from a cleanliness perspective, Cooking with Paris is incredible. For instance, she favours gloves in the kitchen – but not just any glove. She prefers the sort of fingerless mittens that weightlifters use, claiming that they’re usually used for sliving, which I am almost entirely convinced is not a word, and wears them while her untied, waist-length hair swishes dangerously close to every single ingredient she touches.But here’s the thing: I have no idea if Cooking with Paris is a joke or not. It looks like it is probably a vanity project by a dangerously out-of-touch rich lady. But at the same time it’s too diligent not to be. Every time an opportunity for stupidity arises – literally every single time – Paris Hilton manages to rise up and hit the target. A genuine idiot wouldn’t make this much of a hash of a lasagne, but this is basically a Mr Bean video. Trained scientists could parse Cooking with Paris for traces of self-awareness and come up none the wiser.It’s all so baffling. Who is this video for? Why was it made? What does Paris Hilton hope to achieve with it? Why did she call her dog Diamond Baby? Why does she make such a big deal about all the slogan tea towels she owns? What, in the holy name of the lord above, is sliving?I do not know. All I know is that I got inordinately excited when Paris Hilton ended the video by telling us that this would not be a one-off and asked what she should cook next.

The rules will be debated and voted on when senators convene for the trial on Tuesday.Under McConnell’s plan, the opening arguments from the House prosecutors would be limited to 24 hours over two days, meaning that senators could face two 12-hour days to start the trial proceedings. Trump’s legal team was given the same time to present its case.Senators would then be allowed up to 16 hours for questions to the prosecution and defence, followed by four hours of debate. Only then will there be votes on calling other witnesses.The rules also allow for a Senate vote on bypassing hearing the House case altogether, although many believe such a vote is unlikely.Democrats, who demanded votes on witnesses to be held straight away, branded McConnell’s proposals a “national disgrace”.McConnell has been angling for a speedy trial toward acquittal of the charges against the president, and the closely-held rules package arrived late on Monday after Trump’s legal team asserted that he did nothing wrong, urging the Senate to swiftly reject what they called the flimsy and rigged impeachment case against him.With Republicans holding the Senate majority, McConnell’s proposal is likely to be approved by senators in the president’s party.The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, called the GOP leader’s proposals a national disgrace.“It’s clear Senator McConnell is hell-bent on making it much more difficult to get witnesses and documents and intent on rushing the trial through,” Schumer said. He vowed to propose votes to try to amend the package.In the event that senators agree to call witnesses, the rules propose that any witness must be deposed, in which they give sworn, out-of-court testimony, and the Senate would then decide which ones, if any, would testify in public.At the end of deliberations, the Senate would vote on each impeachment article.The White House welcomed the proposal for a speedy trial.“We are gratified that the draft resolution protects the president’s rights to a fair trial, and look forward to presenting a vigorous defense on the facts and the process as quickly as possible, and seeking an acquittal as swiftly as possible,” said White House legislative affairs director, Eric Ueland.“All of this is a dangerous perversion of the constitution that the Senate should swiftly and roundly condemn,” the lawyers wrote. The articles should be rejected and the president should immediately be acquitted.In their filing on Monday, House prosecutors issued fresh demands for a fair trial in the Senate: “Trump asserts that his impeachment is a partisan hoax. He is wrong,” the prosecutors wrote.The House Democrats led by Adam Schiff, chair of the intelligence committee, said the president could not have it both ways – rejecting the facts of the House case but also stonewalling congressional subpoenas for witnesses and testimony. “Senators must honour their own oaths by holding a fair trial with all relevant evidence,” they wrote.The White House document released on Monday said the two articles of impeachment brought against the president abuse of power and obstruction of Congress do not amount to impeachable offences. It asserted that the impeachment inquiry, centered on Trump’s request that Ukraine’s president open an investigation into Democratic rival Joe Biden, was never about finding the truth.The impeachment case accuses Trump of abusing power by withholding military aid from Ukraine at the same time that he was seeking an investigation into Biden, and of obstructing Congress by instructing administration officials not to appear for testimony or provide documents, defying congressional subpoenas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6c15e933c4fe98a20d0b6f8ba1d9ae799786b15/0_389_4916_2950/master/4916.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=906c1810bb1dcdd7609c0fdcf45ca571","title":"angola use all possible means force return isabel dos santos luanda leaks","story":"Pledge comes as former ruler’s daughter denounces Luanda Leaks investigationThe Angolan government has vowed to use “all possible means” to force the return of Isabel dos Santos following the Luanda Leaks investigation into how the ex-president’s daughter accrued her $2bn fortune.Angola’s prosecutor general, Hélder Pitra Grós, said on Angolan public radio on Monday that the country would use “all possible means and activate international mechanisms to bring Dos Santos back to the country”.Dos Santos left Angola in 2018 after her father stepped down as president. She has denied any wrongdoing.In a string of tweets after the  and partners revealed the story behind her fortune on Sunday, she denounced the Luanda Leaks investigation – based on 715,000 files from her business empire – claiming it was part of a concerted campaign by the Angolan government to discredit her.“The ICIJ report is based on many fake documents and false information, it is a coordinated political attack in coordinations with the ‘Angolan Government’. 715 thousand documents read? Who believes that? #icij #lies,” she tweeted, referring to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, of which the  is a partner.Dos Santos says her wealth is the result of hard work and business acumen rather than state funds. “I build companies and enterprises, I invest and create jobs. This where my wealth comes from: BUSINESSES,” she tweeted last night.”At the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London on Monday, attended by 21 African countries, a member of the Angolan delegation denied Dos Santos’s descriptions of the government’s actions as a “witch-hunt”.The Luanda Leaks project is based on a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts detailing the business operations of Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president of Angola.The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).The documents, which cover a period between 1980 and 2018, have been reviewed by more than 120 journalists from 37 media outlets, including the , the BBC and the Portuguese newspaper\u0026nbspExpresso.António Henriques da Silva, the president of the board of Aipex, Angola’s investment agency, said: “There is a clear separation of judicial and executive powers. We are reaching a point where people are sensitive towards transparency and good governance and equal rights.”Da Silva said investors wanted to see the country was tackling practices that could be perceived as unethical.“This is a person who took advantage of her position,” he alleged of Dos Santos. “If the money was invested in the population, in people who do not have access to education or health in Angola, it could save lives.”In December an Angolan court froze Dos Santos’s assets, accusing her of having benefitted from preferential state deals under her father’s government.Last week she lost a defamation case in Portugal against Ana Gomes, an MEP who had accused her of money laundering on Twitter. The court found Gomes’s right to freedom of speech outweighed Dos Santos’s right to protect her reputation.On Friday the Portuguese newspaper Expresso reported that authorities in Monaco were investigating her and her father for money laundering, citing an Angolan official in contact with Interpol. Both she and her father, José Eduardo dos Santos, have denied money laundering.Anti-corruption and financial transparency experts said the case highlighted the role of professional services firms, such as accountants and consultants, in enabling high-risk behaviour. The UK government has identified so-called professional enablers as a law enforcement priority.“Don’t let anyone frame #LuandaLeaks as a story of ‘corruption’ in a poor country – just like #ParadisePapers and all the rest, this is ultimately about failures of international rules, and the corrupting influence of professional enablers,” said Alex Cobham, the chief executive of the Tax Justice Network.Susan Hawley, executive director of the campaign group Spotlight on Corruption, said it was “essential that the UK authorities act urgently” to identify Dos Santos’s UK assets in anticipation of any possible request for assistance from Angolan law enforcement.They said they were unable to comment on the existence or otherwise of any investigation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4b655d21bf33073746d8969ebd09998f00cc8d6/0_70_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=670d410dc6bda39d609d4d2ac13727d4","title":"coronavirus spreads to beijing as china confirms new cases","story":"Authorities on alert ahead of lunar new year holiday as 139 new cases of strain detectedChina’s health ministry has confirmed human-to-human transmission of a mysterious Sars-like virus that has spread across the country and fuelled anxiety about the prospect of a major outbreak as millions begin travelling for lunar new year celebrations.Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the national health commission team investigating the outbreak, confirmed that two cases of infection in China’s Guangdong province had been caused by human-to-human transmission and medical staff had been infected, China’s official Xinhua news agency said on Monday.Authorities earlier reported 139 new cases of the new strain of coronavirus over the weekend, bringing the total number of infected patients to 217 since the virus was first detected last month in the central city of Wuhan.It was also confirmed on Tuesday that an 89-year-old man had died from the virus in Wuhan, bringing the number of fatalities to four.Cases were confirmed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong province in the south, heightening fears ahead of the lunar new year holiday, when more than 400 million people are expected to travel domestically and internationally.State broadcaster CCTV said on Monday evening there were seven suspected cases in other parts of the country, including Shandong in the east, and the south-western provinces of Sichuan, Guangxi and Yunnan. Five people who travelled from Wuhan were also being treated for fevers in Zhejiang province.“People’s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed,” said China’s president, Xi Jinping, weighing in on the matter for the first time.The strain has caused alarm because of its connection to severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03. The current outbreak has spread to Thailand, Japan and South Korea.A man was in isolation in Brisbane, Australia after being suspected of having the virus after he returned from a visit to Wuhan. China’s National Health Commission said it had sent working groups to all provinces to oversee outbreak prevention, describing the situation as “controllable”. Hospitals in Shanghai and Beijing and in Zhejiang province have “comprehensively” strengthened examination procedures. In Shenzhen, temperature checks have been put in place in airports, ports and railway stations.More than 100 patients with symptoms were waiting to be seen at the Xiehe hospital in Wuhan at 6am on Monday. “If you are coming now, you have to wait between three and four hours before you can see the doctors,” a hospital worker said by phone.At a hospital in Chaoyang district in Beijing, patients were being given masks and forms to fill out, detailing any recent travel to Wuhan. A nurse said preventive measures were also being taken to protect doctorsCoronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people, and the outbreak in Wuhan has been linked to a now-closed seafood market where live animals were reportedly sold.The World Health Organization has said an animal source was “the most likely primary source” of the outbreak, with “some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts”. Researchers worry the number of infections has been severely underestimated.The WHO said it would convene an emergency meeting in Geneva on Wednesday to discuss whether the new coronavirus constituted an international health emergency.Xi Chen, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said the likelihood of human-to-human transmission had appeared large given how many cases were confirmed. “It’s hard to see all these cases coming from animals at the same market,” Chen said.For weeks, the only reported cases were in Wuhan and areas outside mainland China, prompting many people to question whether other cities were simply not reporting or testing for the virus. Some internet users joked the virus appeared to be “patriotic” by only spreading beyond China’s borders.Chen said the high cost of testing for diagnosis may have contributed to underreporting. Authorities have still not identified the source of the infection, which further complicates the government’s ability to contain the outbreak. The Huanan seafood market, where thousands of traders sold products, has been closed since 1 January. But some of the detected cases are patients with no history of visiting the market.“What concerns me is the source of infection. We have no idea. That’s the most important thing. Without knowing that we don’t know the harm, how hard it can be,” Chen said.Others fear that authorities have not moved quickly enough to contain the spread of the virus or educate the public. In Wuhan, temperature checkpoints have been installed at the airport and at train stations and bus terminals since 14 January, about five weeks after the virus was first detected.Observers and residents worry about the possibility of a cover-up worsening the outbreak, as was the case with Sars in 2003.Some residents in Wuhan have been told not to speak to media. The official Weibo account of Wuhan police said on 1 January that eight internet users who spread false information online “causing adverse social impacts” had been dealt with “according to the law”.But Chinese health officials have made improvements since the Sars episode. In response to a bird flu outbreak in 2013, authorities quickly worked with the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fresh food markets were shut down but the outbreak was exacerbated by poultry sales into smaller, less-regulated markets.The situation is complicated by the fact that farmers are unlikely to be compensated by the government or give up their sick animals. “It’s not about a cover-up. Rather it’s about a lack of capacity and about a lack of enforced regulation,” said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor focusing on health security at City University of Hong Kong.“At the moment, it is a bad flu. Yes, it is something to be concerned about and it is probably going to get worse in terms of infections and mortality, but again it’s winter,” he said. “It is likely to spread but we are still a long way off the levels of Sars or bird flu.”The state-run Global Times said in an editorial on Sunday: “In the early days of Sars, there was a cover-up and delayed reporting. Such things can never be repeated again in China.”Authorities have advised residents in the run-up to the lunar new year, which falls on 25 January, to be on the lookout for symptoms including fever, coughs, breathing difficulties and pneumonia. Millions of people will crisscross the country during a weeklong public holiday starting on 24 January, in what is known as humanity’s largest migration. Some of those travelling will have set off already.The WHO has not recommended any travel restrictions and Chinese authorities have not yet issued any. Still, not all residents were comforted by government assurances.“With this huge amount of spring festival travel, why are there not any prevention measures?” one wrote on Weibo. On the Douban forum, another observed that few people at Wuhan train station were wearing masks. Traders at the now-closed suspected seafood market in Wuhan said they were not overly worried, seeing the virus as little more than the common cold. “We start early, at 2am or 3am. We put our hands in the cold water. If we catch a cold, we don’t pay it much attention,” said Li, 52, who has operated a stall in Huanan for most of the past decade.Li said that starting from late December, the property developer that owned the market asked renters to wear masks to work and avoid going to crowded places. “I’m not worried,” said Li. “My grandchildren all live in Wuhan and we don’t believe it. It’s just rumours.”However, Li said some tenants who might have shown symptoms of the virus were unlikely to have reported themselves, fearing the impact on their business and being quarantined. “Most people wouldn’t say if they had it,” he said.Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e10976f8b34a0660419dec4596e62de967e1f4c/121_684_5098_3058/master/5098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2c224996920bb157c00e0a31ed4d6fa","title":"coronavirus virus spreading through china should people be worried","story":"Experts fear latest strain of virus may spread across planet from person to person It is a novel coronavirus – that is to say, a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. Many of those infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. Antiviral drugs may be used, but usually only lessen the severity of symptoms. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get breathing support as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s National Health Commission in two cases of infection in Guangdong province, although it does not appear to be happening easily as was the case with Sars. As of 20 January the Chinese authorities had acknowledged 139 cases, double the number previously reported, and three deaths. Modelling carried out by Imperial College experts has suggested there may be more than 1,700 cases. Those that are mild may not be detected at all.There are fears that the coronavirus may spread more widely and person to person during the Chinese new year holidays at the end of this month, when millions of people travel home to celebrate. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and anxious that the virus will become more potent than so far appears."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Election 2020: \u0026lsquoIreland is like a beautiful modern building on crumbling Victorian foundations\u0026rsquoPlans by hotelier Martin Keane for the site are declared invalid\u0026lsquoThe State built 8,500 social houses in 1975, but was able to build only 750 two years ago\u0026rsquoGroup seeks free contraception, universal pension system and support for lone parentsGreens set to make gains, Labour struggling while Independents on course to lose seatsTrade union movement accuses Doherty of being imprudent on self-employedEddie Mulligan\u0026rsquos running mate says \u0026lsquoonus\u0026rsquo is on all Fianna F\u0026aacuteil candidates to notify party about any financial difficultiesLeendert Stolk pleaded guilty to 22 sample counts of wrongfully claiming social welfareSimon Harris claims party wants to introduce free dental care for those under 16, and a baby box for every newborn childTributes paid to Stephen Martin who has served in North\u0026rsquos police force for 34 yearsRevised policy agreed by the Executive includes measures to improve transparency and accountabilityVandals throw brick through window of Fine Gael Senator\u0026rsquos office in Blackpool, Co CorkDr Pawel Kaminski was before Medical Council over care provided to patientUnion warns industrial action will resume if significant progress not made in new processPeers back amendment to give EU nationals proof of right to stay in UK after BrexitMining company said it is the same crown hole that appeared in August"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4145722.1579540658!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ni assembly votes to reject brexit withdrawal deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Stormont official watches proceedings in the Northern Ireland Assembly Chamber on a television in the Great Hall at Stormont Buildings. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireThe North’s Assembly has voted overwhelmingly to reject the British government’s Brexit withdrawal deal.MLAs had been asked by the UK’s Brexit Secretary to give legislative consent to the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill, which lays out the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU on January 31st.In a vote on Monday, a clear majority of members voted in favour of the motion affirming that the Assembly “does not agree to give its consent” to the Bill. There were no audible dissenters.The decision by Northern Ireland’s MLAs will not affect the UK’s departure from the EU at the end of the month.“This Assembly has not given its consent to the British government to legislate on our behalf,” said the deputy first minister, Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill.The parties, she said, “must work together in common cause to overcome the challenges that have been opposed upon us by Brexit.“It’s significant that this Assembly sends a very firm message again that we reject Brexit, that we follow after Scotland has rejected Brexit, and I believe Wales will vote tomorrow to maybe also reject Brexit,” she said.In Edinburgh earlier this month, the Scottish parliament voted to reject the Bill by 92 votes to 29. The Welsh first minister has urged assembly members in Wales to vote against it.‘Disappointment’The Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, has written to Scottish and Welsh ministers expressing his “disappointment” that the devolved governments have not given their support to the Bill.He said that while the British government should “not normally” press ahead with such legislation without the consent of the devolved administrations, the circumstances of the UK’s departure from the EU are “specific, singular and exceptional”.While in this case the British government would proceed without their consent, Mr Barclay said, it would “continue to work to address your concerns”.During the three-hour debate which preceded the vote, each of the North’s five main political parties spoke in support of the motion.Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU by 56 per cent to 44. Four of the five parties were pro-Remain. The DUP, which was pro-Leave, opposes the Withdrawal Agreement Bill over fears it will create a border down the Irish Sea.Northern Ireland’s first minister\u0026nbspArlene Foster called on the British prime minister Boris Johnson to “deliver on his promise” of unfettered access to markets in Great Britain.The withdrawal deal, the DUP leader said, posed “significant challenges for Northern Ireland” and MLAs should “take a stand” to show that the Assembly is “back in business”.‘No appetite’“So the prime minister has described his withdrawal agreement as oven ready,” he said, “but it’s “very clear from this chamber and from business and stakeholders that there’s no appetite for the current withdrawal agreement.”The SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon said that the debate was an opportunity to “give the people of Northern Ireland a voice. Today we must send a united message to Boris Johnson in the UK government, to Dublin and to Brussels that collectively we reject the EU withdrawal agreement,” she said.Ms Mallon called on the British government to “immediately rule out any future threat of a no deal Brexit.” It was not Mr Johnson or his Cabinet colleagues who would “suffer as a result of this dangerous cliff edge” she said. “It will be communities, farmers and businesses right across Northern Ireland.“People at home are rightly concerned,” she said. “They know, given the catalogue of experiences to date, that the words of the prime minister Boris Johnson cannot be trusted.”Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong, said that while her party opposed to Brexit, it accepted it was now “inevitable” and the focus should be “on taking the rough edges off the Brexit deal - standing up and protecting Northern Ireland.”“Rather than what could have been a foot in both camps for Northern Ireland, unless protections are put in place, we may well end up being marginal in both the UK and EU arrangements,” she said.The Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken called for a number of “practical measures”, including the “rapid creation of the Brexit subcommittee”, to mitigate the potential impact of Brexit.“There’s little appetite in the EU, in London, in Dublin to deliver what is best for us here in Northern Ireland,” he said. “The only way we can make these changes, the only way we can influence this is if we all join together and make this happen.” – Additional reporting PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The funeral was held at the Holy Trinity church in Whitestone, New York. Photograph: Lauren CrothersMcSorley’s Old Ale House, opened by Irish immigrant John McSorley in 1854, is the oldest Irish pub in New York, where sawdust on the floor provides a comforting crunch underfoot and walls are decked with mementos of yesteryear.The chair Abraham Lincoln is alleged to have sat on looks down over the bar, along with dusty fire helmets and the turkey wishbones eaten by men who never returned from war.This week, however, the mood in the popular East Village haunt in Manhattan is sombre, following the passing of its beloved long-time owner, Kilkenny-born Matty Maher, who was buried on Wednesday.His funeral on a bright, crisp morning on Wednesday was attended by hundreds of family and friends. His casket was escorted by two pipers from the New York fire department, and carried under an arch of hurleys.Mr Maher’s daughter, Andrea spoke of a man who loved “laughter, stories and song”.“Nothing ever held him down. He saw good in any situation,” she said.Paying tribute, Fr Tom Brosnan said tombstones usually have a hyphen between the deceased’s dates of birth and death: “Matty’s hyphen should be very long not because of the years he lived, but because of the things he accomplished in those years.”Mr Maher’s move to New York and eventual ownership of the bar was serendipitous, following a chance meeting in 1964 when he was just 25 with its then-owner, Harry Kirwan after Kirwan’s car broke down during a holiday in Ireland.The young Maher came to his aid, and the older publican promised the young Kilkenny man a job should he ever find himself in New York. Mr Kirwan was true to his word.Stepping into those shoes years later, one of Mr Maher’s greatest gifts was in knowing “all the regulars”, who included second World War veterans, but also in remembering people he’d only met once.Recalling his employer, the pub’s longest-serving barman, Jeff Bartholomew, hired by Mr Maher in 1972 when the latter was the manager, said: “He ran the taps. He was the nexus for the whole place.“He was one of those guys you’d really want to be in a foxhole with. He could see what was going on and he knew what was going on,” Mr Bartholomew, said on Tuesday before leaving for his old boss’s wake.‘Traditional Irish publican’Remembering one of Mr Maher’s final visits to the pub, fellow bartender and family relative, Shane Buggy said he had been “a true, traditional Irish publican” right to the end.Encountering a group he had not seen for 15 years, the elderly landlord “walked over to the bar, got a fistful of ale and just dropped it down and said, ‘Welcome back, lads.’ He was always like that. His generosity knew no bounds.”His passing shocked family and friends, said Buggy, remembering his last meeting with him a week ago, where his boss left him parting advice.“Ah you’re doing a great job down there, lads, keep it going,” Mr Maher had said. “Keep those doors open and keep the fire lit and you’ll have a crowd there this afternoon.”In its own message on Facebook, McSorley’s said: “When he started working at the bar, McSorley’s was still a men-only establishment with dozens of flophouses within blocks from 15 East 7th Street. When they had to let women in by court order on August 11th, 1970, the bar’s future was uncertain.“And when Matty purchased the place in 1977, the city was near bankrupt and the neighbourhood’s future uncertain. Landlords were just walking away from their buildings, heroin was rampant, cars had to wait in lines that extended for blocks just to get gas, crime, and grime everywhere.“But Matty left poverty back in Ireland and he was determined to leave it behind for good. He saw an opportunity and believed in the American Dream. And he loved history and all things Irish and knew McSorley’s and the city could survive when so many others told him he was absolutely nuts.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4145957.1579559467!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 ff edges ahead of fg as sf surges in new ipsos mrbi poll","story":"Fianna Fáil enjoys a small lead over Fine Gael following a sharp drop in support for the Government party in recent months, according to the first Ipsos MRBI opinion poll of the general election campaign.With 19 days to go before the election takes place, Fianna Fáil has taken the lead over its main rival for the first time in three years, while Sinn Féin also performs very strongly in the poll.The Green Party is also set to make gains, while Independents and smaller parties are on course to lose several Dáil seats.The poll was taken on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of last week in the days after the election campaign began. The survey was conducted face to face among 1,200 adults at 120 locations in every constituency. The accuracy level is estimated at plus or minus 2.8 per cent.Excluding undecided voters and those unlikely to vote, 25 per cent of respondents said they would vote for Fianna Fáil (no change), 23 per cent for Fine Gael (down six), 21 per cent for Sinn Féin (up seven), 5 per cent for Labour (down one), 8 per cent for the Green Party (no change) and 18 per cent for Independents and small parties (no change). The comparison is with the most recent Ipsos MRBI poll last October.Margin of errorAmong the Independents and smaller parties, the breakdown shows a number of groups all within the margin of error of each other.Solidarity-People Before Profit are at 2 per cent (up one), the Social Democrats are at 2 per cent (up one), Independents4Change are at 1 per cent (down one), the Independent Alliance are at less than 1 per cent (no change), non-party Independents are on 10 per cent (no change) and other groups and parties are on 3 per cent (up one).While Fine Gael will be relieved to be only marginally behind Fianna Fáil after a difficult opening week to the campaign (and a poll over the weekend showing a 12-point lead for Fianna Fáil), there are other danger signs for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in the numbers.The 23 per cent achieved by the party today is its lowest level of support since before the last election, and if repeated on election day would result in significant seat losses.In addition, satisfaction with the Government has dropped sharply from 42 per cent in October to 27 per cent today, while Mr Varadkar’s personal approval rating has plummeted from 51 per cent in October to 35 per cent today.Micheál Martin’s personal approval ratings have also fallen, from 38 per cent to 33 per cent, while Labour’s Brendan Howlin falls from 20 per cent to 17 per cent. Only Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald sees her personal rating rise, from 30 per cent to 34 per cent.Seven-point jumpAnd it is Sinn Féin that will be happiest with the findings of the poll, following a substantial seven-point jump in support since October. The recovery in Sinn Féin support comes in all regions but it is still at its weakest in Dublin, where it is in fourth place (at 14 per cent).However, Sinn Féin optimism will be tempered by the knowledge that the party has previously tended to underperform its opinion poll numbers when it comes to election day.The Green Party looks to be on course for seat gains on the numbers, and is particularly strong in Dublin, where it is in third place at 15 per cent. The Labour Party faces a fierce struggle to gain new seats.A fifth of voters (20 per cent) told the pollsters they were undecided. When they are included, the “core” vote of the parties is as follows: Fianna Fáil 20 per cent (no change) Fine Gael 18 per cent (down four) Sinn Féin 17 per cent (up five) Greens 6 per cent (no change) Labour 4 per cent (down one) and Independentsothers 15 per cent (no change).MethodologyThis survey in the Republic of Ireland was conducted exclusively on behalf of the  by Ipsos MRBI, among a national quota sample of 1,200 representative of the c.3.6m adults aged 18 upwards, covering 120 sampling points throughout all constituencies in the Republic of Ireland.Since February 2016, a question on voting importance has been included. All respondents are asked how much their vote counts on a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 means it “makes no difference” and 10 means it “makes all the difference”. Those answering 1 to this question are treated as non-voters and are excluded from our party preference calculation, along with those who don’t know how they will vote or say they will not vote.Extracts from the report may be quoted or published on condition that due acknowledgement is given to The  and Ipsos MRBI.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4145269.1579516519!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu citizens want physical card to prove right to stay in uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over digital evidence  of their rights. File photograph: Will OlivierEPAThe British government is facing fresh calls to issue EU citizens with a physical document to prove they have the right to stay in the country after Brexit.A report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over the digital evidence they have now to demonstrate their rights in future to employers, banks or landlords.Fears over discrimination, loss of identity and a continuing lack of trust in the government’s willingness to deliver guaranteed lifetime rights emerged as serious concerns in the research – the biggest survey of EU, European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss citizens in the UK to date.Tanja Bueltmann, a professor at Northumbria University who designed and conducted the poll along with the campaign group the3million, said: “The survey documents, without question, we have an ‘unsettling status’.“This extends beyond the application process, revealing an erosion of trust an erosion of wellbeing and an erosion of the sense of belonging among survey respondents.“The government has a duty to finally give EUEEA and Swiss citizens certainty. Hollow words are not enough.”The findings came just days after the government gave the European parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, reassurances that EU citizens would not be automatically deported if they failed to apply for the settled status scheme.The survey, published on Monday, found that nine in 10 of those polled were unhappy about the lack of a physical document to demonstrate their right to remain in the country after they had been granted settled status or pre-settled status.As many as 11 per cent said they had already been asked for settled status proof, even though this is not legally required.This echoes a warning by private landlords that tenants could face discrimination because of the lack of a physical document.On the plus side, many of those surveyed reported a positive experience of the settled status app, with a majority of respondents saying the application process worked well.As many as 97.1 per cent of the 3,171 valid responses to the survey said they had received the status decision they expected.However, the emotional response to having to apply and the consequences of being labelled as someone with “settled status” was largely adverse. The words most frequently used by respondents to describe their feelings were “angry”, “anxious” and “unwanted”.Even those who had already been granted settled status felt worse off, with 80 per cent either strongly agreeing or agreeing that they felt anxious.Eight out of 10 said the process made them stressed and many thought citizenship was far more secure.Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million, said the report underlined the lack of trust after three years of mixed messages.“Are we the much-quoted ‘neighbours, colleagues, friends’ or are we the ‘queue jumpers, benefits scroungers, unwelcome guests, draining the NHS’?“The government needs to step up local outreach and support, both to EUEEA and Swiss citizens but also to employers, landlords and others who will be forced to check the immigration status of these citizens in order to avoid huge fines.”The British Home Office said the scheme was working and a digital solution was better than a physical document. “This digital status future-proofs their rights and is linked to their passport or ID card, replacing physical documents which can get lost, stolen, damaged, tampered with and expire,” it said.–Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

In October 1995, as chief executive of BBC News, he told John Birt, the then Director General, that Diana, Princess of Wales, was about to record an interview with Panorama in which she would reveal that there were “three people” in her marriage.The problem was the BBC’s chairman, Marmaduke Hussey. His wife Lady Susan was – and still is – lady-in-waiting to the Queen. So together, Hall and Birt contrived to keep the story a secret from him.On Monday, after his sudden resignation, Hall himself was at the centre of the shock headlines. For while the Corporation was braced for storms in the run-up to its 2022 licence fee negotiation with an unsympathetic government, few had expected him to fall – or be pushed – onto his sword so soon.He was, after all, the perfect candidate, the Janus-faced DG able both to look upwards to the BBC’s paymasters in government, and benevolently down upon the Corporation’s more than 22,400 staff. Able to soothe and charm, network and politic in the corridors of power and come away with £3.7 billion a year in funding, while simultaneously relying on a BBC lifer’s reputation to lead a hesitant institution into an era of streaming, on-demand, subscription service competition, where rivals had their own billions and, in the internet, a means of delivering them.Not that Hall was unused to revitalising an organisation criticised for being wasteful and out of touch on the public dime. A decade in charge of the Royal Opera House, to which he had fled after being beaten to the top job at the BBC in 2001 by Greg Dyke, was an unlikely yet perfect preparation for the task he would face on his return to rescue the broadcaster as it listed in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal – a disaster which proved too much for then DG George Entwistle to survive.Today, the crisis facing Lord Hall does not seem quite so lethal. But it is certainly toxic. In the last few weeks, focus has fallen once again on the amount of money the BBC pays its stars. This time it is not because of the annual salaries paid at various times to Gary Lineker (£1.75 million) or Jeremy Vine (£700,000) or John Humphrys (£600,000) but because of the high-profile cases of female colleagues paid nothing like the same.As the BBC scrambles to compensate women such as Vine’s colleague Samira Ahmed, or Humphrys’ former co-presenter on Today, Sarah Montague, with payouts in the hundreds of thousands, some four million pensioners across the land are due to start receiving demands that they pay the licence fee. Only those on pension credit benefit will be exempt.A political storm is in the making. And while it was eminently survivable for Hall, it is symbolic of a dilemma at the heart of the BBC that he has, for all his astute operating, failed or been unable to address: universality.Hall is proud of his response to the Netflix challenge. The BBC iPlayer is stable, used by millions, and has the potential to become a fully-fledged streaming platform, with programmes available long term, rather than just a catch-up service for those who have missed shows.The BBC Sounds app operates as a similar driver of audiences to the BBC’s radio and podcast output. And Britbox is a subscription service (launched last year with ITV) that has shown some success even in America – home of the on-demand revolution – attracting more than half a million subscribers there.As for content, Hall came in determined to focus the BBC on what it does best – drama and nature documentaries, for example. And from War and Peace to Bodyguard, to the latest hi-definition David Attenborough extravaganza, he feels he has delivered. But the key question endures: What exactly is the BBC meant to be? And if the answer is “all things to all people”, then how, in an age of specialised, big-budget rivals, does it avoid the comparative mediocrity, which will be a faster route to its demise than any technological or political difficulty.It may, for example, be about to start the compulsory billing of pensioners for its services, yet overwhelmingly it feels the need to spend that money on the young – on the 16 to 35-year-olds whom it has repeatedly been criticised by Ofcom for not appealing enough to. No doubt as a result, the BBC news website now runs not just news but a constant diet of features, celebrity gossip and what is known in the business as “clickbait” – stories of dubious journalistic value which attract audiences with often bizarre, animal-themed headlines, such as last week’s effort: “My boyfriend dumped me but how do I tell my cat?”In this generational paradox lies the heart of its programming paradox: the fear of becoming irrelevant to some compels the BBC to become more like its rivals. But the only case for its existence and funding mechanism is that it becomes less so. That it is distinctive. That it does not, for example, tweet out spurious nonsense during an election campaign because its rivals do so.It is getting universality all wrong. Indeed, the only area where the BBC indubitably is narrow – in its London-dominated metropolitan news coverage – has been exposed by the recent election as a handicap, eroding its reputation and authority at a time when both are critical. The question for Hall’s successor, then, is how to retain and reimagine the universal mission and yet be distinctive.Some suggest the answer could include a hybrid model: a core model funded by a reduced licence fee supplemented by paid-for add-ons. Imagine a Proms season in which the First and Last Nights are accessible to all, but for which a ticket to all other concerts, in HD, might cost £25.In news, distinctiveness could and probably should mean leveraging the BBC’s network of regional journalists not just to report, but to shape editorial decisions. And combining that with greater analytical heft – particularly online.The way to attract and retain younger audiences, some concerned friends of the Corporation say, is not to commission madcap Saturday night tosh, or engage in pointless efforts to draw them to Radio 3 documentaries, or online clickbait, but to deliver the same distinctive, analytical, regional, quality content, in forms that suit them. The medium may change, the message should not.Universality for the BBC must not be about doing everything badly. It must be about retaining its reputation for quality and trust, so that it remains, in a fragmented media world, the only place where the nation may still come together – to watch Strictly, or the World Cup.Tony Hall knew that and started the job. Completing it proved beyond him. But his successor needs to harness the BBC’s unique resources to be as good as its rivals yet very different to them – or risk losing its privileges forever.     The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Sources said Lord Hall believes the appointee will be sympathetic to the Tory view.It is understood that the BBC board also wanted a new face to lead the corporation as it fights for survival ahead of Charter Renewal in 2027. Lord Hall’s position has been weakened in recent months by accusations of political bias in the BBC’s reporting, and by his failure to get to grips with an equal pay scandal that shows no sign of abating. The Samira Ahmed case has opened the floodgates for women at the corporation to claim millions in back pay.“Tony decided some months ago that he was going to go. The one thing that has triggered it is a new chairman coming next year,” a source said.Reacting to news of Lord Hall\u0027s departure, Nicky Morgan, the Culture Secretary,  said: Thanks to Tony Hall for the service he has given to the BBC, including the last seven years as director-general.He\u0027s made a huge contribution to public service broadcasting in his career. In this ever changing broadcast landscape the next director-general will need to build on Lord Hall\u0027s success.June Sarpong, recently appointed as the BBC\u0027s first director of creative ersity, tweeted: It has been my great pleasure and honour to work under the visionary leadership of Tony Hall, I cannot overstate the support he has shown me in helping to start the process of inclusive change at the BBC. He will be sincerely missed.Lord Hall\u0026#039s message to all BBC staffThe  understands that the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport are mulling over several names to replace Sir David.Ministers have been visiting other broadcasters and have been impressed by the efficient way they are run with a comparatively small number of staff. One Conservative source said they wanted to see the BBC learn from commercial rivals about how to cut the costs of programme-making.Lord Hall took over as director-general in 2013 in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. His predecessor, George Entwistle, had lasted just 54 days.In 2015, Lord Hall agreed that the BBC would bear the cost of free television licences for the over-75s, insisting at the time that it was a “strong” deal. But last year he announced that more than three million pensioners will have their free licences rescinded.The BBC insisted it could not afford the £745m annual cost of the free licences, and will save nearly £500 million by charging all over-75s except those who claim pension credit.Those pleas of poverty sit awkwardly with revelations about BBC over-spending on star salaries. Samira Ahmed’s recent employment tribunal highlighted the fact that Jeremy Vine was paid £3,000 per 15-minute episode of Points of View.This week Sarah Montague disclosed that she had won £400,000 in back pay after forcing bosses to concede that she had been significantly underpaid in comparison to her male colleagues on Today.One former BBC governor said Lord Hall had to go: “He has not handled the equal pay issue at all well. He simply didn’t get ahead of it and see what would follow. That’s quite a major failing. Most of all, his handling of the licence fee deal for over-75s was lamentable.”Friends of the director-general said he had achieved a great deal during his seven years in the job, and equal pay was a problem he inherited. “Tony spent a lot of his time cleaning up other people’s mistakes,” one said.Lord Hall, who was chief executive of the Royal Opera House before becoming director-general, now plans a return to the arts. His first appointment was announced Monday, as chairman of the trustees at the National Gallery.In his resignation speech to BBC staff, he said: “If I followed my heart I would genuinely never want to leave. However, I believe that an important part of leadership is putting the interests of the organisation first.”Lord Hall - the 16th Director-General of the BBC - was born the son of a bank manager in Birkenhead, Cheshire, in 1951.He was educated at King Edward\u0027s School, Birmingham and Birkenhead School, before studying at Keble College, Oxford, where he read philosophy, politics and economics.Lord Hall joined the BBC as a trainee in 1973, working first in its Belfast newsroom before becoming a producer on Today, The World At One and PM.Aged just 34, he was appointed editor of the Nine O\u0027Clock News.In 1990 he was appointed director of BBC News and Current Affairs, combining TV and radio for the first time.He led BBC News until 2001, ending a 28-year career at the corporation in which he oversaw the launch of services such as Radio 5 Live, BBC News 24, BBC News Online and BBC Parliament.Lord Hall then worked as chief executive of the Royal Opera House until April 2013.In 2010 he was made a life peer and took his seat in the House of Lords as a crossbench member.Lord Hall first applied for the job of Director-General in 1999, but was beaten to the job by Greg Dyke, whose tenure lasted until 2004, when he resigned following criticism over his handling of the Hutton Inquiry.Lord Hall\u0027s time came in November 2012, when he was finally appointed Director-General.He took up the post in early March 2013, when acting director-general Tim Davie stepped down.Lord Hall gestures as he arrives for his first day as director-general of the BBC at New Broadcasting House in central London on April 2, 2013In one of his first speeches as Director-General, in October 2013, Lord Hall promised to manage the BBC robustly but with simplicity and with directness.He said: We are going to reward courage and truth telling, rather than back-covering and caution.Among Lord Hall\u0027s achievements were the launch of BBC Sounds, a centralised digital home for the BBC\u0027s audio content, and BritBox, a UK streaming service set up with other broadcasters to counter the dominance of US platforms.But his seven-year tenure was marred by a series of scandals, including the end of the universal TV licence for pensioners, and the broadcaster\u0027s publication of a male-dominated talent pay list.This inevitably drew attention to Lord Hall\u0027s own salary - £450,000 as of April 2019.During this time Sir Cliff Richard sued the broadcaster over its coverage of the police search of his Berkshire home in 2014.The singer agreed a final settlement with the BBC, receiving about £2million towards his legal costs.Lord Hall was also in the role when the BBC revamped Top Gear, after presenter Jeremy Clarkson was dropped in 2015 over what bosses called an unprovoked physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon.The broadcaster also lost the Great British Bake Off to Channel 4.The BBC One baking show was snapped up by the rival broadcaster in 2016 in a deal reportedly worth about £75 millionFormer Labour politician James Purnell has been named as the front-runner to succeed Lord Tony Hall as Director-General of the BBC.A woman could fill the top job for the first time, with Fran Unsworth also touted as a possible replacement.Bookmakers Ladbrokes are offering odds of 21 on Purnell replacing Lord Hall, who is stepping down after seven years in the role.Current BBC director of news Unsworth has odds of 41 to take up the position, while BBC Three controller Fiona Campbell has odds of 51.Former director of radio at the corporation Helen Boaden and Sarah Sands, the editor of BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, are also among the list of names touted as possible successors.Here are some of the people who could be in the running to replace Lord Hall.The BBC\u0027s director of radio and education is currently the bookmakers\u0027 favourite to take on the role.He first worked at the BBC in the 1990s as head of corporate planning but left to become a special adviser to Tony Blair after he became Prime Minister.Purnell was elected MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, before becoming Culture Secretary then Work and Pensions Secretary.He resigned from the Government in June 2009, criticising the leadership of Gordon Brown.Purnell returned to the BBC in 2013 as director of strategy and digital, and took up the role of director of radio and education in 2016.The BBC director of news began her journalistic career in 1980 in BBC local radio, joining Radio 1\u0027s Newsbeat.Her previous posts included the BBC\u0027s home news editor, head of political programmes and head of news gathering.She was the BBC\u0027s acting director of news and current affairs for periods between 2012 and 2013 and was made director of the BBC World Service Group in 2014, overseeing the biggest expansion of the World Service since the 1940s.In 2018, Ms Unsworth issued a statement outside court after Sir Cliff Richard won a High Court battle over claims the BBC had breached his privacy by broadcasting a police search of his home.It was Ms Unsworth\u0027s decision as deputy director of news at the time, to clear the use of the helicopter-shot footage. As the BBC\u0027s first female Deputy Director-General, Bulford is well-placed to replace Lord Hall.In January last year she announced she was leaving the BBC after six years as deputy.She previously worked at Channel 4 as chief operating officer and received an OBE for services to broadcasting in the 2012 Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours.Before that she spent three years working with the Royal Opera House.Formerly the chief executive of visual effects software developer Foundry, Mahon has been Channel 4\u0027s chief executive since 2017.She took over David Abraham as Channel 4 boss, becoming the first female chief executive of a major UK broadcaster.The former easyJet boss has been chief executive of ITV since 2018.Before that she was chief executive of  Media Group.Her time at the top of ITV has been characterised by the launch of BritBox and increased scrutiny over the broadcaster\u0027s reality show aftercare.Ahmed has served as the editorial director of BBC News since 2018, previously working as the broadcaster\u0027s economics editor and business editor.Before that he worked as political editor of The Observer, business editor of The Sunday  and director of communications at the Equality and Human Rights Commission.Sands has been at the head of Today, the BBC\u0027s flagship news and current affairs radio programme, since she became editor in 2017.She was appointed the first female editor of The Sunday  in 2005, and later worked as consultant editor on the Daily Mail and as editor-in-chief of the UK edition of Reader\u0027s Digest.Between 2012 and 2017 she served as editor of the London Evening Standard before taking up her current role at the BBC.Boaden spent more than 30 years working for the BBC, including as director of radio between 2013 and 2016.In 2019 she joined the board of the UK Statistics Authority for a period of three years.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

That means no popping into M\u0026ampS for a multipack of pants. No rummaging through Primark for sale socks. And certainly no scrambling through Topshop for a last-minute party dress.\u0026nbspI write about fashion as part of my job, so I\u0027m constantly keeping an eye on new boutique brands and emerging designers, who, in all honesty, I\u0027d rather give my money to than high-street brands. Not just because it supports new talent, but because the clothes tend to be more innovative and you\u0027re less likely to show up somewhere wearing the same damn polka dot dress as every other woman there. When I first announced to my friends that I’d be giving up fast fashion, they didn’t even flinch, saying: “You think you’re too cool to shop on the high street anyway.”\u0026nbsp That said, there can be no denying that your money goes further on the high street. So I love the odd haul at Zara, H\u0026ampM, or \u0026amp Other Stories that usually happens after I’ve walked past and been seduced by something in the window. And while I’d rather source my clothes from unique second-hand shops I’ve visited on trips abroad, or designer-loaded charity shops in wealthy areas of London – there are still plenty of occasions where I have to hit the high street to get what I need because of some kind of urgent wardrobe-related mishap, like a broken zip or ripped trousers.\u0026nbspThere’s also my occasional splurging habit to consider. Occasionally I save up to buy a special piece from one of my favourite (more expensive) brands: Ganni, Rixo, APC… In my head, these are more eco-friendly purchases simply because they cost more and I’ll keep them for longer. But my logic – that more money automatically means more sustainable – is obviously flawed and based on, well, nothing.\u0026nbsp I have no idea if these purchases count as fast fashion or not because I’ve never bothered to ask. Now I will have to.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch.The best dresses of the decade Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Actor Saoirse Ronan was a delight to watch in Greta Gerwig\u0027s Oscar-nominated debut, and while there were many notable outfits throughout the 2002-based film, this one remains the most meaningful. Towards the end of the film, Lady Bird goes prom dress shopping with her mum in a scene that sees their fraught relationship come to a head when Lady Bird asks “I just wish... I wish that you liked me”. Finally, she tries on this pink sparkly gown but her mother, Marion asks, “Is it too pink?” The girlish tulle gown with full skirt is reminiscent of the one worn by Molly Ringwald in the cult 1980s coming of age film, Pretty in Pink, worn as a feminist statement. OPPaul Thomas Anderson’s 2018 film Phantom Thread, centres on fictional fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his love affair with waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps).SYYes, you read that right. Balloon dresses. Jaws literally dropped when Central Saint Martins graduate sent models down the runway in balloon concubines that the models then popped, causing the outfits to slowly slide down onto the model\u0027s bodies, eventually becoming dresses. We\u0027re still not sure how he did it either, but the dresses sparked a frenzy on social media, with editors and fashion insiders all regaling at Tjaerands\u0027 sheer creativity. OP450 47 - Moneypenny\u0027s gown in Skyfall, Amanda Wakeley, 2012In what is unquestionably one of the most glamorous on-screen gowns of the decade, Naomie Harris turned about a thousand heads in this gold Amanda Wakeley gown. The column-shaped, one-shouldered dress features three straps and was constructed with fabric that fanned out from the waist to reveal folds and cuts like a sunray, twisting around Harris\u0027 torso and elevating the power and authority of her character, who remains one of the most memorable “Bond Girls” of all time. OP550 46 - Suzy Bishop\u0027s pink dress in Moonrise Kingdom, 2012This dress in Wes Anderson\u0027s 2012 Moonrise Kingdom embodies all the childhood innocence and nostalgia that defines the film. From its bubblegum-coloured hue and its Peter Pan collar to the Sixties A-line cut and the knee-high socks it\u0027s worn with, this dress was one of the best costumes in cinema from the last decade. No, it wasn\u0027t grand. And it certainly didn\u0027t look expensive, either. But, like the film itself, the dress is an homage to childlike nativity and it couldn\u0027t have been more appropriate. OPFor springsummer 2020, Rodarte designers Laura and Kate Mulleavy shunned a traditional runway show and instead chose to present their latest collection via a series of ethereal portraits.SYWhen Adut Akech stepped on stage to collect the award for 2019\u0027s model of the year, she received a standing ovation. The accolade marked a major step for the fashion industry in terms of ersity, which Akech spoke about in her rousing acceptance speech. This is for the young women and men who found representation and validation in my work, she told the crowd of designers and celebrities. I want them to never be afraid of dreaming big like I once did. Her words were bolstered by the boldness of her gown on the night: an emerald green, Christmas tree-esque Valentino gown with a bow for a bodice and a thigh-high slit. It was power personified. OPFor his 2012 adaptation of Leo Tolstoy classic Anna Karenina, director Joe Wright asked costume designer Jacqueline Durran to ensure that the leading lady (played by Keira Knightley) be dressed in costumes in the style of 1950s couture, despite the story’s 19th-century setting.SYAs a frequent front runner on the red carpet, it comes as no surprise that Janelle Monáe arrived at the 2019 Met Gala with one of the evening\u0027s best looks.SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumRodarte tutus played a starring role in the acclaimed thriller in which Natalie Portman plays a ballerina who slowly finds herself slipping into madness while practicing for a performance of Black Swan. The black tutu, worn when Portman\u0027s character dramatically casts off her innocent facade and embraces her dark side as she transforms into the Black Swan, was worn with bold feathering eye make-up, bloodshot eyes and a dark red lip. There was a scandal surrounding the dress, too. Given that neither Kate nor Laura Mulleavy (the designers at Rodarte) were part of the Costume Designers Guild, they weren\u0027t eligible for an Oscar for best costume for their work on the film. This later prompted the film\u0027s chief designer, Amy Wetcott, to respond publicly by saying the designers\u0027 involvement with the tutus had been exaggerated. Regardless, the film\u0027s tutus – and this one in particular – remain a significant part of the film\u0027s visuals. OPBaz Luhrmann\u0027s The Great Gatsby is a visual feast for many reasons but for fashion fans in particular, it is the film’s costumes that really capture the hedonistic era of the 1920s.SYWhy limit your red carpet look to just one dress when you can have four? That was the thinking behind Lady Gaga\u0027s look at the 2020 Met Gala, where the singer first stepped out in a fuchsia caped gown that had a 25-foot train. Accompanied by designer Brandon Maxwell, Gaga then began to unzip the colossal dress to reveal a corseted black number beneath complete with opera gloves. After applying some lipstick in front of the cameras, the 33-year-old then unzipped again to reveal a third look: a bright pink column dress. Finally, it was time for Gaga to offer one final ensemble: a black crystal bra with matching knickers and fishnet tights. Paired with her doll-like make-up and platinum hair, Gaga\u0027s four looks perfectly captured the playful spirit of the camp-themed event. OPWhen Priyanka Chopra married Nick Jonas in early December 2018, the pair paid tribute to the heritages of their families by having both Christian and Hindu ceremonies to mark the occasion.SYJared Leto, holding a model of his own head while clad in blood red robes on the 2020 Met Gala pink carpet, was quite a striking image. The gown was designed by Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele who showed similar looks at his autumnwinter 2018 show, sending each of the models down the runway with a fake severed head. According to Michele, each head took roughly six months to make. We are the Doctor Frankenstein of our lives, Michele told British Vogue at the time. OPGetty Images for The Met Museum1550 36 - Sansa Stark\u0027s armour dress, Game of Thrones, 2019For the final episode of Game of Thrones, the character of Sansa Stark, played by Sophie Turner, wore a dress that symbolised the journey she had been on to become Queen of the North.SYRihanna\u0027s outfit at the 2018 Met Gala where the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion \u0026amp The Catholic Imagination, is not one anybody is likely to forget any time soon. Given that RiRi had modeled her look on the Pope, the highest member of the Catholic church, some people accused her of religious appropriation and said the look was disrespectful and sexualised Catholicism. OP1750 34 - Jemima Kirke and Lena Dunham\u0027s Met Gala dresses, Christopher Kane, 2019The famous friends put the sisterhood front and centre with their co-coordinating Met Gala looks designed by Christopher Kane. Both were apt ensembles for the event\u0027s camp theme, though they were apparently rather difficult to get into, with both women reportedly having to use lubricant in order to put on the latex dresses. While the dresses were created especially for the actors, the looks reflected the playful eroticism in his autumnlwinter 2019 collection. OPGetty Images for The Met MuseumWhen it comes to making an entrance, Celine Dion knows what she\u0027s doing. Zeigfeld Girl.SYIn recent years, actor Lupita Nyong\u0027o has become one to watch on the red carpet, delivering several impressive looks throughout awards season.SYLily Rose Depp, the daughter of of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, enjoyed her second stint as a Chanel runway model in 2017, closing the fashion house’s Spring Haute Couture show. As is customary with any Chanel couture show, the final look was a bridal gown. For the showstopping moment, the 17-year-old was dressed in a ruffled blush pink gown featuring a voluminous skirt and sleeves with a corseted bodice, a Peter Pan collar and a large belt. SYSimple, playful and vintage Keira Knightley\u0027s wedding dress was famed for its understated elegance. Yes, it was Chanel couture (springsummer 2006), but unlike most celebrity wedding gowns, this one was unfussy, featuring a simple pale grey hue, a ruched strapless bodice, and a hemline that skimmed the knees as opposed to the traditional sweeping train. The gown matched the occasion, with Knightley and husband James Righton reportedly tying the knot in front of a small group of close friends and family in the south of France. Proving herself to be a supporter of sustainable fashion, Knightley even re-wore the dress (as seen here) to an charity event in London just a few months later. OP With a wardrobe consisting of printed playsuits and bleached denim, Eleven from hit sci-fi show Stranger Things became somewhat of a fashion icon as soon as the first series hit our TV screens. Stranger Things images shot up 40 times in the months following the launch of the first season, and while Eleven\u0027s pink frock has proved popular, global search platform Lyst has also witnessed a surge in searches for trucker caps and Eighties printed T-shirts inspired by characters Dustin and Chief Hopper, showing the all-round fashion clout of the show. SYActor Elle Fanning made waves with her style throughout the Cannes Film Festival but it was this 1940s-inspired look she wore to the Once Upon a Time In… Hollywood premiere that made headlines.SYWho could forget that fateful moment when Jennifer Lawrence – then at the early stages of her career – tripped and fell because of the cut of her dress as she went to collect her Academy Award for best actress for her role in Silver Linings Playbook ? Lawrence took it in her stride and got herself up before making light of the moment in her speech. The dress she wore has become instantly recognisable thanks to this moment. Strapless, fitted and with a voluminous skirt, the Dior gown suited the occasion perfectly and made Lawrence\u0027s fall one of the most graceful in history. OP2550 26 - Kendall and Kylie Jenner’s Met Gala dresses, Versace, 2019Kendall and Kylie Jenner made the grandest of entrances to the 2019 Met Gala, coordinating in bright feathered dresses. Kendall opted for a show girl-inspired bright orange feathered dress, while Kylie chose a lavender feathered gown and matching wig. Social media users instantly made plenty of comparisons to the Jenners\u0027 looks including Scooby Doo\u0027s Velma and Daphne, the sisters from Ella Enchanted, and the twins from White Chicks. On the carpet, Kendall said she and Kylie really “went for it” and designed their outfits with Donatella Versace. SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumWhen Pippa Middleton walked towards Westminster Abbey behind her sister on the 29 April 2011, few could have predicted the impact her gown would have on the world. Kate might have been the one getting married that day, but Pippa\u0027s name was in almost as many headlines thanks to the way that cowl neck ivory gown hugged her figure. Unfortunately, while many praised Sarah Burton\u0027s flawless design which had 58 buttons down the back, the moment led to an unsavoury amount of sexist commentary, with many people focusing on Middleton\u0027s body over everything else and lauding her as a sex symbol. But Pippa was able to make light of the scenario when, a few years after the wedding, she teased in an interview with the Daily Mirror that the dress fit “a little too well”. OPWhile Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u0027s red carpet choices are always commendable (she favours cult womenswear label Galvan and their signature jumpsuits), this one is her most famous thanks to a viral photograph of the Fleabag creator sat in a throne-like chair at an Emmys after party, cocktail in one hand, cigarette in the other and surrounded by her four statuettes. The photo was hailed as epitomising old school Hollywood glamour and feminist empowerment, earning Waller-Bridge\u0027s sequin covered gown much praise and adulation online.

The humble “printed dress”, as it’s called on the retailer’s website, costs just £39.99 and has been spotted on dance floors, in festivals and at several wedding receptions. Some women even got married in the dress. The retailer has since made it available in other colour ranges, including olive green, black and deep red.OPThe hit heist film American Hustle was set in New Jersey in 1978. While the male cast revived some serious crimes against fashion, from boxy suits to micro perms, the movie’s female stars, Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams lucked out.SYIf anyone is going make a sartorial statement on their wedding day, you could always count on Kate Moss. For her nuptials to Jamie Hince in 2014, the British model wore a custom John Galliano gown with sheer detailing and a floral sequin skirt. According to Galliano, the dress was inspired by Zelda Fitzgerald, the troubled wife of The Great Gatsby author F. Scott Fitzgerald. While the marriage might not have lasted – Moss and Hince split in 2016 – the impact of the model\u0027s stellar gown will certainly stand the test of time. OPWith the theme of “Camp”, this year’s Met Gala was always going to be one of the best for red carpet ensembles.American Vogue: “He envisioned me this California girl stepping out of the ocean, wet, dripping”. The reality star later revealed that the corset she wore under the dress was so tight she had to take corset-breathing lessons and struggled to sit down the entire night. SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumIn 2016 supermodel Bella Hadid attended the Cannes Film Festival wearing an Alexandre Vauthier gown that featured a slit that went above the thigh. The look prompted hundreds of headlines around the world and instantly became one of Hadid’s most memorable in addition to firmly heralding her arrival into the fashion industry. OPFor Bill Condon’s live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, the director enlisted the help of Academy Award-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran to create Belle\u0027s (Emma Watson) famous yellow gown. The dress itself featured multiple layers of yolk yellow-dyed organza and 2,160 Swarovski crystals and it took a team of seamstresses more than 12,000 hours to make. The significance of Watson’s gown was bolstered by the fact that it lit up our screens a mere two months after Emma Stone’s similarly sunshine yellow gown did the same in La La Land. Yellow went on to reign as the colour of the season that year and was soon dubbed the next millennial pink, earning the nickname “Gen Z yellow”. OPOPIf Instagram had a fling with a tutu, their child would look something like Viktor \u0026amp Rolf’s slogan dresses. With messages like “I\u0027m not shy, I just don\u0027t like you,” “Sorry I\u0027m late, I didn\u0027t want to come,” and “NO,” these voluminous tulle gowns made quite the statement when they graced the runway at Paris Couture Week in January. Not only did it suddenly seem like all our darkest and most millennial thoughts were suddenly displayed on gargantuan tutus, but said tutus went on to almost break the internet with the countless memes they prompted. People shared the photos in WhatsApp groups, tagged themselves on social media, and captioned them with things like ”Mood”. OPFor the 2019 Grammy Awards, rapper Cardi B arrived on the red carpet wearing a look straight out of a Botticelli painting. The Little Mermaid. SYIn 2012, Angelina Jolie quite literally stepped out in a black Atelier Versace gown that came with a thigh-high slit, revealing much of the actor’s leg. Jolie posed for photographers with her right leg pointed outwards, to exaggerate the slit and ensured that almost every image showed her in that pose. Showing true dedication, Jolie even maintained the pose when she presented an award on stage. The stance generated a flurry of memes and a hashtag: #AngiesRightLeg. OPDressing a First Lady for the inauguration is a momentous occasion, and one that many designers consider to be the greatest honour of their career. So, when Michelle Obama chose a relatively unknown name within the fashion sphere for the occasion, critics were taken by surprise. For her debut as First Lady, Obama chose an ivory, one-shouldered gown designed by 26-year-old Jason Wu, who was a relatively little known designer at the time. Like the rest of the world, Wu had no idea that the Obama was seriously considering wearing one of his designs and claimed that he wasn\u0027t even sure that the white chiffon dress she wore was his until the phone began to ring. “It\u0027s difficult to describe,” Wu said the following afternoon, after appearing on the morning shows. “I was over the moon. I know I am an unusual choice for a first lady. I didn\u0027t think it was my turn yet.” SYThe video for Beyonce’s visual album Lemonade in 2016 was filled with fashion that had the world abuzz, from a floral Gucci suit to a two-piece Yeezy ensemble.When Jennifer Lopez wore this dress to the 2000 Grammys it went down in fashion history, second only to Elizabeth Hurley’s iconic safety pin moment in 1994. Over the years, numerous brands have tried to copy the Versace gown but no one has managed to do it justice quite like J.Lo herself. In September 2019, the singer gave the fashion pack a dose of nostalgia at Milan Fashion Week by closing the Versace show wearing an updated version of the gown 20 years later. The crowd rose to its feet as J.Lo walked the room before linking arms with Donatella Versace for the final applause. The gown is also the reason we now have Google Images. Following Lopez’s 2000 appearance, people were so fascinated by the dress that they tried to search for photos on Google. In February, the Pose star became the most talked-about guest at the Oscars thanks to his tuxedo gown, designed by Christian Siriano. But Porter’s gown didn’t just defy sartorial conventions by blending a suit with a dress, it subverted gender norms and reflected a key societal shift. In the last year, we’ve seen more and more brands create unisex lines, showing that there is no such thing as dressing according to your gender and giving way for all of us to feel a little bit more liberated about the clothes we wear. Speaking about the gown to Variety, Porter described wearing it as a form of activism. “I knew that that tuxedo gown at the Oscars would create a conversation surrounding what gender means, what all these rules we put on everybody in life,” he said. “We’ve gotten past a problem with women wearing pants. When women wear pants it’s powerful. When men wear a dress it’s disgusting. We’re not doing that anymore. I’m not doing it.” OPWhile Meghan Markle opted for a white Givenchy wedding dress designed by artistic director Clare Waight Keller for her wedding ceremony, the bride turned to Stella McCartney for her reception gown. The Duchess of Sussex looked every bit the duchess  in the white silk halterneck gown which featured a dramatic low back and full-length skirt. The elegant dress drew compliments the world over and prompted many a copycat design before the actual dress itself became available to buy online for £3,500. According to McCartney, Markle chose her because she is a female British designer. I think being a woman and being a women’s woman played a part,” McCartney said. SYWhen an item of clothing becomes more synonymous with a breakfast than the designer who spent two years making it, you pay attention. The yolk yellow gown that Rihanna wore to the Met Gala in 2015 spawned so many memes that it’s hard to keep track of them all. Items photo-shopped onto the dress by social media users included pepperoni pizza and a Gregg’s sausage roll, but it was memes that reimagined RiRi’s gown as an omelette that acquired the most notoriety. To this day, you can ask anyone engaged with popular culture about the omelette dress and they will immediately know what you’re talking about. In fact, the elaborate caped gown was created by Chinese couturier Guo Pei and took two years to make. Two pieces by Pei were being shown at the Costume Institute that year as part of the “China: Through the Looking Glass” exhibition, which the Met Gala was held to celebrate.OPIn 2015, the internet was ided after a photo of a dress functioned as an accidental experiment in colour perception.Never has tulle caused such a ruckus.

OPFor the 2010 MTV Music Video Awards, Lady Gaga turned her back on the usual glamorous red carept garb, wearing dress made from raw flank steak, complete with matching ankle boots, a handbag and hat. In an interview with the Financial Times, Lady Gaga said the look referred to a speech she made, The Prime Rib of America, which urged the US military not to discriminate against gay men and lesbians from serving in the army. In 2015, the dress was put on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.

SY5050 1 - The black dresses at the Golden Globes, 2018While the Golden Globes are typically cause for celebration, 2018’s ceremony served as the scene of a major protest. Countless actors, presenters and nominees – including Meryl Streep, Jessica Chastain and Emma Stone – chose to wear all-black clothing in protest of sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and beyond. The move was a symbolic show of solidarity with victims of sexual harassment as part of the Time’s Up movement. Speaking about her decision to wear black to the event, Allison Brie said: I am wearing black to stand in solidarity with all of the women who have come out about being sexually harassed and abused. I\u0027m so in awe of the bravery it took for the first few to come forward. They are heroes. Out of all the women who attended the 2018 globes, just three chose not to wear black. SYActor Saoirse Ronan was a delight to watch in Greta Gerwig\u0027s Oscar-nominated debut, and while there were many notable outfits throughout the 2002-based film, this one remains the most meaningful. Towards the end of the film, Lady Bird goes prom dress shopping with her mum in a scene that sees their fraught relationship come to a head when Lady Bird asks “I just wish... I wish that you liked me”. Finally, she tries on this pink sparkly gown but her mother, Marion asks, “Is it too pink?” The girlish tulle gown with full skirt is reminiscent of the one worn by Molly Ringwald in the cult 1980s coming of age film, Pretty in Pink, worn as a feminist statement.

OP450 47 - Moneypenny\u0027s gown in Skyfall, Amanda Wakeley, 2012In what is unquestionably one of the most glamorous on-screen gowns of the decade, Naomie Harris turned about a thousand heads in this gold Amanda Wakeley gown. The column-shaped, one-shouldered dress features three straps and was constructed with fabric that fanned out from the waist to reveal folds and cuts like a sunray, twisting around Harris\u0027 torso and elevating the power and authority of her character, who remains one of the most memorable “Bond Girls” of all time. OP550 46 - Suzy Bishop\u0027s pink dress in Moonrise Kingdom, 2012This dress in Wes Anderson\u0027s 2012 Moonrise Kingdom embodies all the childhood innocence and nostalgia that defines the film. From its bubblegum-coloured hue and its Peter Pan collar to the Sixties A-line cut and the knee-high socks it\u0027s worn with, this dress was one of the best costumes in cinema from the last decade. No, it wasn\u0027t grand. And it certainly didn\u0027t look expensive, either. But, like the film itself, the dress is an homage to childlike nativity and it couldn\u0027t have been more appropriate. OPFor springsummer 2020, Rodarte designers Laura and Kate Mulleavy shunned a traditional runway show and instead chose to present their latest collection via a series of ethereal portraits.SYWhen Adut Akech stepped on stage to collect the award for 2019\u0027s model of the year, she received a standing ovation. The accolade marked a major step for the fashion industry in terms of ersity, which Akech spoke about in her rousing acceptance speech. This is for the young women and men who found representation and validation in my work, she told the crowd of designers and celebrities. I want them to never be afraid of dreaming big like I once did. Her words were bolstered by the boldness of her gown on the night: an emerald green, Christmas tree-esque Valentino gown with a bow for a bodice and a thigh-high slit. It was power personified. OPFor his 2012 adaptation of Leo Tolstoy classic Anna Karenina, director Joe Wright asked costume designer Jacqueline Durran to ensure that the leading lady (played by Keira Knightley) be dressed in costumes in the style of 1950s couture, despite the story’s 19th-century setting.SYAs a frequent front runner on the red carpet, it comes as no surprise that Janelle Monáe arrived at the 2019 Met Gala with one of the evening\u0027s best looks.SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumRodarte tutus played a starring role in the acclaimed thriller in which Natalie Portman plays a ballerina who slowly finds herself slipping into madness while practicing for a performance of Black Swan. The black tutu, worn when Portman\u0027s character dramatically casts off her innocent facade and embraces her dark side as she transforms into the Black Swan, was worn with bold feathering eye make-up, bloodshot eyes and a dark red lip. There was a scandal surrounding the dress, too. Given that neither Kate nor Laura Mulleavy (the designers at Rodarte) were part of the Costume Designers Guild, they weren\u0027t eligible for an Oscar for best costume for their work on the film. This later prompted the film\u0027s chief designer, Amy Wetcott, to respond publicly by saying the designers\u0027 involvement with the tutus had been exaggerated. Regardless, the film\u0027s tutus – and this one in particular – remain a significant part of the film\u0027s visuals. OPBaz Luhrmann\u0027s The Great Gatsby is a visual feast for many reasons but for fashion fans in particular, it is the film’s costumes that really capture the hedonistic era of the 1920s.SYWhy limit your red carpet look to just one dress when you can have four? That was the thinking behind Lady Gaga\u0027s look at the 2020 Met Gala, where the singer first stepped out in a fuchsia caped gown that had a 25-foot train. Accompanied by designer Brandon Maxwell, Gaga then began to unzip the colossal dress to reveal a corseted black number beneath complete with opera gloves. After applying some lipstick in front of the cameras, the 33-year-old then unzipped again to reveal a third look: a bright pink column dress. Finally, it was time for Gaga to offer one final ensemble: a black crystal bra with matching knickers and fishnet tights. Paired with her doll-like make-up and platinum hair, Gaga\u0027s four looks perfectly captured the playful spirit of the camp-themed event.

The gown was designed by Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele who showed similar looks at his autumnwinter 2018 show, sending each of the models down the runway with a fake severed head. According to Michele, each head took roughly six months to make. We are the Doctor Frankenstein of our lives, Michele told British Vogue at the time.

Given that RiRi had modeled her look on the Pope, the highest member of the Catholic church, some people accused her of religious appropriation and said the look was disrespectful and sexualised Catholicism. OP1750 34 - Jemima Kirke and Lena Dunham\u0027s Met Gala dresses, Christopher Kane, 2019The famous friends put the sisterhood front and centre with their co-coordinating Met Gala looks designed by Christopher Kane. Both were apt ensembles for the event\u0027s camp theme, though they were apparently rather difficult to get into, with both women reportedly having to use lubricant in order to put on the latex dresses. While the dresses were created especially for the actors, the looks reflected the playful eroticism in his autumnlwinter 2019 collection.

As is customary with any Chanel couture show, the final look was a bridal gown. For the showstopping moment, the 17-year-old was dressed in a ruffled blush pink gown featuring a voluminous skirt and sleeves with a corseted bodice, a Peter Pan collar and a large belt. SYSimple, playful and vintage Keira Knightley\u0027s wedding dress was famed for its understated elegance. Yes, it was Chanel couture (springsummer 2006), but unlike most celebrity wedding gowns, this one was unfussy, featuring a simple pale grey hue, a ruched strapless bodice, and a hemline that skimmed the knees as opposed to the traditional sweeping train. The gown matched the occasion, with Knightley and husband James Righton reportedly tying the knot in front of a small group of close friends and family in the south of France. Proving herself to be a supporter of sustainable fashion, Knightley even re-wore the dress (as seen here) to an charity event in London just a few months later. OP With a wardrobe consisting of printed playsuits and bleached denim, Eleven from hit sci-fi show Stranger Things became somewhat of a fashion icon as soon as the first series hit our TV screens. Stranger Things images shot up 40 times in the months following the launch of the first season, and while Eleven\u0027s pink frock has proved popular, global search platform Lyst has also witnessed a surge in searches for trucker caps and Eighties printed T-shirts inspired by characters Dustin and Chief Hopper, showing the all-round fashion clout of the show. SYActor Elle Fanning made waves with her style throughout the Cannes Film Festival but it was this 1940s-inspired look she wore to the Once Upon a Time In… Hollywood premiere that made headlines.SYWho could forget that fateful moment when Jennifer Lawrence – then at the early stages of her career – tripped and fell because of the cut of her dress as she went to collect her Academy Award for best actress for her role in Silver Linings Playbook ? Lawrence took it in her stride and got herself up before making light of the moment in her speech. The dress she wore has become instantly recognisable thanks to this moment. Strapless, fitted and with a voluminous skirt, the Dior gown suited the occasion perfectly and made Lawrence\u0027s fall one of the most graceful in history. OP2550 26 - Kendall and Kylie Jenner’s Met Gala dresses, Versace, 2019Kendall and Kylie Jenner made the grandest of entrances to the 2019 Met Gala, coordinating in bright feathered dresses. Kendall opted for a show girl-inspired bright orange feathered dress, while Kylie chose a lavender feathered gown and matching wig. Social media users instantly made plenty of comparisons to the Jenners\u0027 looks including Scooby Doo\u0027s Velma and Daphne, the sisters from Ella Enchanted, and the twins from White Chicks. On the carpet, Kendall said she and Kylie really “went for it” and designed their outfits with Donatella Versace. SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumWhen Pippa Middleton walked towards Westminster Abbey behind her sister on the 29 April 2011, few could have predicted the impact her gown would have on the world. Kate might have been the one getting married that day, but Pippa\u0027s name was in almost as many headlines thanks to the way that cowl neck ivory gown hugged her figure. Unfortunately, while many praised Sarah Burton\u0027s flawless design which had 58 buttons down the back, the moment led to an unsavoury amount of sexist commentary, with many people focusing on Middleton\u0027s body over everything else and lauding her as a sex symbol. But Pippa was able to make light of the scenario when, a few years after the wedding, she teased in an interview with the Daily Mirror that the dress fit “a little too well”. OPWhile Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u0027s red carpet choices are always commendable (she favours cult womenswear label Galvan and their signature jumpsuits), this one is her most famous thanks to a viral photograph of the Fleabag creator sat in a throne-like chair at an Emmys after party, cocktail in one hand, cigarette in the other and surrounded by her four statuettes. The photo was hailed as epitomising old school Hollywood glamour and feminist empowerment, earning Waller-Bridge\u0027s sequin covered gown much praise and adulation online.

The dress itself featured multiple layers of yolk yellow-dyed organza and 2,160 Swarovski crystals and it took a team of seamstresses more than 12,000 hours to make. The significance of Watson’s gown was bolstered by the fact that it lit up our screens a mere two months after Emma Stone’s similarly sunshine yellow gown did the same in La La Land. Yellow went on to reign as the colour of the season that year and was soon dubbed the next millennial pink, earning the nickname “Gen Z yellow”.

With messages like “I\u0027m not shy, I just don\u0027t like you,” “Sorry I\u0027m late, I didn\u0027t want to come,” and “NO,” these voluminous tulle gowns made quite the statement when they graced the runway at Paris Couture Week in January. Not only did it suddenly seem like all our darkest and most millennial thoughts were suddenly displayed on gargantuan tutus, but said tutus went on to almost break the internet with the countless memes they prompted. People shared the photos in WhatsApp groups, tagged themselves on social media, and captioned them with things like ”Mood”.

OPDressing a First Lady for the inauguration is a momentous occasion, and one that many designers consider to be the greatest honour of their career. So, when Michelle Obama chose a relatively unknown name within the fashion sphere for the occasion, critics were taken by surprise. For her debut as First Lady, Obama chose an ivory, one-shouldered gown designed by 26-year-old Jason Wu, who was a relatively little known designer at the time. Like the rest of the world, Wu had no idea that the Obama was seriously considering wearing one of his designs and claimed that he wasn\u0027t even sure that the white chiffon dress she wore was his until the phone began to ring. “It\u0027s difficult to describe,” Wu said the following afternoon, after appearing on the morning shows. “I was over the moon. I know I am an unusual choice for a first lady. I didn\u0027t think it was my turn yet.” SYThe video for Beyonce’s visual album Lemonade in 2016 was filled with fashion that had the world abuzz, from a floral Gucci suit to a two-piece Yeezy ensemble.When Jennifer Lopez wore this dress to the 2000 Grammys it went down in fashion history, second only to Elizabeth Hurley’s iconic safety pin moment in 1994. Over the years, numerous brands have tried to copy the Versace gown but no one has managed to do it justice quite like J.Lo herself. In September 2019, the singer gave the fashion pack a dose of nostalgia at Milan Fashion Week by closing the Versace show wearing an updated version of the gown 20 years later. The crowd rose to its feet as J.Lo walked the room before linking arms with Donatella Versace for the final applause. The gown is also the reason we now have Google Images.

Or forget to pack a second pair of underwear for after my lunchtime gym session? Such issues arise – all too often for me – and it’s arguably easiest to solve them by heading to the nearest high street shop, which, let’s face it, is probably not going to sell eco-friendly lingerie.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Untroubled by a commute? Even with house prices outside London taking off, Leafy Didsbury is still a lot cheaper than leafy Dulwich.\u0026nbspBut here’s the thing: none of that is really relevant. Despite the antipathy of parts of the Tory Party to the project, and the doubts expressed by Boris Johnson, the signal almost has to read “go”.\u0026nbspThis is a project whose symbolism trumps any metrics, or evidence based analysis, and this is a government that ought to be well aware of the\u0026nbsppower of that.It is, after all, powered by an even bigger folly, Brexit. All the metrics, all the evidence based analysis suggest that the cost of that will make even a worst case scenario HS2 look like a rounding error.\u0026nbspJohnson will probably never be as powerful as he is today. He has a huge majority and faces a weak and ided opposition. A hollowed out Tory Party has been reshaped in his image and is in his thrall.\u0026nbspAnd yet HS2 represents a rare danger to him, a project that has the potential to undermine his credibility in a part of the country which only queasily placed its faith in him and his party when it handed him the majority he craved.\u0026nbspThe project has broad, cross party support in the north. Were it to be canned, the message could be said to be get Brexit done but after that nothing changes, you’re back in your box. We might come up here and hold the occasional session of Parliament for show but that’s your lot.\u0026nbspJust imagine if high speed rail were to stop at Birmingham, if the creaky conventional network took over from there, even with improvements.

There are now record gaps in trust levels between these two groups in eight countries.Edelman said that businesses had a key role to play in restoring trust in the economic system. While business as a whole was deemed “competent” by a majority of those polled, it received a negative rating for ethical behaviour such as acting to halt climate change.“Climate issues are among the most important, and business leaders can no longer brush aside consumer concerns as brands can be quickly tarnished if they are deemed to be unethical,” Edelman said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its stores“The company is currently engaged in constructive discussions with both shareholders and potential new investors on the proposed equity raise.”An equity raise involves issuing new shares to raise extra cash – but this tends to push the current share price down, which could upset current investors.Matthew Roberts, Intu chief executive, said: “We are making good progress with fixing the balance sheet, our number one priority, and are confident we have the right strategy in place to enable us to prosper as we see continued polarisation between the best destinations and the rest.”He added that footfall to Intu’s UK centres was flat during the Christmas period compared with a year earlier – which was ahead of falls across the market more broadly.Around 95 per cent of space was occupied by tenants, with 97 per cent of rent collected for the first quarter of 2020, Intu said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Intu banked €237.7m (£202m) from the deal as a part owner.The amount Intu hopes to raise from shareholders remains unclear, although reports in the Sunday Times put the figure at up to £1bn.Intu shareholder and billionaire businessman John Whittaker, who has a 27 per cent stake, is said to be in favour of the plan, according to the newspaper.Commercial property owners, particularly in retail, have suffered in recent years as several big name brands either went into administration or pushed through an insolvency process known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to reduce rents.In November last year, Intu already warned that rental income in 2019 is likely to fall by 9 per cent, with more than half the decline coming from Arcadia and Monsoon using CVAs.Bosses said rent in 2020 is also expected to drop, but at a slower rate than 2019, and added that the political and economic uncertainty is putting off current tenants from signing up to new lettings.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There was a 7.4 per cent annual increase in the number of sales agreed.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesMiles Shipside, director and housing market analyst at Rightmove, said the figures indicated that many buyers and sellers felt the election result had given a “window of stability”.“The housing market dislikes uncertainty, and the unsettled political outlook over the last three and a half years since the EU referendum caused some potential home movers to hesitate,” he said.House prices rise at fastest monthly rate since 2013“Whilst a substantial rise is the norm in January, buoyed by the start of a new year, this is the biggest new year price surge that we have ever recorded.”Mr Shipside said that while there might be “more twists and turns” in the Brexit saga, there was now an opportunity for sellers to get their property on the market for a spring move unaffected by Brexit deadlines“There now seems to be a release of this pent-up demand, which suggests we are in store for an active spring market. The early birds are on it, with over 1.3 million buyer enquiries to agents since the election,” he said.However, Mr Shipside warned sellers not to get “carried away” with their pricing and miss out on a window of increased activity, saying that high prices meant many buyers faced stretched affordability.The Rightmove report will add to growing evidence that the election result has\u0026nbsptriggered renewed optimism in the housing market. Last week Halifax said prices rose in December at the fastest pace since 2013, while the surveyors’\u0026nbsporganisation RICS said 17 per cent more respondents had seen a rise rather than fall in enquiries from new buyers.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The findings are published as business leaders and heads of state fly to the World Economic Forum annual meeting, which begins on Tuesday, in Davos.Inequality and climate change will be close to the top of the agenda at this year’s summit, which has once again been targeted by protesters.Rosalina Mueller, a spokesperson\u0026nbspfor the Young Socialists, which\u0026nbspis helping to organise demonstrations, told the Associated Press\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspDavos attendees had failed to make a positive impact in previous years.“They say they want to make the world better, but for 50 years they haven’t done anything,” she said.While faith in capitalism has held up in Asia and the Middle East, Edelman’s survey found that a majority in every developed market do not believe they will be better off in five years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFears about the impact of automation, lack of training, immigration and insecure work are all eroding trust, as well as fake news and corruption, Edelman said.Distrust is being driven by a growing sense that capitalism in its present guise is unfair\u0026nbspand that institutions increasingly serve the interests of a narrow elite over everyone else.Governments have taken a bigger hit to their reputations than businesses, the media or NGOs, with a failure to tackle inequality the most important driving factor.Just 30 per cent of the general population said the government serves the interests of everyone compared with 57 per cent who said it serves only the few.Raise taxes on the rich to tackle inequality, IMF saysDeep-seated fears about the future have helped to foment growing cynicism about the economic system, according to the research.More than four in five respondents say they fear losing their jobs, citing concerns including\u0026nbspthe gig economy, a looming recession,\u0026nbsplack of skills, cheaper foreign competitors, immigrants who will work for less, automation\u0026nbspor jobs being moved to other countries.This toxic set of concerns has been blamed for the rise of populist, anti-establishment politicians and anti-immigration rhetoric in several countries.The survey found wealthier, more highly educated groups were significantly more trusting of institutions than the rest of the population. There are now record gaps in trust levels between these two groups in eight countries.Edelman said that businesses had a key role to play in restoring trust in the economic system. While business as a whole was deemed “competent” by a majority of those polled, it received a negative rating for ethical behaviour such as acting to halt climate change.“Climate issues are among the most important, and business leaders can no longer brush aside consumer concerns as brands can be quickly tarnished if they are deemed to be unethical,” Edelman said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Fingers crossed.Fans of Lynch will be happy to know the short is as bizarre as they are probably hoping – it follows a police detective (Lynch) who interrogates a talking monkey about a murder he may have committed.Jack the talking monkey also seems to be as much of a fan of coffee as Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks. “I ordered coffee about a half hour ago,” he bellows at one stage.Created with Sketch.19 films to look out for in 2020 Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter.

Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)Lynch’s Blue Velvet is the only other one of his films that ca currently be watched on Netflix. His other credits include The Elephant Man, Eraserhead and Inland Empire.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

which I understand and a lot of problems have been created by the industry itself - to fixing it, and you can only fix it by legislators and regulators setting down new rules, just as they set down new rules for cars and every new technology which has ever erupted in the history of time.The former Liberal Democrat leader also dismissed the suggestion that internet companies should more tightly police the content of adverts themselves.Twitter announced last year that it had banned political advertising entirely on its platform.Sir Nick acknowledged that Facebook\u0027s current approach was not as robust as some want - which is for tech firms to start vetting and fact-checking every claim made in political advertising - but he argued this would place private companies in the unsuitable role of deciding what should and should not be defined as truth.I know this from 20 years in politics, political speech is by definition a sort of form of caricature - politicians caricature their virtues, caricature their opponents\u0027 vices and the idea that private companies should be the people to draw that fine line seems to us and to other Silicon Valley companies as an inappropriate power, he said.On Facebook\u0027s specific approach to political advertising, he claimed there had been a lot of crossed wires about Facebook\u0027s stance, and argued it was not an entirely new concept.Broadcasters in the United States, are not entitled under law, to block political advertisements because of the content of them, he said.So the stance that we\u0027re taking is not an outlier, it is a stance that has been in place in US politics for a long period.He added that Facebook\u0027s launch of a political advert library and other controls around how and why users saw certain adverts were industry-leading in dealing with the issue of election interference.Facebook, far more than Twitter and Google, is investing in industry-leading transparency - and also giving users control, so if users don\u0027t want to see, or want to see fewer political ads, they can press a button and receive fewer political ads, he said.But crucially, unlike 2016 (in the US presidential election) or the Brexit referendum, where ads were run on Facebook apps and it was impossible for rival campaigners to see who was doing what, that has changed utterly.So now, campaigns in real-time can see who is paying for the ad, who they are trying to target, what their message is, what the different variants are of their message and so on.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One of the most promising is artificial intelligence.Yet history is full of examples of how technology\u0027s virtues aren\u0027t guaranteed. Internal combustion engines allowed people to travel beyond their own areas but also caused more accidents. The internet made it possible to connect with anyone and get information from anywhere, but also easier for misinformation to spread.How Google grew out of a garage into a trillion-dollar empireMr Pichai pointed to Google\u0027s own published principles on AI, and said existing rules such as the GDPR in the EU could be used as the foundation for AI regulation.International alignment will be critical to making global standards work. To get there, we need agreement on core values. Companies such as ours cannot just build promising new technology and let market forces decide how it will be used. It is equally incumbent on us to make sure that technology is harnessed for good and available to everyone, he said.He added that the tech giant wanted to work with others on crafting regulation.Google\u0027s role starts with recognising the need for a principled and regulated approach to applying AI, but it doesn\u0027t end there.

It sees the regolith placed into a metal basket alongside a salt, and then heated up to 950 degrees Celsius, and then having a current passed through it.That leads the oxygen to come out of the dust and be ready to be collected. The rest of the regolith is also converted into metal alloys.Scientists hope this process can be made into a form that could be used on the Moon, with the hope of getting it there in the mid-2020s.“ESA and NASA are heading back to the Moon with crewed missions, this time with a view towards staying,” said\u0026nbspTommaso Ghidini, Head of ESA’s Structures, Mechanisms and Materials Division.“Accordingly we’re shifting our engineering approach to a systematic use of lunar resources in-situ.We are working with our colleagues in the Human and Robotics Exploration Directorate, European industry and academia to provide top class scientific approaches and key enabling technologies like this one, towards a sustained human presence on the Moon and maybe one day Mars.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If that plan is successful, it will allow for the US to launch its own astronauts for the first time since the end of Nasa\u0027s space shuttle programme, in 2011.In the abort test,\u0026nbspCrew Dragon detached from the Falcon 9 rocket at more than double the speed of sound, Musk told reporters, at 131,000 feet (40km) above the Atlantic Ocean – roughly twice the altitude of a commercial jetliner.It is a picture perfect mission. It went as well as one can possibly expect, Musk said at a press conference.National Aeronautics and Space Administration administrator Jim Bridenstine also described the test as a success.Crew Dragon, an acorn-shaped pod that can seat seven astronauts, fired on-board thrusters to detach itself from the rocket less than two minutes after liftoff, simulating an emergency abort scenario to prove it can return astronauts to safety. Each stage of the test prompted loud cheers from SpaceX crew members watching the footage from back on land.The capsule deployed four parachutes to slow its descent, and carried two human-shaped test dummies on seats fitted with motion sensors to collect data on the immense g-force – the effect of acceleration on the body – astronauts would be subjected to during abort.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There was a 7.4 per cent annual increase in the number of sales agreed.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesMiles Shipside, director and housing market analyst at Rightmove, said the figures indicated that many buyers and sellers felt the election result had given a “window of stability”.“The housing market dislikes uncertainty, and the unsettled political outlook over the last three and a half years since the EU referendum caused some potential home movers to hesitate,” he said.House prices rise at fastest monthly rate since 2013“Whilst a substantial rise is the norm in January, buoyed by the start of a new year, this is the biggest new year price surge that we have ever recorded.”Mr Shipside said that while there might be “more twists and turns” in the Brexit saga, there was now an opportunity for sellers to get their property on the market for a spring move unaffected by Brexit deadlines“There now seems to be a release of this pent-up demand, which suggests we are in store for an active spring market. The early birds are on it, with over 1.3 million buyer enquiries to agents since the election,” he said.However, Mr Shipside warned sellers not to get “carried away” with their pricing and miss out on a window of increased activity, saying that high prices meant many buyers faced stretched affordability.The Rightmove report will add to growing evidence that the election result has\u0026nbsptriggered renewed optimism in the housing market. Last week Halifax said prices rose in December at the fastest pace since 2013, while the surveyors’\u0026nbsporganisation RICS said 17 per cent more respondents had seen a rise rather than fall in enquiries from new buyers.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And what are the symptoms?Coronaviruses are a group of virus that cause respiratory infections – diseases ranging from the common cold to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). This is the\u0026nbspseventh\u0026nbspknown to infect humans.SARS first infected people in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800. The Chinese government initially tried to conceal the severity of the SARS epidemic, but its cover-up was exposed by a high-ranking physician.Created with Sketch.China coronavirus: Cases soar of deadly new flu-like virus Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Medical staff transfer patients to Jin Yintan hospital in Wuhan.

Initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus are mainly fever, health officials said, with some experiencing coughing, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath. Scans on some patients have shown fluid in the lungs consistent with viral pneumonia.The World Health Organisation (WHO), which was first informed of the cluster of illness in Wuhan on 31 December, said the new disease was isolated for study on 7 January after other causes such as SARS, avian flu and MERS had been ruled out. It said it was closely following the current outbreak.Is it contagious?Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others said they had cancelled their New Year travel plans.\u0026nbspState media praised the apparent evolution of the official response since the deadly SARS outbreak 17 years ago.“In the early days of SARS, reports were delayed and covered up,” said an editorial in the state-run Global Times. “That kind of thing must not happen again in China.”“We have made great strides in medicine, social affairs management and public opinion since 2003,” the editorial added.The WHO said it was reassured by the authorities’ response, and that it did not see the need for any further recommendations against travel to China at this time.And what about outside China?At least half a dozen countries in Asia and three US airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China.Videos posted online showed people in protective suits checking one by one the temperatures of plane passengers arriving in Macao, a Chinese special administrative region, from Wuhan. A man surnamed Yang who works for the Macao Health Bureau confirmed over the phone that such checks are indeed taking place in the southern Chinese region.Authorities in Thailand and Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China. The WHO said contact-tracing efforts were under way and, in Japan, the government was coordinating across ministries to assess and contain the risk of outbreak.South Korea reported its first case on Monday, when a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive for the new coronavirus one day after arriving at Seoul’s Incheon airport.

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University. She had flitted easily between both sides, up until recently, when she moved to Shanghai. “I think the situation in Hong Kong is quite sensitive now, which is easy for people to have conflicts due to different political stands,” she says. “That’s why I’ve decided to leave Hong Kong to work and get away from the intense environment.”Even though the protests in Hong Kong show no sign of abating, Ke remains optimistic unity will overcome ision. She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s incredible.“Me and my we are so happy he was found safe and well and we remain very grateful to the police and members of public who gave up their time to help search for him.”Umair, , from Nottingham., who runs a used car dealership, said: “The picture I am sharing shows how well and happy my son looks.He doesn’t want to talk about the incident, he just wants to forget it and we’re letting him forget it and not pushing him. He was not frightened, he was very brave.”The delighted dad previously told how he kept praying that his son Aadil would be found safe and well after he went missing .The frantic dad told The Sun Online: I had every faith that the police would find him. My faith helped me through a very dficult time.He told the BBC: Police told me he was sleeping when they found him.He said that his we, who had stayed at home with their younger son, had feared the worst but he “never gave up hope.”After being spotted by a helicopter nine hours later, the little lad, who only had a jumper to keep him warm, was reunited with his dad.More than , members of the public helped in the search for the schoolboy.Umair, , speaking exclusively to The Sun Online from his home in Nottingham said: “My boy was thankfully found safe.That’s all that matters. I never stopped hoping and police kept reassuring me they’d find him.He has no idea about all the fuss surrounding him.He had been wandering up and down the side of the motorway after going to the toilet and when he came out he couldn’t find the coach and he got lost from the rest group.Umair told how the horror unfolded when he got a call from the police saying his son was missing.The pupil at a school in Nottingham had been on a coach trip to London to visit some off the sights and a museum.The group stopped for a break at Newport Pagnell Service Station near Milton Keynes, Bucks, before continuing with their -mile journey north to Nottingham.Umair said: “You hear of children going missing and never being found after many years like the girl Madeleine McCann.But with my son we knew he couldn’t have gone far and was hopefully still somewhere nearby.“At the time you don’t really know but I couldn’t let silly thoughts get inside my head.I had to stay strong and hopeful. He hadnt been snatched by anyone, he had wandered off and got lost.Thankfully he didn’t get onto the M, he remained at the side of the motorway.”Umair said that his relatives and close friends were relieved to hear the good news of the six-year-olds .Aadil, however, was busy playing with his brother before being told by his parents to “get some sleep.”He said: “I cannot thank the police and local community enough. They are lesavers.They were excellent. My boy is fine, he is comfortable.”His we added: “Our child is safe, we are blessed and so thankful to everyone who helped find him. It is such a relief.”Superintendent Amy Clements said this morning: This was a very dficult operation involving a very young boy and we are relieved to say that Aadil has been found safe and well.I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the local community, who immediately offered help in trying to find Aadil.Also Id like to thank those who have co-operated with Police during this time.This was a large operation in dficult conditions so Id like to also publicly thank the search and rescue teams who assisted in the search and the large number of officers involved, including the National Police Air Service which helped bring this positive resolution.We are so very glad that he has been found and are thankful to everyone involved in assisting with that.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But not necessarily £.million.So Harry is doing the right and ­honourable thing.The title HRH is an automatic one for someone with Royal blood.Even when Edward VIII abdicated he dropped from being His Majesty The King to HRH the Duke of Windsor.Diana, Princess of Wales and Sarah Ferguson lost theirs because their courtesy titles were obtained through marriage. They were not born royal. But what is also notable is that it won’t stop the Americans using the titlethey wish to.When Edward married Wallis ­Simpson she didn’t get an HRH yet she was still sometimes referred to in America as HRH.I’m not saying it will happen on this occasion but it is possible as it sits quite nicely with Duke and Duchess.Harry is not using his HRH  because it would be a conflict of interest should he decide to embark on ­commercial enterprises.Harry knows full well that it is wrong to trade on your name.I don’t think not using it will have an impact. It didn’t affect Diana’s global appeal one bit. And Fergie had less of a profile but still made money.The Queen is pragmatic. She will be sad, too. She is very sensitive to Harry and his needs. She was there for him and William when their mother was killed in the car crash.She understands and she wants the best for her grandson, his we and her great-grandson.She has come to an accord that works for both sides and that is what is important to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If anything, our scoop simply sped up the process.Royal commentators trumpeting Saturday night’s declaration as a total victory for the Queen are somewhat missing the point – Harry and Meghan are DELIGHTED with this result too.With a few marked concessionsthey’ve got exactly what they wanted: The ability to make millions and millions without royal oversight, to spend as much time as they want in Hollywood and to avoid any duty in the UK.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes. For further details of our complaints policy and to make a complaint please click here."},{"url":null,"title":"samantha markle meghan harry never find happiness","story":"With this historic institution close to collapse, we have to ask whether peace can really be found.The statements from Buckingham Palace and the Queen showed the Royal Family want to repair the damage.There is no doubt that the decision of Prince Harry and Meghan to quit their duties so soon after their fairytale wedding has done great harm.It would have been betterdiscord had never been sown.Meghan knew the social requirements of joining the Royal Family. She should have asked herselfshe was willing and able to behave in accordance with the expectations.Her Majesty’s words show great diplomacy but Meghan’s behaviour has so far not been diplomatic. A diplomat wouldn’t fall out with her own family.Her friends leaked negative comments about the “toxic” Royal Family. She also allowed damage to be done against our family via friends and PR advisers.She watched the media taunt and torture my dad, never springing to his defence like a true humanitarian would.Thomas was an incredible dad. He paid every penny of her education and cared greatly for her.He is now frail, with a heart condition. He doesn’t have a PR team to spin him a good story.The Queen, at , shouldn’t have had to face the stress of seeing her family torn apart.Meghan hasn’t stepped forward to minimise the damage.She knows how Harry leaving has affected them, but she hasn’t spoken up in their defence.Yet in her statement, the Queen says she is “particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family”.Her Majesty is building bridges there. It would be goodMeghan could do the same.She could have expressed her thanks for the kindness of the Queen and Prince Charles.She could have expressed gratitude to her own father or her first husband, Trevor, who gave her career opportunities.My sister has become a totally dferent person, choosing wealth and fortune over family.Her decision to leave is nothing to do with the behaviour of the royals, or race.Her marriage to Prince Harry was so symbolic of ethnic unity.The preacher and choir were all of African heritage. It was a lovely joining together.The royals embraced that. They welcomed Meghan into their lives, into the culture, and allowed her to promote people of all races. I have never heard anything racist coming out of the Windsors about my sister.Supporters who claim a racist element forced Meghan out are frustrated their hoped-for fairytale princess didn’t work out.These social equality-obsessed people had pinned their hopes on Meghan. They hoped for an equality of race right at the higher echelons of society.At least Harry and Meghan were right to decide tothe £.million they received to renovate Frogmore Cottage and not take any more public funds.In the Queen’s statement, she hopes Meghan and Harry can “start building a happy and peaceful le”. We have to hope for the sake of my sister and for the Royal Family that this agreement achieves that aim.My fear is Meghan’s decision isn’t about moving to Canada for a quiet le as a young mother.Nothing about their actions so far suggest they truly desire a private le out the limelight.They have paraded themselves on the red carpet, tried to make deals with Disney, and become pals with the Clooneys and other A-list stars.Smooching up to Vogue magazine, to fashion and to the film industry is not consistent with taking a step back.Their objective is fame and fortune — to be Hollywood.Meghan’s goals are not consistent with those of the Royal Family. Personally, I don’t believe she ever expected to fit in with the strict structures and traditions of the Windsor household.Even after marrying she kept her lawyer and publicity adviser, suggesting she wasn’t willing to sever her ties with her old le.Perhaps she always had the idea toto her le as an actress and lestyle influencer.In the statement from Buckingham Palace, it says “the Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty”.My concern is that this is a face-saving statement, which won’t work in reality. The Royal Family has always been opposed to merchandising and corporate endeavours outside of them.If Meghan and Harry want to honour the Queen, they will consult her before doing deals.She thinks she can be at the top of the world, but using the royals to get that international notoriety is tacky.Meghan was a cable TV actress before marrying Harry and would not be on the front of every newspaper and magazine without him.In the US, the Press is still positive, praising her attempts to modernise the British monarchy and saying how cool she is.The media in Calornia and New York are likely to remain in her corner but I don’t think Meghan and Harry will ever be able to overshadow Prince William and his we Catherine.They are exemplary they are iconic. There is no comparison.It is clear Meghan cares for Archie, but I do worry about his future. There doesn’t seem to have been a lot of consideration given to his cousins George, Charlotte and Louis and how often he will see them. Harry has put Meghan above his brother, father and grandmother. A house ided cannot stand.I am worried that Meghan and Harry will never find true ­happiness. They could not find contentment with the Royal Family, will they be able to find it away from them Maybe they will meet up with counsellors who can help them to heal the wounds.Perhaps they will make amends by apologising.We need sincerity and dignity from Meghan in order to find peace. Then, perhaps, she will have the peace she needs to go forward.I loved my sister, but I do not like the person she has become.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We like — we love — our Queen here in Britain.But we are not prepared to pay the way for her multi-millionaire grandson — £million inheritance from his mum and £million from the Queen Mum —he no longer wishes to be a full-time royal.There is no royal halfway house — no one foot in, one foot out — as Her Majesty has rightly agreed.So yes, we want back the £.million we spent on the renovations of a “cottage” which he will seldom live in. So far, so good.But there are problems with this deal, some of which may well come back to bite Buckingham ­Palace and its push for a “hard Megxit”.Harry, a -year-old married father, is still taking money from his dad’s Duchy of Cornwall estate, despite his stated desire to live a financially independent le. This turbo-charged pocket money amounts to over £million a year at present.Traditionally, the sons of the heirs to the throne rely on the Duchy to fund their lives while they go about their royal duties, but without those duties Harry no longer needs to rely on the Bank of Dad.If the Prince of Wales chooses to fund his son and Meghan, it is his choice. But he will only do it in an attempt to maintain some necessary control over their expenditure. This is problematic for free-spirited Harry — and Charles, who will almost certainly not approve of everything this money is spent on.Sure, Harry and Meghan can make millions of dollars by lending their names to commercial ventures. But the Buckingham Palace statement says: “The Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty.” What an alarmingly vague and woolly line.We can take a stab at what these values are — ask any good Christian. But how do they relate to commercial deals with huge American corporations For example, Harry has been touting Meghan for voiceover work with Disney.But which characters are brand-safe  Presumably Cruella de Vil is off limits And what about interviews  A big- money sit-down with a US network — their pal Oprah Winfrey would surely be first in line — would net a huge fee. But what can they say and still uphold the Queen’s values The world is interested in Meghan and Harry’s touchy-feely philanthropic endeavours, but what they really want is the juice. What’s it really like in the Royal Family  How they approach this is crucial.Arguably, they should never discuss the “family” on TV — the Queen does not. If they write books, it should not be about their personal experiences within the “family”. And any products from their brand should be unrelated to the Royal Family.If their money-making ventures are focused on the charities they support, they will be fine. Their new foundation could make them millions but while doing so make millions for their charities, too. This is how they could get away with it. But will this be enough for the ambitious Meghan  I somehow doubt it.However nice Her Majesty appears to be, she has given up her le and much of her personal happiness to do her duty and it is a new world for her to see her grandson no longer feels capable of doing the same — albeit in a much smaller way — himself.While incredibly astute, the deal is not what the Queen wanted. She would have preferred to keep them within the royal fold, but she does not want another Diana disaster. Diana knew the system was not hers to change, and it is not Harry and Meghan’s either. It belongs to the Queen.She tried to accommodate Diana within it. What the Queen could not do was to restructure the monarchy to suit her daughter-in-law. As she now can’t reconstruct the monarchy for her grandson and his we. So, she has asked them to step away.The last thing the Queen wanted was for it to look asthe Duke and Duchess of Sussex had been thrown out of the royal fold. Archie Mountbatten Windsor is her and Prince Philip’s eighth great-grandchild. His future is important to them as it might also embody a small part of the future of a modern monarchy. But how much of a royal this soon-to-be largely Canadian-bred lad will ever be remains to be seen. Not much, is the best bet.The Sussexes have what they want. They don’t want to be criticised for taking monies from the British taxpayer. They don’t want to be seen as taking advantage of the Queen’s kindness. And whatever other members of the Royal Family might think of them, and be disappointed by them, Harry is the son of the future King.So Her Majesty has accommodated them. It is now up to them to show their loyalty to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He warned the Left’s obsession is providing a cloak for crime.The Sussexes’ decision to quit was “not racism”, he told a cheering crowd. “We’re the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe.”Signicantly, the applause came not from the far Right but from right-on BBC Question Time — an audience carefully chosen, stressed presenter Fiona Bruce, to reflect Britain by age, sex and politics.Fox — famous as DS James Hathaway in TV’s Lewis — was instantly denounced as a “privileged white male” and therefore with no right to an opinion.“Oh, God!” he cried. “I can’t help what I am, I was born like this. It’s an immutable characteristic, so to call me a white privileged male is to be racist.”His landmark moment went viral.Ricky Gervais spoke for the silent majority when he told the Golden Globes nominees “who know nothing about the real world” to tear up their political speeches.But it took the furore over Megxit — and Fox’s unanswerable case for the defence — to trigger Britain’s own fightback.Fox has given a voice to ordinary, decent citizens who are incensed by finger-wagging know-alls smearing them as racists, Nazis and fascists.These ugly insults were hurled at millions who backed Brexit and the overwhelming majority who voted for Boris Johnson.Until now we’ve been too polite to fight back, gagged by Thought Police who bark: “You can’t say that.”So we put up with politically correct sniping from such “identity” obsessives as rapper Stormzy, MP Clive Lewis and the entire Labour Party, who smell racism under every rock.Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan sparked uproar when he challenged black and Asian commentators to produce a “shred of evidence” of Press racism. They failed.Fox’s one-man mission is more than a poke at the PC brigade. It is about free speech — and hypocrisy.Scattergun charges of racism offer an alibi to serious crime, he says, citing the Pakistani sex gangs who systematically raped and trafficked white victims across Britain — with police blessing.“It’s one of the dangerous things about throwing racism around,” the actor told Question Time.“People become so conscious of it that things like the Manchester grooming scandal get ignored.”He spoke as police finally confessed to deliberately turning a blind eye to decades-long vile abuse of vulnerable, underage white girls.A police report confirms a -year reign of sex abuse went unchecked after an unnamed chief inspector ruled: “With it being Asians, we can’t afford for this to be coming out.”Fear of the race card also partly explains why police failed to halt the slaughter of mostly black victims by mostly black kne gangs.The same “cultural cringe” stops prison staff tackling dangerous Islamist gangs who have seized control in Britain’s terror jails.It’s why forced marriage and honour killings go unchecked.Now, at last, black and Asian voices are bravely confronting the race zealots.Leading commentator and ex-Equality Commissioner Trevor Phillips, son of poor immigrants, condemns “feel- good” racism detectorists.“It might make ‘right-on’ white liberals feel better,” he says. “But the price of their smugness is an ongoing bloody massacre of black children.”Home Secretary Priti Patel, daughter of Uganda-Indian migrants, has declared war on the race industry.The BBC strenuously denies “institutional bias”, despite abundant evidence from within the Beeb itself – including from former Director-General Mark Thompson.Now Boris Johnson is in power and the bloated corporation’s £BILLION subsidy is at risk.Perhaps that’s why Question Time is now apparently balanced, Andrew Marr is being polite to Tory guests and on Radio ’s Today, Nick Robinson has gone almost silent.“We live in a great country, a land of opportunity for all,” she said. “Institutionalised, corrosive behaviour that disregards victims has to end.“Tackling this abuse is a priority for the Home Office. There will be no no-go areas.”At last, perhaps, we have a senior politician of colour who is prepared to follow Laurence Fox’s advice and “speak truth to nonsense”.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No Sussex titles to trademark. And no funding of their police guards.If those terms of abdication are proposed and accepted, then we, along with most reasonable British people, will wish Harry and Meghan Wales every happiness in beginning their new lives.A PEERAGE for any one of John Bercow, Karie Murphy or Tom Watson — let alone all three — would be a grotesque insult to the British people.Brexit-blocking former Speaker Bercow stands accused of bullying Commons staff.Murphy, Jeremy Corbyn’s bag-carrier, is being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for allowing anti-Semitism to fester in the Labour Party.And Jezza’s slippery ex-deputy Watson egged on the bungled VIP paedo ring investigation that ruined innocent people’s lives — and cost the taxpayer upwards of £million.The Lords was meant to be a crucial chamber where the wisest in the land could check and amend legislation.But it has mortally damaged its reputation by spending three years trying to thwart Brexit, the biggest democratic mandate in our history.If it now adds any of this trio of scandal-drenched Corbyn nominees to its already bloated ranks, then frankly, it is done for.Boris Johnson is said to be considering moving the House of Lords up to York.If Bercow, Murphy or Watson are to be anywhere near it, we’d rather relocate it to outer Siberia. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

was doing even better than expected, with the Conservatives on a whopping  per cent.Labour are behind on a meagre  per cent, with the Liberal Democrats languishing on just  per cent.In the crucial Christmas election, the Tories received around  per cent of the vote, beating Jeremy Corbyns Labours on  per cent.The poll comes with Britain just  days away from finally leaving the European

with nearly five years to go before another general election isn’t the most predictive exercise but the takeaway from these results are that Boris Johnson has yet to do anything to annoy the erse coalition that gave the Conservatives such a substantial majority in December.“The key factors will be whether or not they are able to deliver a benefit to those traditional Labour voters who backed the Conservatives for the first time in  and whether Labour’s next leader is able to capitalise on any mistakes.”It comes as a Yougov study found the main reason people made the jump from Labour to

ejaculating anxiety every orgasm","story":"The -year-old, who hasnt been identied, told docs he dreaded climaxing because he would suffer flu-like symptoms including anxiety, brain fog and fatigue afterwards.His symptoms, which started as a teenager, were so debilitating he would avoid masturbation and tried not to ejaculate during sex.Medics from Mens Health Boston in Massachusetts explained the bizarre case in a recent article published in Urology Case Reports.They said that his symptoms could be immediate, or delayed by two or three days, and would last between one and two weeks.Dr Jose Bolanos, who treated the man, said: Symptoms began at  years with sexual maturity and continued to the present time, regardless of whether ejaculation occurred via masturbation or intercourse with a female partner.For these reasons he avoided masturbation, and also attempted to avoid ejaculation when engaging in sex with a partner.At the time of presentation he was single and orgasm frequency was once every two to three months.He added that the patients symptoms had affected his work and studies.The man had seen several doctors and researched his symptoms extensively online.He had also attempted ious diets, supplements and allergy tablets without any sort of benefit, the medics noted.Following extensive tests, his symptoms were diagnosed as post-orgasm illness syndrome .The rare disorder is believed to be caused by men having an allergy to their own semen.It is typically reported in males after ejaculation, but in even rarer cases some females have reported similar symptoms.Symptoms can develop within seconds, minutes or hours after orgasm and usually last between for two to seven days before going away on their own.They can y from person to person, but the most common symptoms include:Some scientists believe that in men, it is an autoimmune or allergic disorder that causes an inflammatory reaction to a substance in a man’s own semen.Others have proposed POIS may be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.There is no standard treatment, but some men have been treated with hormone replacement therapy, antihistamines, and or benzodiazepines.POIS can cause severe distress in people with the condition and their partners.Some people with POIS abstain from sexual activity or find that they need to schedule sex for a time when they can cope with the symptoms.Source: GARDDr Bolanos described it as a cluster of bothersome symptoms following ejaculation, which may include severe fatigue, nasal congestion, burning eyes, concentration dficulties, irritability, depressed mood, and a flu-like state.He added that prevalence of the condition is unknown and dficult to determine because its likely that many people with it dont seek medical attention while most doctors are unaware of the syndrome.Due to lack of awareness of POIS as a medical entity, and with its component symptoms of anxiety, distress, and depressed mood, men with POIS may be first referred to a mental health professional, who also may be unfamiliar with this condition, Dr Bolanos added.Following his diagnosis, the man was treated with hormone replacement therapy human chorionic gonadotropin , which he injected three times a week.HCG is the hormone produced during pregnancy, but when injected into men it can stimulate the testicles to produce more testosterone.At his six-week follow-up, the mans symptoms had been completely resolved.He ejaculated more frequently, and experienced no weakness, anxiety, brain fog, or malaise afterwards, the doctor said.He noted improved mood, overall energy, and libido.The patient told medics that it was the first time since he was  that he could experience orgasm without negative physical or emotional consequences afterwards.At his six-month follow-up, he continued treatment and said he was happy, and masturbated several times per month.He still described mild POIS symptoms immediately after orgasm, but said that these resolved within  hours and were not bothersome.Most importantly, he no longer experienced dread with anticipated sexual activity.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make

Hence its shock at last month’s Tory triumph.Hall’s decision to rob over-s of the free licences he agreed to in  was equally outrageous.The idea that the £million cost will harm vital BBC services, when so much of its content amounts to needless competition with commercial rivals, is fatally flawed.His successor must run a smaller Beeb, more in touch with the public, less in the grip of suffocating “wokeness”, focused not on gratuitous expansion but the high-quality shows it does best.This new chief should accept that non-payment of the licence must be decriminalised and the levy finally replaced with a voluntary subscription.Only then will the BBC join the st Century.THE problem with Harry saying he and Meghan had no option but to move abroad to avoid our “powerful media” is that not a word of it is true.It is sheer paranoia to say the Press has done anything but legitimately scrutinise a publicly-funded couple.And the reality is they do not want to avoid media.

Together they could raise enough money to create million jobs in a decadethey just paid .% extra tax. Oxfamaposs British chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah said: “When  men have more wealth than all the women in Africa combined, it’s clear that our economy is just plain sexist. “One way that our upside-down economic system deepens inequality is by chronically undervaluing care work – usually done by women, who are often left little time to get an education, earn a decent living or have a say in how our societies are run, and are therefore trapped in poverty. “If world leaders meeting this week are serious about reducing poverty and inequality, they urgently need to invest in care and other public services that make le easier for those with care responsibilities, and tackle discrimination holding back women and girls.” Oxfam compared the Forbesapos  Billionaires List to the total wealth of all African women aged  and over, including all women, not just the poorest %. Forbesapos list is topped by Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos with a net worth of £bn.  He is followed by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. The top  also includes Facebookaposs Mark Zuckerberg, Googleaposs Sergey Brin and Presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg.  of the  richest people are men.

The charity saidsomeone had saved , a day since Egyptaposs pyramids were built in , BC, they would still only have a fth of the average wealth of the five richest billionaires. Andthe two richest men in the world stacked all their wealth in  bills and sat on it, they would be sitting in outer space. Oxfam said the findings illustrate how inequality continues to be at crisis levels with wealth valued over work and the contribution of women under-rewarded. The report was also published ahead of the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, when some of the worldaposs most wealthy and influential people descend on Davos in Switzerland.It also came as Boris Johnson hosted an African investment summit in London, where the UK announced £m in finance to support UK exports to the continent. Oxfam is urging governments to crack down on tax loopholes and get the richest % to pay extra taxes. It also calls for investments in water and sanitation, electricity, childcare and public healthcare, which they say could save African women signicant time. The charity found that improved water sources in parts of Zimbabwe could save women up to four hours of work a day. And women and girls were putting in . billion hours of unpaid care work every day.

The photo shows how underweight I was - you can see my spine and thin legs. When I ed from Ibiza, my family noticed I looked unhealthy and severely underweight. They were concerned and sat me down for a chat, I began eating a little more but before I knew it - I was occasionally eating and drinking just the milk drink again. I discovered coffee also curbed my hunger pains so I would allow myself to have two cups with milk a day too, Rebecca, from Nottingham, said today.

Bradley Whittle, , left a aposgoodbyeapos voicemail message to his mother and father then stepped in the path of a Virgin train travelling at mph, an inquest heard. Mr Whittle, from Greater Manchester, died at the scene. The footballer had fallen into debt with gambling after suffering with a drug addiction. He referred himself to the charity Addaction and was prescribed antidepressants, but the stress of his gambling debt led him to take an overdose in May last year. His parents questioned whether he should be admitted to a psychiatric hospital but he was discharged from hospital after a -minute assessment at AE. Medics said he should seek help at home. As Mr Whittle, a business administration assistant, spiralled further into his addictions, it impacted his personal and work le. Following the breakdown of a relationship in early , he sought mental health support and despite reassuring clinicians he was doing well, he soon begun talking about ending his own le. Mr Whittles mum, Dianne, told the Bolton hearing: He was seen by the GP and started on the antidepressant Sertraline to treat his depression. But very sadly the antidepressants didnapost really help.  On one occasion towards the end of March, he left a suicide note, so the police were alerted, and he was found and taken to hospital in regards to an overdose. Mr Whittle was also involved in a aposdriving incidentapos and continued to use drugs after a aposwork incidentapos that led to him being suspended. The avid football player had regularly confided in his support workersapos over his substance misuse and personal problems, but never discussed feelings of being suicidal. Michael Brady, a drugs rehabilitation recovery coordinator, said that on one occasion Mr Whittle told him he planned to go for a night out with a friend in Liverpool and would take a drug his parents wouldnapost detect in tests.  My Brady said: He explained he didnapost trust himself not to use a substance. We discussed what would happenhe reported this to the group session and he said they would advice him not to go. He did go, he used g of ketamine and cocaine. Ketamine wasnapost a drug he normally used, he said he started using it as his parents were testing him for cocaine, so they wouldnapost be able to tell he was using ketamine. He added that he never discussed suicide with Mr Whittle, adding he never once reported he was suicidal to me.  He talked openly about his drug use and relationships. He never once mentioned his mental health. Coroner Rachel Syed concluded Mr Whittle had died as a result of suicide, noting heaposd had a normal happy childhood, and had excelled at school and football.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailJeremy Bamber has spoken from his prison cell to again insist he did not murder his family in a ­farmyard ­bloodbath  years ago. And the convicted killer claims new evidence shows there was still le inside the house while he was speaking to dozens of police outside – which he hopes will clear his name. His lawyers say officers did not enter White House Farm where his -year-old parents Nevill and June, sister Sheila Caffell, , and her twins Nicholas and Daniel, six, were ­butchered for nearly four hours, amid fears someone was alive inside, possibly with a gun. Speaking from his cell in Wakefield, West Yorks, Bamber said: “It is the ultimate alibi that I was in the company of dozens of police officers when it was clear that a person or persons were alive in the house who I am convicted of murdering.” He claims schizophrenic Sheila murdered her sons and parents. But author Carol Ann Lee, who exchanged regular letters with Bamber for her book Murders at White House Farm, said she has no doubts about his guilt.  She said the overriding piece of evidence was a gruesome crime scene photograph, which has never been published, which showed the murders were committed by somebody “extremely adept with a gun, who knew what they were doing”. Ms Lee added: “Sheila didn’t, she was also on medication for her illness, which made her unco-ordinated.” Bamber’s girlfriend Julie Mugford also told police he planned the slaughter in a bid to get his hands on the family inheritance and had phoned her, saying: “Tonight’s the night.”The fresh claims from Bamber’s legal team come as the  murders are being portrayed in the ITV drama White House Farm, ­starring Freddie Fox as the mass killer. They will form part of an appeal bid in a submission to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Bamber’s lawyer Mark Newby claims the new evidence is “strong”. Police have always maintained that everyone in the farmhouse at ­Tolleshunt D’Arcy, Essex, was dead by around .am. Bamber lived in nearby Goldhanger. But his legal team say a rle was spotted in an upstairs window by two separate firearms officers at around am on the morning of the murder. And included in the other new evidence is a claim that a  call was made from within the house at .am. Documents seen by the Mirror show a BT operator connected police to an open line at the farm at .am, meaning the handset must have been put back on to make the .am call.  When police eventually broke into the home they heard a noise upstairs, believing it may have been a person. On inspection, everyone was dead. But Bamber’s legal team claim the noise could have been Sheila killing herself. The gun was found on Sheila’s body. Ballistics expert Bruce Jones claimed the . rle used in the ­killings would not have been loud enough for police to “associate its noise with a shot being fired”. Other evidence shows windows at the farm may have been opened after .am and lights turned off between am and am.Mr Newby said: “Because I haven’t received evidence that contradicts it, I can’t necessarily say it isn’t anything other than it was Sheila."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle cradles archie out","story":"NewsMeghan Markle cradles Archie while out hiking as Prince Harry flies over to CanadaMeghan Markle was photographed out walking on Vancouver Island with baby Archie as Prince Harry jetted from the UK to Canada.

With chilly temperatures hitting Vancouver Island, the former Hollywood actress was wrapped up in lots of warm layers and walking boots with Archie secured on her chest in a baby carrier. Two royal protection officers followed close behind as Meghan beamed and her two dogs, black lab Oz and beagle Guy, trotted along beside her in Horth Hill Regional Park.  In the unprecedented images, Meghanaposs face was partially covered under a fawn beanie hat, while her hair hung down in plaits. She also wore black leggings and Kamick ankle-high brown hiking boots, while baby Archie was wearing a white onesie and bootees. Meghan has been setting up temporary home in a £million rented mansion with the plan for her and Harry to settle somewhere in North America, likely Los Angeles.  The prince, meanwhile, left the UK after meeting Prime Minister  Boris Johnson  and world leaders at the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London, which is likely to be one of his few remaining official engagements. Later, brother Prince William hosted the leaders for a dinner at Buckingham Palace, which saw the Duke of Cambridge usher in a new era for The Firm, showcasing the new order post Megxit. Meghan and Harry had been due to attend the event but dropped out after quitting their le as senior royals.  Supported by Kate, as well as Prince Edward and we Sophie, and Princess Anne, he hosted  African delegations, but the Queen and dad Charles were not there. Earlier in the day Harry had held private bilateral meetings with Moroccan PM Saad-Eddine El Othmani Peter Mutharika, President of Malawi and Filipe Nyusi, president of Mozambique at the request of the Government, reports the Mail Online . Harry gave an emotional speech on Sunday night, saying he had no other option but to give up his official royal duties and forge a new le in Canada, where we Meghan and son Archie are setting up home.  Buckingham Palace last night tonight refused to confirm the Duke had fled the UK, saying: “We don’t comment or guide on private schedule.” At a private event for Sentebale on Sunday night in London, Harry spoke about leaving royal duties behind in a bid for a more peaceful le for his family. His comments came after Buckingham Palace released the outcome of talks between the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Harry over the future role of the Sussexes.  Harry and Meghan had wanted to remain as working royals, although not prominent members, and drop their public funding so they could become financially independent - a dual role many commentators said was fraught with problems. In a statement issued on Saturday after royal family talks, the Sussexes announced they will stop carrying out royal duties from the spring, no longer use HRH and will repay the taxpayers millions spent on their Berkshire home. Under the terms of their aposabdicationapos Harry and Meghan will keep their titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the courtesy HRH, but will not use the initials.  Harry was not officially attending the investment summit at a London hotel but was holding one-to-one meetings with a number of foreign leaders at the request of the UK Government. He sat down to talks with Moroccan prime minister Saad-Eddine El Othmani, Malawiaposs President Peter Mutharika, and Filipe Nyusi, president of Mozambique. It is likely the Government asked Harry to meet the African leaders because he has a keen interest in the continent and the royal family employs soft diplomacy to help strengthen Britainaposs ties with her allies.

That had to close when they began dating, but Sussex Royal, their Instagram page, wasn’t too far behind last year, followed by the appointment of a ‘“social media guru”. It was one of the first signs they wanted to strike out independently and control their own brand and message. Now they must earn a living for themselves, social media will be all the more important in building that brand and allow them to reach not only their fans, but key influencers who may help them commercially.

The Queen had insisted his decision must not overshadow senior royals’ high-profile engagements this week. So Harry, , had no option but to agree to the terms set out in front of him, banning him and Meghan from using their HRH titles and forcing him to give up his cherished military roles. Sources close to him say he was “devastated” at the development but felt thathe did not agree, he and we Meghan, , stood to lose even more ground in their bid to leave the royal fold. A palace source said: “It was made abundantly clear to Harry: agree to this and then you can go. By his own admission it was not under the terms he wanted but he had no other option.  “There was no halfway house, no half-in-half-out arrangement, and this was the only one on the table. “Meghan and Harry were so desperate to get out they had no choice – and, on the face of it, it looks like they have given up a considerable amount.” The deal will be reviewed in  months to see how it is working for all parties. Prince Harry was thought to have flown to Canada tonight after he was reportedly spotted at Heathrow Airport on Monday afternoon.  Earlier he attended the UK-Africa Investment summit in London, where he met leaders including Boris Johnson , Moroccan prime minister Saadeddine Othmani, Malawi president Peter Mutharika and Mozambique president Filipe Nyusi, But he did not join the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the plush reception for African leaders at Buckingham Palace tonight. It was the first time William had hosted such an event on behalf of the Queen, signying another major sht as he takes on more responsibilities for the Crown. Prince Charles has a major visit to Israel this week where he will take on official engagements in the country and travel to Palestinian territories for the first time.  He has been invited to speak at the World Holocaust Forum with a select band of world leaders, accepting the honour ahead of the th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will also attend the UK Holocaust Memorial Day Commemorative Ceremony in Westminster next Monday. The Prince of Wales has agreed to fund the Sussexes for a year as they set out to build their independent fortune. But it is not known whether Charles’ support will be funded from the Duchy of Cornwall or his personal wealth. In Canada, Harry will be reunited with Meghan for the first time since she left the UK following the couple’s bombshell announcement on January  that they wanted to step back.  She flew out to rejoin their eight-month-old son Archie within days of their announcement, leaving Harry to face the backlash from his family for defying the Queen’s advice to wait before going public with their decision. The Queen, Charles and William had ordered aides to work round the clock to thrash out a deal for their departure. But the Sussexes’ own plans were shot down and ripped up after the three most senior royals refused to agree to the couple’s cherry-picked propositions. The exit deal allows Harry and Meghan to quit royal le and set up home in Canada – despite huge wrangling over what big-money deals they will be allowed to sign up to, and who will fork out millions for their security.

Calls have been made for the lions to be moved from Khartoumaposs Al-Qureshi Park in Sudan after the pictures show how they have been ravaged by a shortage of food and medicine in the country. Sudan is currently in a worsening economic crisis which has seen food prices soar and a shortage of foreign currency. The park is managed by the governing body in Khartoumy but also funded in part by private donors.Osman Salih, who highlighted the lionsapos plight and launched campaign, posted the images on Facebook saying: After seeing the fires in Australia have killed so many precious creatures recently seeing these animals caged and being treated this way made my blood boil.I was shaken when I saw these lions at the park... their bones are protruding from the skin. I urge interested people and institutions to help them. He added that he was not seeking financial contribution but needed volunteers to help treat the sick lions. Essamelddine Hajjar, a manager at the park, told AFP that workers were dipping into their own pockets to buy food for the animals. In one heartbreaking image a lion is seen slumped on the ground with hundreds of flies on its face. According to park officials and vets, some of the lions have lost almost two-thirds of their body weight due to a deterioration in conditions over the last few weeks. Alarmed locals, volunteers and journalists have flocked to the park to see the lions after the disturbing images of them went viral on social media networks on Sunday.Since then the zoo has received generous donations of fresh meat including two sheep and a regular supply has been arranged from local factories an abbatoirs.  The lions are also being given fluids through a drip to tackle their dehydration. However on Monday afternoon Osman announced on Facebook that one a lioness had died.

Picking up on the ball in the middle of the Partick half, he drove forward and slipped in Glass.The United kid#s cross-cum-shot found Adrian Sporle with the simplest of tasks to tap home unopposed for his first league goal for the club.After a frenetic first period, the second  took a while to get going but it was Ian McCall#s side on the front foot.Just before the hour-mark, the impressive Reece Cole made a powerful run into the box before his effort won the Jags a corner.However, it was United who got the scoring under way in the second half and took control with the first chance of note in the period.And it was that man Shankland again as he went on a terric -yard solo run into the Partick box before calmly slotting beyond Fox for his second of the afternoon and the Terrors# third.Peter Pawlett completed his comeback from injury on  minutes when he replaced Paul Watson.And, just a minute later, his first involvement in the game was to tee up Shankland for his third, completing a perfect hat-trick by thundering a left-foot drive into the top corner to send the ,-strong visiting support wild.One of few worries for United on the afternoon came on  minutes when Clark had to limp off injured, to be replaced by Adam King.Miller netted a late consolation for Thistle on  minutes but Robbie Neilson#s men took all the points and another step towards sealing the title.Partick Thistle XI : FoxWilliamson , Saunders, O#Ware , Penrice Cardle , Bannigan, Cole, Zanatta Jones , Miller.Subs not used: Sneddon , Harkins, Slater and Mansell.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson , Connolly, ReynoldsPowers Appere, Glass , Clark , Sporle Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sow, Stanton and Freeman.Referee: Willie Collum.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/fd8d9b42-0677-43bf-8491-5fac63db87ee-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/fd8d9b42-0677-43bf-8491-5fac63db87ee-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/fd8d9b42-0677-43bf-8491-5fac63db87ee-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/fd8d9b42-0677-43bf-8491-5fac63db87ee-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"poll how many times do you have to ring to get through to your local surgery","story":"Last September, the Tele reported the concerns of one woman who said it was #virtually impossible# to be seen by a doctor at Broughty Ferry Health Centre.The woman, who did not want to be named, said people are waiting outside as early as .am to try to see a doctor when the surgery opens at am.In tomorrow#s Tele, we will be running an article on a similar issue.Many people have come forward to express their frustration at the amount of phone calls they#re having to make each morning in order to secure an appointment # and how long they#re having to wait to be connected.So, we ask you: How many times do you have to ring to get through to your local surgery "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.16081693-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.16081693-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.16081693-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.16081693-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"woman caused cops needless anxiety by repeatedly dialling 999","story":"Sentence has been further deferred on a Menzieshill woman who caused police officers “needless anxiety” by persistently dialling .Deborah Keith, of Leith Walk, pled guilty to making multiple phone calls on August .

building warrant was submitted in September to demolish buildings at the site including the main arena, which has now been approved by the local authority.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said now the building warrant has been granted, the “intention” would be for that work to start “immediately”.He added: “That might include internal works first which people won’t be able to see.”As well as the removal of the old main arena building, the covered walkway that connects to the section of the conference centre next to the Holiday Inn Express will also be removed.It is expected that the value of the work to be undertaken will be around £,.The warrant has an expiry date of January   and all work must be completed by then.It is understood that the remaining conference centre will be retained as well as the nearby park-and-ride facility.Talks regarding the future use of the site are still ongoing.Plans were previously submitted to the local authority by developers Henry Boot in May  for the land, which hoped to create a mixed use development including approximately  residential units, properties for commercial and business use, a recycling centre and park-and-ride facility.The application is still pending and there was a number of documents uploaded on to the site in , along with a letter of objection received last year.It stated: “The site would have been better used as a new north-east HQ and training hub for Police Scotland with Queen Street being disposed of.“There would be ample space to create a specialist training facility, which Police Scotland does not have anywhere north of the central belt.”Discussions have also been under way with the King’s Community Church over the site, with the church keen to move from its base on King Street.The church began in  with a small gathering before it moved to the city centre church in  where it has remained.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “A building warrant to demolish the

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

fire that destroyed a large part of the building last year.The replacement secondary, though, will take at least three years to build.But according to Scottish Borders Councilrsquos Chief Executive Tracey Logan, it is the only way forward for Peebles High.Although it is yet to be officially endorsed by the local authority, Ms Logan says her view is that apart from the Sports Complex and Millennium Wing, the entire school will be demolished and rebuilt.And that Peebles High will jump to the head of the queue in the rebuilding programme of schools - ahead of Galashiels, Hawick and Selkirk.But the Chief Executive told the towns Community Council she thinks Peebles should now be first on the priority list for a new school.Ms Logan explained: ldquoAt the moment my view is, and this is only my view, this has not even endorsed by the Council as yet, is that given the constraints that we have around what will be available financially, the Scottish Government have been really helpful in that they are offering their full support and we will make a bid late spring for funding through the schools programme.ldquoThere will obviously be a financial settlement from the insurance.\"But we need to find the best way forward, so my expectation is that we will retain the Sports Complex because it is undamaged and pretty new, we will also retain the Millennium Wing because again itrsquos not that old and is entirely usable.ldquoI would imagine that we will probably end up taking away everything  and replace it with something new.\"What that will look like, I have no idea. But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive. I absolutely acknowledge that itrsquos not perfect but it has done the job we needed it do to.Senior students are currently sitting prelim exams in the Sports Complex and this will continue until the end of January.Temporary classroom units are being erected within the school grounds and pupils are to be accommodated in unaffected areas of the building.ldquoThere are still huge amounts of work going on and we will go right up to the wire but Irsquom confident we will achieve it, added Ms Logan.The Council has decided on a phased approach with S to S students starting on Monday, February  and S to S working from home and ing the following day.Ms Logan said that there has been ldquocompromises in the education offer over the last few weeks but is assuring parents that from the beginning of February it will be ldquobusiness as usual.Demolition work on the damaged building has been completed and restricted access has been implemented.The council boss has assured parents that children will only be able to access safe routes throughout the school building.Ms Logan added: ldquoOne of the things we did lose in the fire was the vast majority of pupil toilets so what wersquove now got on site is the long term temporary arrangements supplemented over the course of January.To ensure pupil safety, traffic will enter the site from a new access via Craigerne Road located at the back of the school.Ms Logan is meeting with insurers this week to discuss a settlement figure which will help form the direction of the future of Peebles High School.She added: ldquoAll of what we are doing is going to be sustainable for whatever we do in terms of the proper rebuild.\"What Irsquom trying to reassure you is that wersquore not doing things that are very temporary, whatever we do, we will be looking to the future.Community councillor Graham Mackie commended the local authority on doing a ldquoremarkable job and said any criticism of the Council during this trying time was unnecessary.He said: ldquoIt has been thought for several years that we needed a completely new high school but possibly therersquos a silver lining here in that we can end up with a high school that will meet the needs of the current population.\"But the council chief told members that ldquoessentially this is the replacement.She explained: ldquoWhen it comes to looking at high schools and replacement we would always look to retain what is still workable.\"In the case of the bits we are talking about in terms of Peebles High site they are really not that old. The Millennium Wing meets the standards that would be required in a new building. There would be very little point in wasting money knocking down something that works really well. It will be a modern fit for the future school."},{"url":null,"title":"work-start-three-new-social-housing-developments","story":"BOSSES at Scottish Borders Housing Association have announced that work

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know.

A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman.

So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did.

Johnson canrsquot stand against the peoplersquos will indefinitely, he averred. But he gave no suggestion of any kind of action, legal or otherwise.This is because his boss, Nicola Sturgeon, is committed to the Section  order. This means recognising that the UK Parliament is sovereign and asking the PM to transfer power to Holyrood to hold a legally binding referendum.This is the only way, she says, to put the result ldquobeyond legal dispute. And more importantly to ensure that the referendum is recognised by other countries, in particular, the EU.Most legal folk, from the prolic law lecturer Andrew Tickell to the constitutional law expert Professor Aileen McHarg ndash both sympathetic to the nationalist cause ndash agree with the First Minister.As McHarg puts it: ldquoThere is no legal shortcut to independence. Tickell says it would be a waste of money mounting hopeless court actions. But now OrsquoNeill has thrown a hand grenade into what was an arcane dispute.Financed by the Forward As One group, this senior advocatersquos considered view is that the Scottish Government already possesses the power to call a consultative referendum. He thinks the matter should be tested in the Court of Session and thinks that judges might issue a ldquodeclarator. The implication is thatthe Scottish Government has a will, it could find a legal way.Now, it may be that the Scottish Parliament has the power, in the abstract, to hold referendums. Holyrood could have binding referendums on all manner of things: smacking, speed limits, hospital charges.Anything that is within the powers of the Scottish Parliament, in fact.But the point is that the constitution is not among the powers of the Scottish Parliament. It can stage a ballot, but what it canrsquot do is force Westminster, ie Boris Johnson, to honour the result of it. At least that is the majority view.:Kevin McKenna: Strategy, not lines in the sand, will set Scotland freeUnder the last Parliament, there might have been a slim chance that the opposition parties could have ganged up to force the PMrsquos hand. They might have passed a Benn Act instructing the Government to honour a Scottish referendum result. But Boris Johnson now has an -seat majority, so therersquos not a cat in hellrsquos chance that Westminster would agree to Scotland seceding from the Union. Which raises the question of what to do next.Alex Neil, the former Scottish minister, says Sturgeon should press ahead anyway. So whatWestminster ignores the referendum result, he says. It would stand as a measure of the Scottish peoplersquos will. ldquoThe political argument would be, he said on BBC radio, ldquowersquove won.It is going to be very dficult for the First Minister to disagree. But that is probably what shersquoll do. Her argument has anyway changed recently. She is not actually arguing for an immediate referendum any more, but for Holyrood to be given the power to call a referendum in future.That is harder for Boris Johnson to reject, but reject it he has. No referendum for now or in the foreseeable future. Do your worst. Itrsquos not going to happen.If Sturgeon takes the OrsquoNeill advice and holds a consultative referendum, the UK Government will reject it as invalid. The non-nationalist parties will advise unionists to boycott it, as unionists did in the  Catalonian referendum. This would fatally undermine its legitimacy.Nationalists might say: a result is a result. Why bother about people who wonrsquot vote  What about the force of democratic opinion  But it is naiumlve to believe that Westminster parties will respond positively to any unauthorised referendum.Earlier this week, Lisa Nandy, one of the leading Labour leadership contenders, told The Andrew Neil Show that the UK should look to Catalonia for lessons on how to beat ldquoisive nationalism.We are assured that Nandy did not mean that riot policy should be used against peaceful demonstrators or that elected Scottish politicians should be locked up. But it was still an astonishing remark.:Alistair Grant: Scotlands endless Indyref Groundhog Day is going nowhere fastPost-Brexit, metropolitan attitudes have hardened markedly against independence and ldquoisive nationalism. Nicola Sturgeon will eventually have to recognise that the Westminster route to independence is barred for the foreseeable future.The precedent of the  Edinburgh Agreement will not necessarily be recognised following Brexit. Britainrsquos departure from the EU has changed the game.In , no-one thought the UK would be leaving the EU. Scotland and England would be remaining in the European Single Market and the Customs Union even after independence. Not any more. There would now be the question of a hard border at Gretna.But more importantly, the Global Britain project would be fatally damagedthe UK were to lose one-third of its landmass, most of its hydrocarbons and all its nuclear weapons. Itrsquos just not gonna happen. We are in a dferent era.The UK state can no longer afford to endorse Scotlandrsquos departure from the Union. Even Labour is now locking the door. This means there is not going to be a legal indyref, possibly for a very long time. Not after , probably not after .Brexit Britain will not let Scotland go, unless there is overwhelming support for independence, which frankly there isnrsquot. Nicola Sturgeon may insist that the will of the people will triumph in the end. That there is no point in holding referendums that donrsquot mean anything.But she canrsquot in all honestly keep telling her troops that indyref is round the corner.

Thompson was on The Andrew Marr Show yesterday. He was deemed such a VIP the producers showed footage of him arriving at New Broadcasting House in London, an honour usually reserved for visiting Prime Ministers and the like. Not that you would confuse Mr Thompson with a politician: the Starbucks coffee cup marked him out as an easy like Sunday morning meeja type.: Unionist boycott should not invalidate voteMarr began by flattering his former boss. When Thompson arrived at the NYT it was an old fashioned news empire in pretty ropey shape, he said, ldquoa classic case of the inevitable decline of the mainstream media. But Thompson had turned things around, doubling revenue and attracting five million subscribers. How Three things, said Thompson. First, they took on  more journalists to boost content. ldquoIf you can be dferent, and this in a way is the Netflix tactic, pour money into content, make great content, then yoursquoll get customers. Next, more hiring: this time of software engineers. Third, the running of the main print paper was given over to a handful of people.With the Sunday papers full of Harry and Meghan leaving the UK to spend most of their time in North America, Thompson was askedthe couple could expect a quieter time from the media there. ldquoMuch of the American press is much more high-minded than the British press, he said, showing he has not lost the ability, common in BBC director generals, of getting right up the noses of the red tops.Thompson was visiting just as the BBC is living through another period of interesting times. There were murmurings from the Conservatives during the General Election about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee and forcing the BBC not to scrap free TV licences for the over-s. Now the party has a large majority it is in a position to make its threats real.: Question Time row rumbles onDecriminalising would cost the BBC pound-pound million, Thompson estimated. Something  was going on, he feared. ldquoI worry that decriminalisation is a de facto beginning of the abolition of the licence fee but without the courage to say that, and put it out to the public to say whether or not they want a properly funded BBC or not.As for scrapping free licences for the over-s, Thompson recalled the same idea being put to him by the Coalition Government. ldquoThey came with a drop dead, wersquore going to do this, back in .Thompson walked out of the meeting and got on the train home to Oxford. On the way he started to mentally compose his resignation letter.The phone went: it was Jeremy Hunt, then Culture Secretary, asking him toand continue talking.Years later, when the Conservatives won a majority on their own, the Chancellor behind the first proposal, George Osborne, came calling again. This time he got his way. By then, Thompson was in New York.Back to the present day and talk of the future. The BBC, like all ldquolegacy media had to attract a younger audience, said Thompson. ldquoIf we donrsquot radically change and start thinking about the audience of the future the risk is we age out with a given generation of people and we all are beaten by companies like Netflix.Commercial media in the UK, like in most European countries, was in ldquoreal trouble, said Thompson, with local journalism in danger of disappearing. If you were waiting to hear him tackled on the BBCrsquos part in commercial mediarsquos woes, hard luck.: How local is your MPThompsonrsquos time at the head of the BBC coincided not just with introducing ratings giants such as Strictly Come Dancing and Sherlock, and presiding over successes such as the iPlayer. Under his watch the BBC used public money, the licence fee, to fund a massive expansion into digital, taking readers and advertisers from local papers. Yet there was no reference to this, which was disappointing from Marr, who started out in Scottish papers.Nor was there specic mention of Scotland. Instead, Thompson mused about how the BBC could help the government. ldquoWhen I listen to the new prime minister talking about his plans to really get serious about investing in the Midlands and the north, and to start projecting this countryrsquos talent, ideas, its potential to the entire world, I think of the BBC and Channel  as potentially great allies in that.Doubtless Channel , whose flagship news show, like the Today programme, is being frozen out by Downing Street, will have something to say about that."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Megxit - the scary post-Brexit home truths","story":"Clearly, Harry and Meghan arenrsquot so much stepping back from royal le as checking out completely, with a flick of the Vs that could be taken to signy peace, victory or what those of us fluent in Parliamo Glasgow would recognise as ldquoget it up ye.:Harry and Meghan will not use HRH titles or get royal funds - palaceSafe to say I wonrsquot be spending too much time fretting over the future happiness of this super-rich celebrity couple.

Advocates of ldquonew Scottish politics often promised that a new Scottish Parliament would broaden recruitment, notably to increase the proportion of women, but also to become more representative in relation to class, ethnicity, education, and former careers.Such reforms are left to inidual political parties, such as when Labour traditionally led the way in the recruitment of women. There is no institutional provision for ersity. As a result, following a brief honeymoon period after devolution, we have not really seen a major ergence in social backgrounds between MSPs and MPs.Rather, there has been a tendency towards convergence, in which roughly one-third of elected representatives are women and the vast majority have attended university.In some respects, Scotland has lagged behind Westminster, since almost all parliamentary representatives in Scotland are white. The main dferences have to do with the dferent party balance between Westminster and Holyrood.here are fewer privately educated politicians in Scotland, and few are graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, with Glasgow University being the largest source of recruitment. That, however, was true of Scottish MPs before devolution.As to occupation, MPs in Scotland are not remarkably dferent from their counterparts across the rest of the UK. In the post-war decades, Scottish Labour recruited more MPs from the old blue-collar working class occupations and the Conservatives more from aristocrats and landowners than their counterparts in England.Amongst MSPs, this has been reversed, with a common middle class background predominating. Many such occupations ndash such as in law or education ndash were once described as ldquopolitics facilitating because they offered the skills or connections conducive to seeking election.Now, the main focus is on the occupations that may be used as a stepping stone towards elected office, such as MP and party assistants, members of think tanks or interest groups sympathetic to particular parties, and work in public relations or the media, close the political centre. These jobs support potential candidates until they are elected, since candidacy is an increasingly time-consuming task. In many cases, the jobs also help them become elected because they give them essential links to party recruitment. An even smaller pool, from jobs related directly to Westminster or government, may help newly elected MPs achieve rapid promotion within their parties. The proportion of candidates in these jobs, ldquoinstrumental to elected office, are dficult to identy precisely, but we tend to find that somewhere between one-third and one-half of MPs and MSPs have held a job that acts as a source of income and stepping stone to candidacy. Overall, there is a ldquopolitical class in Scotland just as there is a ldquopolitical class in London.It is dficult to come to too many conclusions about how worrying these trends should be, for three main reasons.First, in their book The Good Politician, Nick Clarke and colleagues show that most electors are more interested in more general indicators of MP trustworthiness. They seek ldquohonest, ldquosincere, and ldquogenuine politicians with a grasp of ldquoeveryday le and in touch with ldquoordinary people. A tendency to recruit from the same small proportion of the population seems to undermine the chance that Westminster politicians engage in ldquoordinary le, but it does not undermine their honesty and sincerity.Second, there can be unintended consequences to a too-ambitious shopping list of reforms to the political class. For example, in their article The Politics of Local Presence, Sarah Childs and Philip Cowley suggest thatthe insistence on a local candidate can overshadow attempts to secure more women or people of colour in elected positions.Third, electors want politicians who share their beliefs, and are committed to turning those beliefs into policy. During periods of fierce competition on constitutional and other issues, these beliefs seem to trump shared backgrounds.Electors seem to trust their politiciansthey want the same things, and distrust themthey donrsquot.Michael Keating is Professor of Politics, University of Aberdeen, and Director, Centre on Constitutional Change.l Paul Cairney is Professor of Politics and Public Policy, University of Stirling."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10914517.jpg?type=article-full","title":"former-glasgow-rbs-building-set-demolition-pave-way-new-hotel","story":"Plans were approved for a hotel on the Dale House site, West George Street, almost two years ago.

It does no good. They are out for the afternoon, they are going to make a loud and long fuss over a Capri Sun and they are going to keep talking about their hunger levels for the entire performance.Its not long before another woman brings her mobile phone out and starts taking photographs of the stage.A trip to the cinema long ago became an interesting gamble to see, notsomeone would talk all the way through the film, but how many people would talk all the way through the film.There should be a points system devised to at least make a fun game out of what is a rotten situation. Only one point for talking as its hardly worth mentioning now. Two points for checking the time on their brightly lit mobile phone. Three points for checking Facebook or searching a website.Four points for taking a phone call during the movie. And five points for taking a selfie with the flash on.I earned  points at a screening of Its a Wonderful Le a few days before Christmas. I believe people have, generally, become more inconsiderate as going out to the cinema has become cheaper. Cinema loyalty cards are a brilliant idea but, when youre not physically handing over cash for a ticket, it feels less important an experience. Folk behave as though theyre in their living rooms.\"Do you want some of this flask of tea \" called one of a family of six along the row behind us at Its A Wonderful Le. There was lots of chat in reply about said flask. The two youngest members of the family talked incessantly about nothing. Two older women with them were similarly having a right old chinwag. My friend asked the two younger ones to please be quiet. They ignored the request and kept going.\"Shut up!\" shouted someone from along the row. I cracked towards the end of the film and askedthey could please, please be quiet for just five minutes. \"Well try two and see how we get on,\" said the older woman, sarcastically, as the young adults sniggered. \"So rude,\" snapped the other older woman, to me. Its meant to be a nicer crowd at the Glasgow Film Theatre but standards have clearly slipped.The two women spent the last minutes of the film having a bellowing sing-a-long. It was bonkers but bog standard cinema behaviour.Back to the theatre though, and I was gutted at the ballet being utterly ruined.Ballet is not an art form thats for everyone. But even with bored children - and I do sympathise - its a good le lesson to learn to sit politely and be aware of your impact on other people. Its brilliant to get children interested and involved in the theatre but its one thing to be talking about the performance and another to just chat away like youre in your house.Its time to take a stand rather than just moaning about it after the fact. Complain, complain, complain to venues as the inconsiderate behaviour is happening.Venues: Can we have ushers, please  If people cant behave then they need babysat. And take a one strike approach. One complaint and youre out.Theatre and the cinema are secular churches, places where we gather together socially to think about about society, culture, experiences other than our own.

Water slides have been erected in other cities across the world, including in Bristol.As with other city frameworks, the Blythswood plan includes cutting down on the number of cars, creating ldquoedge of city centre parking along the M corridor and enhancing pedestrian and cycling routes.It states candidate sites formulti-storey car parking are adjacent to Anderston Station, off the M and Clydeside Expressway, to serve thecity centre, Anderston Station andSEC Hydro and over the M, north of Sauchiehall Street.The possibility of turning more rooftops into green spaces should be investigated, the report adds.Work on Blythswood Court, described as a ldquobadly integrated, unattractive s structure with lots of vacant spaces, is a priority.In the short term, the report suggests the empty spaces ldquoshould be programmed with s thatenliven the complex, such as start-up businesses, day care, non-profit organisations and artistsrsquo studios.However, longer term ldquothe proposal is to radically restructure the lower levels of the building, or possibly completely redevelop the complex.Buildings such as Alexander ldquoGreek Thomsonrsquos St Vincent Street Church and the Mitchell Library, which is ldquoblighted by the M, warrant ldquospecial care and attention.There are also plans to re-populate Blythswood by adapting and re-using upper floors, re-purposing Georgian townhouses and providing a mix of housing for students, young professionals, families and elderly people.Meanwhile, the George Square plans would involve the site becoming car-free, with two sides closed to all traffic.The proposal would see the east side of the square outside the City Chambers and the opposite end at Merchants House fully shypedestrianised, with the two longer sides used for buses, taxis, private hires and cycles only, between am and pm.The first changes,approved, which remove all parking spaces around the square, are planned to be in place by this summer.The idea is to make some changes before the European Championship football matches at Hampden Park in June and remove all the parking spaces currently around three sides of the square, creating more space for people.The council carried out a consultation exercise last year asking shypeople what they wanted the square to be used for and what changes they would like to see to improve the square.The findings from the consultation, which had more than , responses, included a reduction in traffic or an element of pedestrianisation, a more sustainable green space and a place to sit or relax.The estimated cost for the proposed George Square works is between poundmillion to poundm. This will be met from existing capital budgets, including the Glasgow City Region City Deal.Ms Aitken, said: ldquoThe consultation findings echo what our citizens routinely tell us, that something clearly has to change with George Square. Irsquom really encouraged there is consensus on many key shyelements.ldquoThe public conversations we have facilitated tell us our people wanta greener square with less traffic,a space of high-design quality and which continues toas it traditionally has done, as a space for Glaswegiansto gather.

Nine times out of  its celebrity list is an archetypal poster person of the morally superior left, so when they have someone on who is not, it makes their comments all the more interesting.I chuckled at his answer on his climate footprint, albeit I am certain it will be lost on the colleagues he mocked. But it was his exchange with Rachel Boyle, a lecturer in race ethnicity, on the media treatment of the Duchess which captured the headlines and provoked mass Twitter hysteria.Foxrsquos comments deserve a calmer airing. He is saying thatsomeone shouts racism the decent amongst us are increasingly expected to accept it and stay quiet.White people donrsquot understand racism, so shut up about it. But where does that get us, in the end, other than to the point where certain people are effectively prohibited from talking about certain issues in polite society I confess that I thought twice about choosing this topic for this column for precisely that reason. It will give me nothing but trouble. Irsquoll get tweets and emails which wonrsquot be nice to read, and for which a thick skin will be required.However, I canrsquot accept that here in Britain, which has spread freedom of speech all over the world, we should be fearful of practising it ourselves.In truth, I donrsquot knowBritain is a racist country. I instinctively recognise Britain as a global leader in tolerance and integration, but self-criticism is integral to ensuring that it doesnrsquot become complacent.I suppose it depends on onersquos definition. Are there racists  Of course, but that would make every country in the world racist by definition, and there is a good argument to be made that the digital loudspeaker of social media has brought into public the behaviour that was always taking place amongst a small minority in private.But those people are the lowest of our society, and Irsquom not sure we can label our country according to their behaviour. So is there, then, racist-enabling behaviour by people who should know better  Yes, and of course the oft-quoted example is Boris Johnsonrsquos ldquoletter-boxes description of Muslim women wearing the Niqab. I do not think that the Prime Minister is racist, but I do think that people in a lofty position need to understand the effect that their language could have on the way others behave.What we are insinuating in the case of the Duchess, though, is altogether dferent. We are saying that Britain is an institutionally racist country. With that I confess, I have some trouble.In deconstructing her media coverage, there are elements of no doubt and elements of doubt.It is of no doubt that her coverage has, since her wedding, been diametrically opposed to that of her sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge. Thatrsquos perfectly obvious, and those who hold up a mirror to the sympathetic ndash some might say sycophantic ndash coverage Kate received when she ldquolovingly cradled her baby bump, comparing it to the ldquowhy canrsquot Meghan stop touching her bump  headlines are correct. There is no shortage of other examples.That the coverage is dferent is in no doubt. But, surely, we are capable of having a deeper and calmer conversation about why the coverage is dferent. Because we have jumped a step here. We have said the headlines are dferent , ergo the British press is racist . We have not analysed why the coverage is dferent .Now, it is imperative that as part of our considerations of step two we include race. Becausethe Duchess of Sussexrsquos media coverage is dferent to that of the Duchess of Cambridge because of her race, then that is a matter of national seriousness which would require a seismic response.Butit is not because of that ndashit is for entirely unrelated reasons ndash then it is dangerous for us to blindly accept that it is.What other reasons might there be Well, let us remember that when the relationship began her media coverage was excellent indeed it was seen universally as being a welcome development that Harry was in a relationship with a person of mixed race.But the press then began to believe that Meghan Markle is not a royalist. Right or wrong, they now see someone who doesnrsquot love or respect the traditions of the Royal Family, who doesnrsquot enjoy her role within it, who doesnrsquot relish being an understudy to the more senior members of it, and who acts out the ldquoDuchess Dficult persona in reality.For the record, I am not a Royalist either. Although Irsquom not hugely exercised by the existence of the Royals or their role in our constitution, I am a republican. Butthere is one thing around which the British press unites it is its Royalism. So perhaps it is little wonder it takes a dimmer view of the Duchess of Sussex than it does of the Duchess of Cambridge.And herersquos the critical point. If that is why the press treats her badly, then that may be unfair, but it is not racist because it has nothing to do with her race. When the Duchess of Cornwall, for instance, endured years, decades, of negative coverage, self-evidently nobody suspected the press had a race issue.I know the press Irsquove worked with them for the best part of two decades. I need to be persuaded that journalists and headline writers have Meghan Marklersquos skin colour in their minds when they are writing about her.ButI am wrong, then letrsquos hear it. Letrsquos talk about it. Calmly. Letrsquos see evidence. If I canrsquot spot discrimination because Irsquom not subject to it, I need to know how to do better.

Rationing also generated thousands of enquiries, and bureaux persuaded the government to grant extra clothes coupons to pregnant women. The first CABs in  were in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Stirling and Dundee.Post-war period: Against expectations, the end of the war brought an increased demand. CABs dealt with more enquiries than at the height of the blitz. Housing problems and family breakdowns increased. To meet this demand, the number of CABs began to prolerate.The advent of Legal Aid and the NHS led to a surge in enquiries.s: Housing problems continued to grow as people struggled with the housing shortage, overcrowding, and the end of rent controls.Hire purchase promised le on the ‘never-never.’ For many this led to mounting debts.s: Rents were rocketing, yet many people were still living in slum conditions and homelessness was rising. By  housing problems accounted for a quarter of the . million problems dealt with by CABs across the UK.Divorce reform too led to a surge in enquiries, with family problems representing  per cent of the CAB workload.s: Family, housing and benefit problems remained the top priority, but the consumer boom saw personal debt soar too. Industrial change saw an increase in redundancies and workers’ rights issues.s: Consumerism brought with it two recessions and debt and benefit cases doubled. Employment enquiries rose by  per cent. But debt, stemming from easy credit, became the biggest CAB issue.s: Social security became the top issue and sharp rises in VAT didn’t help.

He’s now long gone but I’ll never forget him.”Sharon has witnessed many changes over the years and longs for the day when people finally stop being cruel to their animals.However, she knows that, until that day, the SSPCA will be there to help them.She added: “Behind every animal, there’s a human story too.“The biggest problem, other than cruelty cases, that we see is people with mental health issues.“They love their animals but maybe start with a pregnant cat, keep all the kittens and then end up with  or  in their home.“They can’t bear to be parted with them and end up in a dficult situation.“It’s heart-breaking to hear some of those human stories but, at the end of the day, we are here to look after the animals.“Over the years, I’ve seen thousands and thousands of animals who have been nursed back to good health and rehomed.“I’m really, really lucky. Not many people can say they’ve worked in their dream job for  years but I still wake up every day and feel blessed.”SSPCA could not operate without generosity of the publicToday, the SSPCA has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle rescue centre at Fishcross in Clackmannanshire.The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work. The public funds the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team at its centres across Scotland and its wildle sanctuary. The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children through its educational programmes.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.To find out more or donate, visit www.scottishspca.org."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish charity worker surpasses his 50 000 running home target","story":"Even Mark Calder wasn#t surehe#d be able to pull off his mammoth  challenge. In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Zimeng with piano teacher Sister Avril and trustee Maggie Picken.\"  Fe charity marks  years helping blind people viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"“I was invited to speak in venues I would never have been able to reach in my day job, Iona Abbey being one.“It was a fantastic way to spread the word about Embrace the Middle East.“I look back on it not with a sense of pride, but rather relief – and gratitude for the people and places I encountered along the way.”Divine inspiration also came from a meeting with Father Emanuel Youkhana, a Christian minister who works in Dohuk in Iraq to bring Christians, Muslims and Yazidis together.Mark said: “To see his energy and enthusiasm for what we were doing was a massive inspiration.“That was at the end of Run , the St Ninian run, when I was at my most tired.“To have that intervention made a really big dference.”That particular run had loomed large in Mark’s mind it was the equivalent of running three marathons each day for seven days.Remarkably, though, he only lost one day to ill-health throughout the year.“I’ve learned that your body can adapt to whatever is thrown at it,” said Mark.“I wasn’t sureI’d be able to make it to the end of that run but when I hobbled over the finish line, that’s when I knew I could do it.”The darkest day of the challenge was undoubtedly in June during the St Columba run from Inchcolm Abbey to Iona Abbey.“It was one of the most interesting runs in terms of scenery, with just about every landscape Scotland has to offer,” he said.“There was a long, unsupported section just north of Oban. I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

Currently, it supports communities in northern Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. Mark said: “Our focus is enabling people to rebuild their livelihoods. We do that by offering skills training in everything from computer skills to bee keeping. That one struck me as odd but it turns out everyone loves honey!“Embrace the Middle East also supports intercommunal peace building. The charity is led by local partners and shows how changes, big and small, can make a dference.”While many Iraqi citizens have chosen not toto their homeland, Embrace is there to help those who do.Mark added: “Their homes and agricultural land have been damaged. Our focus is future-proofing their ability to stay in their communities.“We’re not an NGO which is there for a short-term fix – we are there for the long term.”As well as working for Embrace the Middle East three days a week, Mark is an honorary fellow at Aberdeen University and has also taught social sciences at Stirling and Durham Universities."},{"url":null,"title":"spectacular year of firsts for snh","story":" was a spectacular year for Scottish Natural Heritage#snature reserves, including Forvie.At Forvie, the UK’s oldest ever arctic tern was found: first ringed as a chick at Buddon Ness in Angus, the tern was discovered at the SNH nature reserve in Aberdeenshire and found to be  years old, almost to the day.An average tern lives for only about  years.Forvie also celebrated the grand achievement of  years as a national nature reserve this year.The reserve is one of Scotland’s natural treasures, a place of stark beauty.Covering almost , hectares, it is part of one of the most extensive sand dune systems in Britain and a haven for wildle like breeding eider ducks, four species of terns, many waders and wildfowl, as well as grey seals.For SNH  also included the first-ever black grouse displaying at Beinn Eighe a flowering of aspen trees at Muir of Dinnet for the first time in almost  years a fth record-breaking year for visitors to the Isle of May and , walkers, cyclists and runners flocking to Loch Leven.Black grouse are an endangered species, so their first-time appearance at Beinn Eighe- Scotland’s oldest national nature reserve-this spring was a signicant sign of how the species is faring in the area.The year got off to a remarkable start at Muir of Dinnet in early March with the flowering of aspen trees –the first time since  for a large-scale aspen flowering in Scotland.Stuart MacQuarrie, SNH’s Head of Nature Reserves, said: “Scotland’s national nature reserves are special places for wildle.“But they are also wonderful spots to visit, enjoy a spectacular view and catch sight of an elusive otter or amazing eagle.“Making sure our nature is thriving is also part of the solution to the climate emergency.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial. We must give a voice to our local producers in these trade talks while we still can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We found seven sites breaking European or Scottish standards designed to protect health. The overall the picture hasn’t changed much, with some sites showing an increase and some showing a decrease.It is perhaps too early to see the impact of the Low Emission Zonein Glasgow, with no clear picture from the measurements across the city and Hope Street still the most polluted street in Scotland.Our number crunching is based on the official air pollution data produced by fixed, automatic monitoring stations. This network is rather sparse so many councils carry out more detailed monitoring from time to time, which means there are actually many more sites which fail the standards around Scotland. These results show there are still  official pollution zones across Scotland, in  of our  local council areas.: Edinburgh roads named among Scotland’s most polluted streets: York to ban ‘non-essential’ private car journeys in city centre by  to cut carbon emissionsLast year was the first year of Glasgow’s LEZ and it required only a very slight improvement in the emissions from buses in the city centre, but this year a much more signicant improvement is specied, meaning we should see a real improvement in the  pollution levels. However, evenevery bus were emissions-free this would still not be enough to meet standards everywhere, so the LEZ will be extended to taxi, lorries and cars over the next few years.Data reveals main culpritsThere will also be LEZs in Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh from the end of this year. The proposals so far are a pretty mixed bag, with Dundee planning not to include its most polluted street in its zone and Edinburgh proposing a complex two-tier plan which is in danger of displacing city centre pollution into streets further out.Six of the seven sites which fail do so because levels of nitrogen dioxide are too high. The seventh fails because levels of small particles are too high. This is Salamander Street in Edinburgh. When the people who analyse the data do a review each year they often decide the final average for the year for this site is slightly lower than the provisional figures we are working from, so it is possible that Salamander Street will go from a bit over the standard to slightly under. Either way, and annoyingly for me, this is just round the corner from where I live.There have been several sources suggested for the high levels of small particle pollution at Salamander Street. It is the closest monitoring site to the sea and sea spray throws off fine particles. There has been, and will continue to be, lots of building work in the area. There are ships in the docks which run their generators and industrial operations which use stationary diesel engines, as well as large open piles of fine aggregate lying about. And of course there is plenty of traffic, including HGVs travelling between the A or the Edinburgh Bypass and Leith.A simple graph of average pollution during the week helps show the main culprits. Pollution grows from a low overnight level from about am, plateauing during the day and then tailing off again in late afternoon. Pollution is very much lower at the weekend than during the week. Although there is a clear signature of traffic pollution, there is also signicant pollution coming from Leith Docks, mostly from activities during weekday working hours. There is to be a new air quality strategy launched this year. It will need to be much tougher than what we have had so far.Dr Richard Dixon is director of Friends of the Earth Scotland©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why a small rural us state is vital in presidential race henry mcleish","story":"As the first state to hold a caucus or primary to choose the Democrat who will take on Donald Trump, Iowa has an inflated status that one critic claimed was a #crime against democracy#, writes Henry McLeish.For a country that traditionally holds its politics, democracy and governance in such low regard, America appears to enjoy its elections and endless campaigning. This presidential race will have run for nearly two years before culminating in the election on  November, . Before then, America will hold five months of primaries or caucuses in every state of the Union, Washington DC and US territories to select presidential candidates for the November contest. The Republican nomination is a foregone conclusion. The Democratic nomination is not.Iowa, the ‘Hawkeye state’, which few people in the UK have heard of and even fewer have ever visited, lies between Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois and Wisconsin. The state’s caucus attracts a huge amount of media coverage, creates a vast amount of polling data and political debate and,precedent is anything to go by, provides a reasonable insight into who will eventually win the presidential race.: Donald Trump’s resort hosts just  weddings in seven years: Why Donald Trump should read Robert Burns’ poem To a Louse – Henry McLeishAt this time of year when the US election machine is rapidly cranking up, why does Iowa figure so prominently in the minds of pundits, pollsters and politicians  Iowa was the first state to hold a caucus in . Despite the efforts of the two main parties to persuade  states to give up caucuses and move to primaries, which are better organised, more democratic and less archaic, Iowa continues to defy this advice. MomentumThe Iowa caucus takes place on  February and will be the first time in this marathon election campaign that voters have a say: this probably explains the importance of Iowa, it is the first real votes being cast, it is the first state in the Union to offer a view on the condition of America – so it is not an opinion poll.The controversy over so much importance being given to Iowa as the first state to have a real poll has not diminished the interest or enthusiasm on the part of Democratic candidates, desperate to secure that first endorsement or a decent showing, and secure a positive impact on the rest of their campaign.But the stakes are high. The outcome may confirm or rebut early polling results. For Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, who are leading the polls for the Democratic nomination, victory in Iowa would create momentum, a sense of legitimacy and electability, and provide a considerable psychological boost eventhere is no doubt that Iowa is not a microcosm of America.For those doing less well, Iowa could force them to rethink their campaign or quit the race.There is a body of opinion that the importance of Iowa as the first test of public opinion can be overblown and that the primary in New Hampshire on  February will provide a better picture.The more serious criticisms of Iowa are aimed at the very idea of a caucus-driven assessment of voting intentions and the cultural and political identity of the state.Iowa is a small rural state with a population of . million. The caucus comprises , precincts who meet in churches, libraries, community halls, schools and houses. Citizens vote by show of hands or breaking into groups after representatives make the case for each of the candidates. There is no secret ballot. If a candidate doesn’t get  per cent support, they are eliminated.Church-going valuesThe purpose of the exercise is to vote for candidates but also to appoint  pledged delegates who will vote at the state convention. Eight super delegates, who are not pledged to a particular candidate, will be added to the delegation. The idea of super delegates created such bitterness in the Sanders-Clinton battle in . The state’s delegates will then attend the Democratic Convention in Milwaukee in July, when the presidential candidate will be confirmed.This seems like an exhaustive grassroots process, but it is an archaic and often chaotic procedure where the caucus can take hours and can be “rowdy” and “raucous”, sounding more like an energised public meeting than a well-organised polling station. While the caucus process has obvious weaknesses, it is the nature of Iowa itself that make this an unlikely bellwether state.Dismissed by critics as a “flyover state”, Iowa is known for some of the world’s most fertile soil and is first in the country for “the production of corn, oats, soya beans and cattle”. Criticisms of how representative it is, revolve around its  per cent white population, its church-going values, limited urban population, and having an older population: more white, more Christian and more conservative. One critic said: “Iowa [the caucus] is a crime against democracy and ought to be done away with.”A humorous piece in the Washington Post asked whether cows are better represented in the Senate than people, a reference to states like Iowa which has four million sheep, but only . million people.Jimmy Carter’s victoryIn defence of Iowa, results in the state have been within a one per cent deviation from the national electorate since  and it has been a reasonably accurate bellwether for the past two decades. Iowa, in terms of state turnout, ranks among the top five with  per cent as against the US figure of  per cent.

Hillary Clinton received . per cent. Trump carried Iowa by the largest margin of any Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan in .The jury is out on whether Iowa is representative of the US and as such there is pressure not to overstate its signicance for the y debate that lies ahead involving another ten months of expensive and enthusiastic campaigning. What is clear is that a good performance by a candidate in Iowa creates momentum and, in a campaign that will cost billions of dollars, a sound way of keeping campaign finance heading your way.Jimmy Carter certainly appreciated the Iowa experience. He stood for the presidency in . Folklore suggests he hung around Iowa for nearly a year, working the state to death in support of his candidature in the belief that a victory would help him in his struggle to get to the White House. For what had been, up to then, a disappointing campaign, barely registering any support in opinion polls, he won the Iowa caucus and then became President in November. Obama also won Iowa.So Iowa does seem to matter.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll three quarters of public back 25m hobbit house year round events arena in princes street gardens in edinburgh","story":"The survey for the Ross Development Trust found more than two thirds of people were in favour of a wide-ranging transformation of the gardens, which have been largely unchanged since their creation in the th century.The ldquoQuaich Project, which the trust is pursuing with the city council, would see a Hobbit House-style replacement for the existing Ross Bandstand, a two-storey visitor centre and hospitality complex overlooking Edinburgh Castle and a permanent cafe near the Ross Fountain.The Ross Development Trust, set up by Apex Hotels founder Norman Springford to pursue the development, said per cent of respondents backed the overall vision for the historic park, with  per backing the new-look pavilion and amphitheatre which would host the majority of events.However  per cent were opposed or concerned over the scale of changes proposed in the gardens, with nearly a quarter against their use for year-round events.

are being provided, the model that’s being used to deal with mental health is not sufficient enough.“We need a people approach, at the minute people are outcasted and the solution is to go on medication, this is not a proper approach.“There are huge issues in healthcare, today Cork University Hospital is the highest in the country for overcrowding, people waiting on trolleys, we need another hospital for Cork.”Mr Hogan, who is a community development worker says he hopes his candidacy will go some way toward breaking the negative stereotype sometimes attached to his community.“I haven’t had any negative comments really, I’ve been challenged with some of the stereotypical stuff,” he said.All I can say is, Im independent, Ill go against the grain and I wont make promises I cant keepTJ Hogan“When I’m going around the doors, in some cases I’m probably the first Traveller these people have met, I welcome that, the more people start to look past stereotypes, and Travellers getting involved in politics will only break down the barriers.“We have more Travellers in third level education, in good jobs, some are very well known in that regard, I’m running in the General Election, this is all breaking the cycle, positives are being missed, and there is great stuff going on.”Mr Hogan says he will be focusing on people power for his campaign, and has deliberately decided to go poster-free for the environment.“I had the posters used for local election, and still have them but I made a clear choice, the simple fact is, there’s no point adding to environmental waste and I understand why residents get annoyed with them, as they can create hassle.“I have been round the doors, and my campaign is mainly focusing on social media, and meeting people in public places, the support I’ve gotten is overwhelming, people on doorsteps want change, they haven’t got that, and TDs are too focused on what happens in Dublin.“All I can say is, I’m independent, I’ll go against the grain and I won’t make promises I can’t keep.”Sinn Fein’s Padraig Mac Lochlainn was the first TD from a Traveller background in Dail Eireann, whose mother Mary was from the travelling

Their policies are much the same and this can be seen over their past four years in government together.“I am calling on Virgin Media to make public the criteria applied in reaching this decision.Sinn Féin is now taking legal advice on the decision by RTÉ to exclude us from the final leaders debateExcluding other views does a disservice to the public interest and prevents the public from hearing real issues being debated.#GE @MaryLouMcDonald pic oRSxQKYID— Sinn FéinJanuary , “They should reverse this decision immediately and have a debate that’s actually representative of Irish society.”Party leader Mary Lou McDonald has taken legal advice on the issue of the RTE debate, bolstered by a Sunday Times poll which ranks her party within the margin of error of being the second largest in the country.The poll of  voters showed Fianna Fail on % of the vote, with Fine Gael decreasing by seven points to %, just one point ahead of Sinn Fein on %.The margin of error of .%.The Sinn Fein party themselves found out about Wednesday’s debate on social media. One senior party source said the debate was “ridiculous” and the party had directly asked Virgin Mediathey had any other debates planned, to which they allegedly said “nothing at the minute”.Ms McDonald said: “Our position is the same, obviously RTE is the national broadcaster so there is a slight dference, but the democratic principle remains the same.“Huge numbers of people will never vote for Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, they just won’t, they vote for other parties, and I think in the interest of a debate that is genuinely is a debate you have to include those voices.“There is no dference between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, Micheal Martin and Leo Varadkar dfer on very, very little, and have been in government together in their confidence-and-supply arrangement for the past four years, so you’re asking the two arms of that government to debate with each other on the decisions they took together and the consequences people are living with.”Virgin Media has been approached for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say january","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There will be a lot more activity from the unusually quiet four piece I’m assured. Very little other craic at the minute. .Squakdon’t have anything organised yet man..Rebecca Mulhernhas nothing on except uni stuff. googletag.cmd.push .Paddy Nashis hinting a vinyl compilation of all his material later in the year. He also describes a few releases and some solo tours as nothing much. Luckily for them Paddy doesn’t compare himself to other artists. .Basorkhave an announcement to make soon. .Fast Thursdayare flat out recording an album at the minuteandhave very few gigs planned so far. .Ryan Vailhas new music lined up and loads of live shows. .George Huttontells me “Two next gigs coming up are the Ulster Hall in Belfast, th Feb. I’ll be releasing my new album in Feb also and on the th Feb I’ve a gig in St Columb’s Cathedral with Ruth McGinley and the Priests. I’ve been asked to be a judge on BBC School Choir of the year, and they want me to perform live on the BBC in the Guildhall before the final, but I haven’t been given a green light to put that out there yet! Hopefully will today or tomorrow! Man, the new album is a big step up, it’s very much down that Irish channel but it also really showcases what I do best”. googletag.cmd.push .Nazirtold me “Working on my next release which I’m hoping to have out in the next month or so, I’d love to playCeltronic again but I guess I won’t know about that for a while, some technical things with involve are holding us back but as soon as we get that sorted I’ll let u know!” .Caitlin Nashsaid, “I have no clue at the minute because I’m heading back to uni soon but I’m hoping to get a few projects done over there and here when I’m back in the summer”. . At some point we’ll work out why  People don’t get paid for playing gigs. . In April Reevahwill be releasing “A Dferent Light” and she’ll also be heading out on a UK Irish tour as well as putting the finishing touches on her debut album which will be out either by the end of this year or the start of next year. .Declan McLaughlinis feeling nostalgic and will be celebrating his entire career this year, from The Screaming Bin Lids to The Whole Tribe Sings to Central Drive to The Hi Flats, share the love on his Facebook page. . If you’re not really a fan of music then mrk my words, there’s plenty of bland music going live this year. .Roewill be releasing a couple of singles this year with an e.p. on its way after the summer.  Noella Hutton has a new album coming out soon.  .Noella Huttonhas a new album coming very soon called “Love  Liars” and you can check out the video for her video for “I’m Going Crazy” from that album on her Facebook page. .Bloodhaven’t gone away you know. . There will most likely be the same old same old from all the usual quarters but hopefully there’ll also be some of the usual standard of innovative stuff from the likes of Celtronic andOscillations  Modulations.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is presented in association with the House of the Oireachtas Commission and the Department of Foreign Affairs.It features a photo exhibition, information stands and a “photo booth” that allows members of the public to take their own photograph in front of a Daacuteil Chamber background. Today’s event will be officially launched by the Ulster University provost Malachy O’Neill.The event will also feature two short talks by historians Dr Eamon Phoenix and Dr Adrian Grant, setting out the local context of the  election and its repercussions for the region.  January  last year marked  years since the first public meeting of Daacuteil Eacuteireann, following island- wide elections in .Closing a year-long tour, the exhibition explores  years of a shared democratic history, the role parliamentary democracy plays and the way in which democracy is shaping the world today.The arrival of the regional exhibition is part of celebrations to mark  years of Irish Parliamentary democracy and educate the general public about the role and importance of the Irish Parliament.By bringing the exhibition to Derry, the Houses of the Oireachtas is following on from fully-subscribed open days enjoyed by, young and old, in Leinster House in January of last year.The exhibition outlines the many ways in which the work of Daacuteil Eacuteireann has changed and developed since those early days.Daacuteil Eacuteireann held its first public meeting in the Round Room of Dublin’s Mansion House on the  January . All elected members were invited to attend that first meeting but given the complicated political landscape of the time not all could or would attend.On the day,  members were present in the Mansion House. They declared Irish independence, sought inter- national recognition for Ireland’s freedom, and set about the process of building a State. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Whilst defender Colm Horgan is likely to become the fth new signing at the club, there are still a number of spots to be filled, particularly in attack. The City boss will have two attacking trialists in training this week, both of whom could well feature against Finn Harps this Wednesday night at the Brandywell. With two other trialists expected in before the end of the week, Devine is not limiting his options, as he searches for the right players. googletag.cmd.push “We know exactly what we want and we know exactly what we need,” he said. “They have to be the right fit, and they have to be the right personality and the right character because when you see our team at Drogheda and how hard we worked, we cant have anyone come in and think that they can just stroll through games.” Reflecting on the - victory in Drogheda on Friday night, the City boss admitted that the game provided a decent test for his players in the build up to the new season. “It was a character-building exercise as well as anything,” he said. “It wasnt like a normal game when youre refreshed heading into a game because we worked hard beforehand and got a lot of work into the legs of the players. googletag.cmd.push “It was a good test. Drogheda will be a good team this year, because they have a lot of good players in their team. In terms of our first pre-season game I thought it was a very good performance up to an hour. “Obviously when you make nine or ten changes then youre going to lose a wee bit of your edge and ball mastery and how you dominate the ball but there were a lot of very good performances.”  AT HOME AT THE BRANDYWELL... Derry City manager Declan Devine pictured at the Brandywell on Saturday during the Irish League game between Institute and Glentoran. Pic by Tom Heaney City fans who braved the weather for the trip saw a number of new faces on the night and Devine was delighted with the new signings in particular. “We had two or three trialists who did well, but more importantly the new signings that have come to the club did well,” he continued. “I think Walter Figueira was outstanding and he worked very hard. He didnt get his chance but he worked so hard for the team. “I thought Stevie Mallon had a fantastic debut, I thought Conor Clford was excellent and Conor McCormack looks ashes never been away from this club. The we had the guys who were here last year Jamie McDonagh was sensational in the game, Ally Gilchrist playing at left back was very, very good. Ciaron Harkin just keeps getting better so what were going to have this year is a lot of competition for places and rightly so because we have good players at the club and we just have to push it on a wee notch.” Malone One huge positive for Derry City from the weekend was theof midfielder Jack Malone. Malone played for  minutes on hisfrom a long-term knee injury which kept him out of action for three months. He s into an experienced and talented midfield and Devine believes that can only be a good thing for the -year old. “Jack has been brilliant in training,” Devine stated. “He is still finding his feet because he was out for three months but hes like a tiger in midfield because he gets after everything. The one thing that people like Jack Malone can do is look around the group and see serious footballers in the squad. When you have a guy like Conor McCormack sitting at the base of midfield and a guy like Conor Clford playing, these are brilliant role models to have.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Bangor attacker played in Kurtis Bell, who slotted the ball into the inside side-netting after Saintfield were dispossessed at the edge of their own box.Saintfield raised it a few gears and struck three times in the  minutes before half-time.The first came from Andrew Clarke after James Sofley was played down the line. After beating two defenders, James played in Andrew, who passed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner past the lsquokeeper.It took less than five minutes for left back Oliver Duff to score Saintfieldrsquos third. A long ball found Adam Childs on the left wing.He played it back to the edge of the box for Duff. He took one touch to set himself before striking a powerful left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.The Saints scored one more goal before the break with Andrew Clarke playing the ball across the face of goal for Tony Liken to finish at the back post. Saintfield went into half-time in the driving seat and - up.The second half started much like the first ended with Saintfield scoring an early goal.Ryan Sofley was the supplier of an own goal after bombing into the box and fizzing a cross into the near post which ricocheted off the Bangor defender into the net.At - up, the Saints took their foot off the gas and conceded just over five minutes after scoring.Bangor gained possession from a loose ball in midfield and played it into Matty Hall, who turned well to beat the Saintfield defender before striking the ball low and hard into the bottom corner.The Saints were again quick to respond with Andrew Clarke getting his hat-trick with half an hour still to go.Clarke started the move in midfield and finished it expertly after James Sofleyrsquos effort was parried by the lsquokeeper.Saintfield had a penalty and rebound saved less than two minutes later after James Sofley was brought down in the box.However, the Saints werenrsquot finished yet and Clarke had one more goal left in them with  minutes left to go. Possibly the best goal of the game, as he showed real determination and skill to score his fourth. Another counter-attacking goal from the Saints as they broke fast from a Bangor corner.Clarke received the ball just inside the Bangor half and stood tall after several attempts to bring him down. He beat three defenders before slotting home a cool finish into the bottom corner.This goal also signalled the end of the goalkeeperrsquos game after he strongly disagreed with the refereersquos decision to allow the goal to stand. Bangor had one more chance before the end of the game when they were also awarded a penalty, but David Harper kept the Saintsrsquo five-goal lead intact and made it a penalty saved for both teams.A great performance for Saintfield who progress to the next round of the cup and a fantastic performance from  year-old Andrew Clarke who relished his role as an attacking midfielder.Saintfield United Bangor Young Men CLARENCE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"THE re-establishment of the Stormont Executive has led to fresh calls for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.Newly appointed Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is being urged to signal the start of construction work on the scheme which is estimated to cost in excess of poundm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former roads minister in a previous Executive who signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  mdash has written to Ms Mallon seeking an assurance that the Ballynahinch scheme remains a priority for her department and that construction work will start as soon as possible.In addition, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is tabling a notice of motion at the February meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council seeking across-the-board political support to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon discuss the next step in the construction of the bypass.He also confirmed that Strangford MP, Jim Shannon, has written to Ms Mallon on the issue and is seeking a meeting with her to discuss the issue.There has been major progress on work on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.They are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the by-pass would provide a good economic .The scheme is designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard said that following his decision to formally sign off the scheme at the end of , the government department had been working through ious legal stages to ensure the scheme could commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed last year, he confirmed.ldquoThis allowed the Department to move ahead with the final stage of preparing contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWith an Infrastructure Minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont this week, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.Cllr Walker said it was the view of many, including senior roads engineers, that the multi-million pound scheme was vital to the survival of Ballynahinch town centre and will play a signicant role in helping boost the wider South Down economy.He said given that the project is shovel ready, it is essential that the cash is earmarked to allow construction work to start this year is forthcoming.ldquoMoving forward what is now required is the finance to build this scheme, continued Cllr Walker.ldquoIt is clear to me that when you look at other parts of Northern Ireland that Down District has consistently missed out on major roads funding.

The cabinet was later found along the side of the Carrickmannon Road, near Ballygowan.The drugs taken included heroin and cocaine, both of which are dangerous even in small doses. They are types of hard drug in big demand on the black market. Additives like glucose are used by drug pushers to multiply the volume and increase profits. Other drugs, including morphine and strychnine, were also taken.The raid was the latest in a spate across the province and police fear that the addiction problem could be more serious than previously realised.Police chiefs have backed chemists pressing for an urgent review of the Home Office regulations about the keeping of prescribed drugs in steel cabinets.The present procedure is making things too easy for the thieves. It has meant that the hard drugs are all kept in the same place and the professional thief knows that.Before  regulations, chemists had better safeguards, evenit meant hiding the hard drugs on the general drugs shelves.

The Ballynahinch venture was unique in having a large amount of surviving documentation.Mr Reid says it is clear from these papers that the scheme organised by the First Presbyterian Church was sophisticated, comprehensive, self-funded, and cradle-to-grave in scope. It included widowsrsquo and old age pensions, end of le and burial grants, and support for orphans.Finance allocated to the project was known as lsquoThe Poorrsquos Moneyrsquo. The scheme operated late in the reign of William III and was continued into the time of Queen Anne, George I and George II.Nowadays benefit claimants unable to work through illness or injury, are paid Employment Support Allowance, .In  a similar scheme was obviously operating in Ballynahinch. The church carpenter at that time was John Gough, and that year he suffered a signicant injury, perhaps a broken arm or leg. He was unable to work or to earn a living for over a year.John had been married six years earlier in , in his home congregation by Rev James McAlpine. His we was Elizabeth, neacutee Ferguson. Their children soon followed mdash Christine, who was five in  Rebecca, who was four, and their twin boys, George and James, who were just one year and one month.With four young children and no income, John and Elizabeth were soon struggling financially. But in April the church stepped in immediately, with payments for an initial three-month period, at six shillings per instalment. In August John tried to resume work, but couldnrsquot. The church continued payments, but now at a reduced rate of d. Another attempt at work in October  failed again, and again payments resumed.John eventually recovered and ed to work permanently in August , having received a total of  support payments from First Presbyterian. He resumed his valuable role in maintenance of the fabric, receiving church contracts in ,  and .The problem of unwed mothers and absent fathers is one that troubles every age and every generation. Back in the early s, the Ballynahinch Session took a stern approach to fire-and-forget fatherhood.Their starting point was an interview with the expectant mother to ascertain the identity of her co-responsible male partner. If she proved uncompliant, exclusion from church attendance was then threatened. Faced with resultant near-total social ostracism, the mother-to-be soon cooperated.The next stage involved the errant couple appearing some Sunday morning before the entire congregation, kneeling on the Stool of Repentance and confessing their extramarital transgression. After that they were received back into the congregation. Their child was baptised and recognised as a church member.In a -year period the Ballynahinch Session dealt with  such cases. In six, they identied both parents. In six other cases only the mother was identied in seven, only the father. In one case the origins and surname of a lsquofoundlingrsquo child were known, but neither parent actually came forward.By st century standards, these church procedures sound draconian. But they had the purpose of protecting the rights of the child and of offering an opportunity to the parents for their reputations to be salvaged,possible.The alternatives were a lot worse. It was common in the s for the sexton at Magheradroll Parish Church to discover live newborns abandoned overnight on his church doorstep, ordead through neglect or infanticide, to find their bodies surreptitiously concealed in adjacent graves.In Ireland such surviving infants were sent in large numbers to the Foundling Hospital in Dublin, which who received between ,-, orphans annually. The hospitalrsquos mortality rate was some %.In Ballynahinch, under Presbyterian auspices, some such infants were spared this grisly fate. The lives of a number of potential orphans were actively protected by the church in their home town.Under the Welfare Reform Act of , Disabled Living Allowance was controversially replaced with Personal Independence Payment. DLA payments were made to claimants who often had long term medical conditions. The amount of the award ied according to the degree of disability.Interestingly, in Ballynahinch in the early s, First Presbyterian made a number of long-term DLA-type awards to some lsquosupplicantsrsquo.Ms Grissel Foreman was on such a benefit from -. Some financial records of the Poorrsquos Money still exist. But all its other documentation is lost, so we donrsquot know what Grisselrsquos ailment actually was. It was obviously slow and progressive, perhaps something like tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis, or Parkinsonrsquos.As her condition deteriorated, the church increased its amount of financial support. In  she received seven payments totalling s d. By  this had escalated to  payments totalling pound s d.She died in  and was buried at church expense. Over  years, amounts paid to her totalled pound s d. This was an enormous sum, considering the church ministerrsquos annual stipend at the time was pound.These and many other such stories will be outlined on Monday night at Down Museum.

Rail chiefs, who had been hoping for investment after the railways had proved so crucial to the war effort a few years earlier and that the buses would be barred from competing with the trains and instead provide a feeder service to stations, were devastated at the outcome.ldquoThe recommendation, accepted by Stormont, was that the entire Belfast and County Down Railway main line from Belfast to Newcastle, including the branches to Donaghadee, Ballynahinch and Ardglass, should be closed.The only route to be saved was the Belfast to Bangor connection, which continues operating successfully to this day.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe attitude of Stormont was that it would be cheaper to move everything to the roads than to invest in railways that had been run down during the Second World War. People would use the buses instead. They developed huge road building schemes mdash most were never completed mdash but closed the railways first before these were even started. It seems incredible today.ldquoThe most puzzling element of the decision was the axing of the Belfast to Newtownards line, which served the east of the city mdash Dundonald, Knock and Comber areas in which the suburbs were developing and likely to provide increased commuter traffic had they been spared.ldquoIndeed, there were more than enough new diesel trains ordered to operate both the Bangor and Newtownards lines mdash and evidence suggests that the Transport Tribunal expected Stormont to spare the Comber line as a compromise option and as late as , before the tracks were lted, they were calling on the minister responsible to reverse the decision and trial these new diesel trains on this section of track mdash a call that fell on deaf ears.The  closures were the first steps in a plan which was to see the reduction of the Northern Irelandrsquos railway network from  miles to  miles mdash a decrease of  per cent.A decade later, the Great Northern Railway was ided between the UTA and its counterpart in the Republic, CIE, and further closures to lines to Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane occurred.Willie Watterson and James Magill, who were porters and ticket clerks at Newcastle and Tullymurry stations, recalled their memories of the last train in an interview recorded for the BBC documentary lsquoRaising Steamrsquo in ldquoThe last train was a Sunday night. It was a cold winter night, January , , said Willie. There was twelve coaches, and two engines and two guards. She was packed. Packed to the doors. So I lit all the lamps, and put detonators on the line to give her a send-off.James added: ldquoI think every station did the same thing, so when the train came in there was a salute of bangs. I felt terrible about it, terribly terribly sad. I still felt it couldnrsquot happen. Still felt theyrsquoll come back, theyrsquoll run again. I couldnrsquot believe therersquod be no more railways, after working on them so hard.Adam Hamilton, who was a fireman mdash the person who stoked the fire on the steam locomotives mdash said: ldquoIt broke my heart, because the railways were in my blood.

Maybe its just a bit of magic dust, but itrsquos definitely a unique ability to get players to play for him.ldquoIt doesnrsquot matter what age you are. If you are good enough, he will give you a chance, he added.ldquoDonrsquot forget we won the Ulster League last season with five or six minors starting regularly every week.ldquoThat injection of youth sure helped the lads get a great start to the season and everything fell into place after that, he continued.Gilligan also believes that Moranrsquos love for the game and the way it should be played has rubbed off on the players.ldquoMickey is extremely keen on discipline. He insists the players play the game and let the referee do his thing without being shouted at.ldquoHe doesnrsquot rant or rave from the sidelines and expects that same response from the players and gets it, he added.Dedication and team structure are what he has instilled at Eoghan Rua Parc and a love for the game along with a winning environment.Kilcoo have been the benchmark in Down football for the past decade, but Moran has taken them a stage further in just  months.Corofin may be blessed with several players who have turned out regularly for Galway and in Kieran Fitzgerald, Liam Silke, Kieran McGrath, Gary Sice and Ian and Daithi Burke they have the nucleus of a talented outfit.However, Kilcoo believe they bigger they are, the harder they fall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Minister.jpg","title":"Minister vows to end strikes with pay deal  ","story":"HEALTH staff across the district were yesterday digesting the news that new Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann had confirmed that pay parity with their colleagues in England can now be restored.He told the Assembly that it would cost an extra poundm that would come from within existing Stormont finances.Mr Swann met with representatives from a number of leading health trade unions to brief them on the decision, describing the talks as ldquoconstructive.The new man in charge of the Provincersquos health portfolio said the ldquobreakthrough that we all wanted has been achieved this isa good day after some very dficult days.Mr Swann announced that the Department of Health had already gathered together poundm to increase pay for health workers, with an extra poundm being pulled from existing finances at Stormont.His decision to address the pay issue came after a series of strikes involving staff across the health and social services sector over pay and staffing levels.Nurses and other health workers in Northern Ireland have been taking industrial action over pay and staffing levels, with Mr Swann confirming that his officials would work with the unions on the issue of safe staffing levels in the health service and hopes a plan can be drawn up to establish such levels ldquowithin a reasonable period of time.Today, representatives from trade unions representing nurses and all health and social services staff will meet with Department of Health officials, with Mr Swann hoping for a ldquoswt end to their industrial action.He added: ldquoOur nurses and great social care workers can come off the picket-line.Prior to yesterdayrsquos announcement, local nurses said that they hoped that theof Stormont would pave the way for the pay parity and staffing issues to be finally addressed.Ahead of yesterdayrsquos meeting, the RCN said while welcoming the restoration of the Stormont administration, nurses had been made many promises.The RCNrsquos Northern Ireland Director, Pat Cullen, said nurses wanted to see those promises converted into action.Last Wednesday and Friday, nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals took part in the latest round of stoppages and were buoyed by the support of passing motorists and others as they manned the picket-line at the entrance to the Downshire Civic Centre.Braving bitterly cold conditions last Friday morning, nurses were hoping for positive news from Stormont, hours after Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney had published the New Decade New Approach document.Nurses, who had sacriced another dayrsquos pay, were joined at one stage on the picket-line by South Eastern Trust interim chief executive Seamus McGoran and Roisin Coulter, the organisationrsquos director of planning.Nurses said that they hoped that the political parties would go back into government and that their demands for pay parity and safe staffing levels would be met.ldquoWe believe that the collective pressure of health service staff has ensured that politicians know that they must get back to Stormont, said nurse Irene Murray.ldquoWe do not want to be used as political pawns and hope that there is cross-party agreement for politicians to get back to work. While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out. They canrsquot cope with the demands being made on them, she added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Now.jpg","title":"Now is the time for delivery – McGrath  ","story":"THE restoration of the Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive should herald delivery for people at the start of a new decade, according to South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath.Mr McGrath was able to take his seat in the Assembly chamber for the first time in three years last Saturday, an occasion which he described as a ldquomomentous day for Northern Ireland and its future.He said that with so many issues staring people in the face including Brexit, y hospital waiting times, workersrsquo rights and wages, welfare issues and an education system in crisis, Northern Ireland needed a restored and fully ing Assembly and Executive to deal with these mammoth issues.The Assemblyman described his partyrsquos decision to re-enter the Executive as an act of ldquotrust and goodwill.He continued: ldquoWe all know the reasons why the last Executive failed and these have been well covered.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.The figures are available on the NI Direct website under the reporting fault problems menu with other districthot-spots including Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order.Elsewhere,  faults have been reported in Killyleagh, with  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention. We are still in the grip of winter and several months away from the clearer evenings. Now that we have a local minister in place, I hope to meet her on this issue and other matters of local importance.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continued to face budget challenges and resources were currently not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service.She added: ldquoDue to this restricted service, outages are taking longer than usual to be repaired.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

The firm is marking two decades leading the way in the industry, and according to founder Terry Moore, the firm is well on its way to doubling its size and embracing the latest technology for its clients Outsource Solutions is a firm which is ahead of the curve when it comes to emerging technologies and a company which embeds itself in a client’s business to ensure total integration – ultimately helping to boost it and help it grow.“Our approach is to embed ourselves into the customer’s business, and take IT out of the boardroom,” Terry says. “What we do is try to get ahead of some of the problems, understand the business and recognise that the technology is there to benefit the company.“We are there to make sure that business is possible – enriching lives, making things easier and safer. An important part of this is the relationships that we have.”Terry formed Outsource Solutions  years ago, around the time of the so-called ‘millennium bug’ when he says some firms were using scare tactics to get businesses to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds, often unnecessarily. “For me, one of the things I felt was missing was understanding a business and factoring that refresh into it over a few years – letting them get on with what they do.”The company – which now has five locations, including Belfast – is a full service IT firm which manages every element of a business’s infrastructure, including security, enterprise wi-fi, telecoms and networking.“We now have just over  staff and are we are on a five-year plan to double in size again. There has been considerable growth in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and telecoms,” Terry says.Client retention is also something which Terry and the business prides itself on. “Every customer that we signed up with in , we still work with,” he says. “We will give a recommendation as to how we think a network should be built. If they accept that, then we take it on as a risk.“Technology is just a toolbox for us to allow us to deliver IT – technology to allow them to really access and control their data.”Outsource is a business which has been at the forefront of emerging developments in technology, including cyber-security. Terry says, even just a few years ago, it wasn’t being taken seriously by many businesses. That has now changed signicantly.“In the last couple of years, cyber has completely exploded – but we were ahead of our time,” he says. “My experience of last  years and the last five in particular is that there has been a massive job to do in educating businesses and their users about the cyber threat.“We have reached the tipping point and the human firewall is becoming much stronger – people and users are more sensitive to what it means, making it all a far better place. But there are still businesses which are happy to cut fast and loose, and take risks.”While the company’s client base started off in professional services businesses – such as law and accounting – it’s grown into a host of sectors, including transport, logistics, manufacturing and engineering.“We have carved out a niche in hospitality as well – particularly in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and communication, generally.”Terry says Outsource is seeing business growth among many of Northern Ireland’s medium-sized businesses, with more than  staff.“Our job is to enhance, improve and optimise the performance for as many users as we can. Our aim over the next four years is to be able to deliver those services outside Northern Ireland, across the rest of the UK and into the Republic of Ireland.“For us, the constant is that we are always there at that point of where technology is consumed. The role we play is being integrated and a trusted advisor. That’s how we will continue to be successful.”As for the next  years, with a rise in automation and articial intelligence – something Terry says has to become a little more intelligent and a little less articial – the next major leap will be the advent of quantum computing. It’s something which remains in its infancy.“While it’s still early, we are on the verge of the most aggressive technological change that any of us have ever seen,” he says.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
