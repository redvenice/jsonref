When millions of people in each age cohort are desperate to book jab appointments as soon as they become available online, it’s profoundly discriminatory to build a system that requires only pregnant women to jump through multiple hoops.\u0027An NHS spokeswoman said: \u0027Following the updated guidance set out by the JCVI, the NHS immediately communicated the advice to GPs.\u0027If you’re pregnant, or think you might be, speak to your maternity team or GP surgery to discuss your vaccine appointment so that it can be arranged at a site offering the PfizerBioNTech or the Moderna vaccine, which is preferable for pregnant women.\u0027It comes after the JCVI today recommended that all those under-40 should receive an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine, amid plummeting infections.Advisers made the recommendation after more adults suffered the potentially-fatal clotting disorder in the past week.They said the absolute risk of the clots is still \u0027extremely small\u0027, affecting around one in 100,000 people given the British-made jab.So far regulators have spotted major blood clots in 242 people, of whom 49 died. But they are occurring more in younger adults, with a rate of around one in 60,000 under-40s.Experts said the infection rate in the UK is now so low that the risk of the rare clots outweigh that of Covid in younger adults, who often only suffer mild illness. They will be offered the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines instead, so long as there is enough supply and it won\u0027t delay the rollout.Anyone, no matter what age, who has been given their first dose of the AstraZeneca jab and didn\u0027t suffer the complication is being urged to come forward for their second.England\u0027s deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam claimed the change would not affect the Government\u0027s target to vaccinate all adults by July 31.\u0027Our vaccine supply schedule will support the change without limiting the speed and scale of the vaccine roll-out,\u0027 he told a televised Downing Street press conference.\u0027I do expect that we are still on target to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July.\u0027It was previously recommended on April 7 that those under 30 with no underlying health conditions should be offered an alternative to AstraZeneca. "},{"url":null,"title":"Liz Cheney secretly orchestrated Washington Post op ed ten living former Defense Secretaries","story":"Share this articleForced to Choose Between Trump’s “Big Lie” and Liz Cheney, the House G.O.P.

Ouch.Of course, Leicester have been poor. Their defence has clearly struggled badly in the absence of Evans and although they have generated numerous chances with four shots on target, their finishing has been consistently meek. We’ll see what they have in the second half. This is not over.“Considering their remaining fixtures Leicester better wake up. Right now they are getting played off the pitch.” Wilson has also made some really smart off-the-ball runs and looks like one of the best players on the pitch so far.Needless to say, this is a must-win game.It was around this point last season that Leicester’s top four chase truly began to crumble when they absorbed a humiliating 4-1 loss to Bournemouth, the start of three losses in their final four games and the end of their hopes of returning to Europe that season.  Things are not as they were. In third place, Leicester are currently four points better off than at this point last season and although their 1-1 draw with Southampton last Friday was the source of some frustration, their last four games in all competitions yielded three wins and that one draw. Another victory would mark an essential buffer between themselves and West Ham in fifth, also giving them a chance being comfortable enough to start planning for the FA Cup final in their final days of the season. Newcastle, meanwhile, are coming off a decisive month of April in which they admirably put themselves in a strong position for survival with two wins and two draws, prompting Steve Bruce to be nominated for manager of the month not too long after absorbing weeks of criticism and calls for his firing. The away team arrive at King Power Stadium with the opportunity to ensure their presence in the league for another season. Currently in 17th, a victory would catapult them from 17th place to 13th and with 39 points. Fulham, currently on 27 points in 18th, would have to win their four remaining games and hope that Newcastle don’t earn another point just to draw level with them.

But under Holyrood’s proportional representation system, those successes could see it lose seats on the regional list ballot. Labour’s Jackie Baillie held on to her Dumbarton constituency - which had been the most marginal seat in all of Scotland and a top target for the SNP. With some constituencies still to be counted on Saturday, when the crucial regional list results will also be declared, Sturgeon said it was “not impossible”. The Conservative candidate scored 79,863 first preference votes, ahead of his Labour rival, Sadiq Khan, who scored 74,854 votes. The Green Party’s Sian Berry was third, with 13,041 votes. Baillie won 17,825 votes, compared to 16,342 for the SNP’s Tony Giugliano. In 2016, the Dumbarton seat went to the Labour deputy leader by just 109 votes, but increased to 1,483. Asked by the BBC about his Alba Party’s prospects, the former Scotland first minister said “whether we will make it tomorrow, I don’t think so on the results we’ve seen”. “I think probably we will take out of this election the arguments we have been putting forward will be proven to be correct. Firstly that independence should be front and centre of election campaigns if we want to persuade people to vote for it. “And, secondly, it looks like, though it is not certain, that the SNP will be poised on an overall majority but there won’t be the backing in terms of the enthusiasm for getting on with the independence referendum. “Crucially, it seems perhaps a million, perhaps even more than a million, SNP votes on the regional list are going to elect perhaps one, perhaps two MSPs on that section of the ballot paper across Scotland. What a waste.” Bailey polled 53,713 first preference votes compared with 51,508 for Khan. Sian Berry, from the Green Party, was third with 10,239 first preference votes.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

Photograph: Oli ScarffAFP via Getty ImagesNorthern Ireland’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout is set to be delayed by several weeks due to changed UK advice on using AstraZeneca jabs, the head of the programme has said.The clotting issue had already prompted the under-30 age cohort to be offered the Pfizer jab instead of AstraZeneca.Ms Donnelly said the majority of people aged 30-39 will now be offered the Pfizer jab too, with these doses being primarily administered in regional vaccine centres away from the main centre at Belfast’s SSE Arena.People who have already received a first dose of AstraZeneca will receive a second dose of the same jab, while others can make an informed choice to have the AstraZeneca vaccine if they wish.Prior to the JCVI decision, Ms Donnelly told Stormont MLAs that Northern Ireland was set to complete the vaccination of the adult population by the end of August.She said the decision to offer the under-30 age cohort a vaccine other than AstraZeneca had pushed the timeline for delivering all first doses back to potentially the end of July.Ms Donnelly said the latest advice from the JCVI would lead to a further slowing of the rollout.“Protecting our adult population through vaccination is a huge and unprecedented undertaking,” said Ms Donnelly.“Logistical challenges are inevitable, but the programme has already proved itself to be highly resilient.“I would again appeal for patience from the public, as we reset the programme in light of the updated JCVI advice.‘Steady but limited’“Pfizer supplies remain steady but limited, so our progress with the 30-39 age group will be limited for the next few weeks.“Likewise, those under 30 will have to wait a few weeks before being offered appointments for their first dose.”A number of changes to Northern Ireland’s vaccine programme will come into effect from Monday as a consequence of the JCVI advice.- People aged 40-plus can book AstraZeneca first-dose appointments at the SSE Arena vaccination centre and community pharmacies.- People aged 30-39 can book their Pfizer first-dose appointments at the other regional health trust vaccination centres in Northern Ireland.- People aged 30-39 can choose to make an informed decision to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine from participating community pharmacies if they prefer, or if they decide they would rather not wait to receive an alternative jab.- Anyone aged under 40 already booked for their first vaccine at one of the trust centres, including the SSE Arena in Belfast, will have this appointment honoured — with the Pfizer vaccine.- Anyone of any age who has received an AstraZeneca first dose should proceed with their second dose of AstraZeneca — unless they had an extreme adverse reaction to their first dose.Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said: “It is important to reiterate that the potential risk associated with the AZ (AstraZeneca) first dose is extremely rare and that the threat from Covid-19 is much higher for the majority of adults.“Getting vaccinated against this virus gives us hope — it protects us and helps us to start to reclaim normality.“I am looking forward to getting my second dose of AstraZeneca in the near future and I would again encourage everyone to come forward without delay for their first and second jabs when it’s their turn.”One further death of a patient who had previously tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland was announced on Friday along with 65 new cases of the virus.On Friday morning, there were 62 Covid-19 positive inpatients in hospital, of whom six were in intensive care. – PA "},{"url":null,"title":"twitter suspends nine accounts linked to profile used by eoghan harris","story":"Eoghan Harris was dropped by the Sunday Independent.  File photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe Twitter has suspended a total of nine accounts it believes are linked to an anonymous account used by prominent former Sunday Independent columnist Eoghan Harris.The well-known writer and former senator was dropped by the Sunday Independent as a columnist this week after management learned he was contributing to an account behind a fake name.The announcement was made by the newspaper’s editor Alan English on Thursday night. He said the content posted from the account, much of which was directed at Sinn Féin and nationalists, went beyond fair and reasonable comment.“We regard Eoghan Harris’s involvement with this account as a betrayal of trust and as such his contract has been terminated.”The account, which used the handle @barbarapym2, after the English novelist, has since been permanently suspended by Twitter, along with eight other Twitter accounts the company believes to be linked to it.A Twitter spokeswoman confirmed the move on Friday, saying that “platform manipulation is strictly prohibited under the Twitter Rules”.“The account you referenced was permanently suspended for violating the Twitter Rules on platform manipulation and spam,” the company told The .“We also suspended eight accounts linked to the account referenced for violating our policy on platform manipulation and spam.“Using technology and human review in concert, we proactively monitor Twitter to identify attempts at platform manipulation and mitigate them – we will continue this approach to platform manipulation and any other attempts to undermine the integrity of our service.”Harris (79) confirmed he contributed to the Barbara Pym account, which he said was operated by a “team of five or six people”. He declined to name these people, saying he did not want to “get them shot.”However, he denied association any other anonymous accounts. One of the suspended accounts, belongs to a woman aged in her 40s who was a student of his, Harris said.He said this woman is appealing the suspension of her account.“How would I have the energy to run nine accounts?” asked Harris.Since February 2020, the Barbara Pym account has been posting strident and sometimes abusive anti-Sinn Féin content. It was also regularly used to praise the work of Harris and his colleagues at the newspaper while railing against other journalists’ work.One of the account’s targets was Irish Examiner political correspondent Aoife Grace Moore.“This account sent me sexualised messages about whether Mary Lou McDonald ‘turned me on’, the size of my arse and called me a terrorist from the month I started at the Examiner. Since then, I’ve had to go to counselling and the guards,” Moore tweeted on Thursday after the Sunday Independent announced it had dropped Harris.‘Sniping’Last October, the Pym account tweeted “Moore thinks she is sniping safely from behind Derry hedges, but she’s actually sniping from an ROI hedge in the Examiner and her SF backside is sticking up in the air.”In June, Moore tweeted that Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald had just taken her seat as the first female leader of the opposition. “So that’s what turns you on?” the Pym account replied.Harris denied these tweets were offensive on Friday afternoon and said there is a long history of writers using pseudonyms. He said he has asked Twitter to go into the Pym account’s private messages to confirm none of them were offensive.Moore, who is from Derry, said she was not in a position to comment.Another account linked by Twitter to the Pym account previously accused Moore of being a “Provo” writing for a “Provo rag.”In a further detailed statement issued on Friday afternoon, Harris said he is one of a rotating panel of people who “curate” the Pym account, “who oppose Sinn Fein’s campaign to bully Northern Protestants into an Irish Republic.“Given Sinn Fein’s sinister links, the other contributors are loathe to use their names.”He said he had no issue admitting his use of the account to editorial colleagues.“That’s because I am proud of the tweets which are mostly addressed to Loyalists, the most recent of them urging restraint on protests against the Protocol and assuring working class unionists that most of us in the Republic have no malign agenda against their heritage and political freedoms.”Harris strongly denied Moore received ”sexualised” private messages from the Pym account. Moore has not said the messages were private.“Furthermore, I also categorically deny that Aoife Moore was ever called a “terrorist” on Barbara J Pym, as she claims, and I call on her to show a screen grab of any tweet supporting her charge.”He said the two public tweets referenced by Moore were “clearly political and could equally be applied to a man.”He said “the women on the Pym site” did not regard these tweets as offensive or gendered in any way.He said Moore receives “scores” of critical messages and that they are not all from the Pym account.In an interview on RTÉ’s Drivetime programme with Sarah McInerney on Friday evening, Harris said he ran the account with five others, including “trade unionists, historians and businesspeople”.‘Sinister links’He refused to reveal the other users’ names “given Sinn Féin’s sinister links” but told McInerney they consisted of the “older generation” and that there were no other politicians or journalists involved.He said there was a long history of journalists using hidden identities communicate with their readers. “There’s nothing problematic about anonymity in my view.”When it was put to Harris that in 2008, he had criticised anonymous internet users as “little wankers masturbating in a room”, he responded: “That was then. That was before Sinn Féin culled that huge vote in the election.”He said he had admitted being involved in the account to his editors. “That’s because I am proud of the tweets which are mostly addressed to loyalists, the most recent of them urging restraint on protests against the protocol and assuring working class unionists that most of us in the Republic have no malign agenda against their heritage and political freedoms.”Harris insisted that he had no involvement with any other profiles and that he would “have to be superman” to operation so many accounts.The accounts were suspended because Twitter has come under “major pressure. And I suspect the pressure is coming from Sinn Féin,” he claimed.Harris said he was not sorry he became involved in the account. “I would have had to find an outlet to deal with Northern Ireland one way or another. It is my life.”He also denied he was behind tweets from the Pym account which effusively praised his own writing.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cabinet to approve move to allow adopted people rights to records","story":"Access to information and tracing legislation was promised by Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman in the wake of the mother and baby home report earlier this year.

Now the Government, relying on European data protection legislation, says it can adopt a different approach to opening up the records.The general scheme of the Bill – or “heads” – which summarises the intention of each section, is scheduled to go to Cabinet on Tuesday. If approved, the legislation will then be drafted, and it is expected to be presented to the Oireachtas later this year.For years, many adopted people have experienced severe difficulty in accessing their early life records and have often been granted only partial access. However, the new legislation will take an “expansive” approach to iniduals’ rights to access records relating to their early lives, it is understood.While the legislation is said to be complex, its most important aspect is a simple one – establishing a right to access documents that was previously denied. Previous attorneys general had advised governments that granting an automatic right of access to documents to adopted people would be unconstitutional and several attempts to legislate over the past two decades have floundered. The present Attorney General, Paul Gallagher, however, took a different view and it is understood that the right to access has been grounded in the European data law, the GDPR. It is also expected that the Bill will provide for State assistance for adopted people to trace their birth mothers, and a contact tracing register that could facilitate contacts."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 who approves china s sinopharm vaccine for emergency use","story":"A separate group advising the UN agency on vaccines said it was ‘very confident’  the Sinopharm vaccine protects people aged 18-59. Photograph: Robert AtanasovskiAFPGettyThe World Health Organisation has given authorisation for emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by China’s Sinopharm, potentially paving the way for millions of doses to reach countries in need through a UN-backed programme.The decision by a WHO technical advisory group opens the possibility that the Sinopharm vaccine could be included in the UN-backed Covax programme in coming weeks or months, and distributed through Unicef and the WHO’s regional office in the Americas.Sinopharm has released little data publicly, aside from efficacy numbers for its two jabs – one developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products and the other by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products.The Beijing vaccine is one that was considered by the WHO for the emergency use listing.“This afternoon, WHO gave emergency use listing to sign off on Beijing’s Covid-19 vaccine, making it the sixth vaccine to receive WHO validation for safety, efficacy and quality,” director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.“This expands the list of vaccines that Covax can buy and gives countries confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval and to import and administer a vaccine.”A separate group advising the UN agency on vaccines said it was “very confident” the Sinopharm vaccine protects people aged 18-59.But the group said it had a “low level of confidence” in efficacy in people aged 60 and over, and “very low confidence” in the available data about serious side effects in that age group. – APEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"michel barnier details bewilderment with british approach to brexit talks","story":"Michel Barnier  describes former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as “courageous”, while  Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is “always shrewd, methodical and well-informed”. Photograph:  John ThysAFP via Getty ImagesOn Christmas Eve last year, as the Brexit negotiations were entering their final minutes, Michel Barnier sought out his British counterpart in a room in the European Commission’s Berlaymont headquarters.“After nine months of negotiations, it is the last time I would see David Frost and our final exchange is professional and cold,” Barnier, who was chief Brexit negotiator, writes in The Great Illusion: a secret Brexit diary (2016-2020)“He knows I know that until the last moment he has been trying to circumvent me by opening a parallel negotiating track with Ursula von der Leyen’s cabinet. And he knows it has not been successful.”Although he describes Frost as courteous, Barnier makes clear that he neither trusted the British negotiator nor admired his negotiating style. A few weeks earlier, when the British team were refusing to engage with issues of concern to the European side, Barnier told them their negotiating technique was a farce.Throughout his 500-page diary, which is published in French on Thursday and will appear in an English translation in October, Barnier is bewildered by the British approach to the talks. He never wavers from his conviction that Britain made a mistake in leaving the European Union but he is surprised again and again by the incompetence and self-delusion that informed London’s negotiating strategy.When Theresa May declared in Lancaster House that Britain wanted to leave the single market and the customs union but hoped to maintain many of their benefits, he could scarcely believe what he was hearing.“Have the consequences of these decisions been thought through, measured, discussed? Does she realise this rules out almost all forms of cooperation we have with our partners?” he writes.“I am amazed at the way the prime minister has shown her hand.”He is generous towards May, describing her as a courageous woman surrounded by a lot of men putting their personal interests ahead of those of their country. Boris Johnson was one of those men but Barnier is careful not to underestimate him and finds him to be an appealing, if “baroque”, personality.He enjoyed a warm relationship with David Davis but has little complimentary to say about the next Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, whom he describes as having a messianic glint in his eye.When Raab demanded that the Irish Border issue should be resolved as part of an overall agreement, he warned that the EU would otherwise be responsible for the impact of a no-deal Brexit in the North.‘The fault of the UK’“We are searching for solutions together. And Dominic, if this threat is the new line of your government, then the negotiations can end immediately. And I will prepare myself in the coming days to inform the European Parliament and member states. We will regard the failure as being the fault of the UK,” Barnier told him.From the start, the issue of the Border was central to the talks and Barnier is at his most passionate when he describes his personal commitment to the peace process and his feelings when he met people in Northern Ireland.“I promised myself in this negotiation not to fuel the polemics and attacks from the British tabloids, to pay attention to the words I use, to stick to the facts, the figures, the legal fundamentals, in short, to leave little room for emotion and feelings, for the sake of objectivity. But here in Ireland . . . it is difficult not tobe touched by the sensitivity, the emotion of those who express themselves, the memories that remind me of this tragedy,” he writes.Barnier describes former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as “courageous”, praising his role in the abortion rights referendum. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is “always shrewd, methodical and well-informed” and Barnier singles out John Callinan from the Taoiseach’s office and Ireland’s former EU ambassador Declan Kelleher for praise.While May was hamstrung by the need to negotiate every step in the Brexit talks with her own party, Barnier maintained unity among the EU’s member-states by frequent visits to capitals and open channels of communication to the leaders.Johnson’s indifference to the truth and his pursuit of “dead cat” strategies and staged crises complicated the negotiations and when Frost opened the second phase of negotiations he told Barnier that the prime minister did not feel bound by the political declaration he agreed alongside the withdrawal agreement.The Internal Market Act, which included clauses that would have allowed the British government to unilaterally suspend the Northern Ireland protocol, was the trigger for Barnier’s final loss of trust in his negotiating partners. He suggests that Johnson waited until Donald Trump’s election defeat before withdrawing the offending clauses, fearful of their impact on his relationship with Joe Biden.La Grande Illusion – Journal secret du Brexit (2016-2020) is published by Gallimard.

Photograph:  Cecile ClocheretAFP via Getty ImagesFor some it’s the promise of free beer. For others a $100 payment may be sufficient enticement. Across the US state governors are coming up with innovative ways of encouraging people to get the coronavirus vaccine.As its vaccination programme has ramped up in recent weeks, the US faces a new problem – vaccine hesitancy, particularly among certain sections of the population.While almost 150 million people across the US have received at least one vaccine shot, the daily rate of vaccinations is slowing. The average number receiving a first jab or single dose J\u0026ampJ shot has fallen by 50 per cent since mid-April.To some extent this slowdown was expected. There was always going to be a rush of people desperate to get the jab once they became available. Now that this cohort has been vaccinated, a new challenge has emerged – trying to encourage those who are eligible to get vaccinated but have not done so.This week the White House signalled a shift in its approach to the vaccine rollout amid signs that supply is beginning to exceed demand.President Joe Biden announced a new plan to redirect vaccine supplies to rural communities. Mass vaccination sites will soon give way to smaller facilities closer to harder-to-reach Americans. Pharmacies will be directed to offer walk-in vaccinations, while mobile clinics will begin to operate. \u0026nbspSome states have taken matters into their own hands. West Virginia became the first to offer enticements to vaccine-wary residents. Republican governor Jim Justice announced that those aged between 16 and 35 will receive a $100 (€83) savings bond if they get vaccinated. The measure will be retroactive, so that all young West Virginians who have already got the jab will receive the payment. The effort is expected to cost the state about $27.5 million. “If we really want to move the needle, we’ve got to get our younger people vaccinated,” the governor said. Vaccination cardsNew Jersey’s governor Phil Murphy followed suit, announcing a “shot and beer” programme, whereby vaccinated adults who show their vaccination cards at participating outlets get a free beer.This week Washington DC’s mayor Muriel Bowser announced her own initiative, offering free beer to people receiving the J\u0026ampJ vaccine at an outdoor site on Thursday evening. The move was seen as an effort to increase vaccination amid concern about the low number of federal and private workers who have returned to their offices in DC.The efforts to ramp up vaccinations come as states across the country begin to reopen for the summer. While officials believe the main issue is access and information – Biden believes more people will get vaccinated once they hear about the benefits of their family and friends getting vaccinated– there is a core group of people who are resolutely in the anti-vax camp. Some of the resistance falls along partisan political lines. Americans who identify as Republicans are less likely to get the vaccine. A Monmouth poll last month found that 43 per cent of the party’s supporters would not get a Covid-19 jab. Fox News host Tucker Carlson has been busy promoting vaccine sceptic content.Further, while much attention was directed at the beginning of the vaccine rollout towards communities of colour who have had negative experience of government-driven treatments in the past, it now appears that many rural white communities may in fact be the most resistant to vaccination. Former presidentThese are also regions where Donald Trump is popular. Though the former president reportedly got the vaccine before he left the White House, notably he did not do so in public, like other political figures including former vice-president Mike Pence, House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell. Given that Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about Covid-19 last year helped fuel vaccine scepticism among many of his supporters, some public health figures, such as Dr Anthony Fauci, have called on the former president to use his influence to encourage supporters to get vaccinated.In the meantime, as the US prepares to expand eligibility for the Pfizer vaccine to 12 to15-year-olds as early as next week, Biden has set himself a new aim of vaccinating 70 per cent of adults by July 4th.The Biden administration is also mindful of the optics of the US sitting on surplus vaccines while much of the world is desperate for more supply. Biden has argued that his responsibility is to take care of American citizens first. Whether he can continue to make that argument once America passes peak demand is another question.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Comment: For the first time, I suspect that reports of Labour\u0026#39s death are not exaggeratedAfter the Hartlepool victory, Boris Johnson ponders how to lock in the UK\u0026#39s newfound Tory votersFrench authorities ban Jersey fishermen from landing their catch at three portsLabour frontbencher quits with broadside at Sir Keir Starmer after Hartlepool lossLocal elections 2021: Labour has \u0026#39lost connection\u0026#39 to voters, Keir Starmer admits after landmark Hartlepool defeatHolidaymakers face airport queues of up to eight hoursBugatti sells £200k \u0026#39self-levelling\u0026#39 table to superyacht owners who want to play pool at seaElectricity bills could be slashed in green drive to ditch gas boilersTripadvisor removes review of Auschwitz museumNicola Sturgeon set for clear election win but \u0026#39unlikely\u0026#39 to get SNP majority for indy ref twoComment: The ‘Boris Johnson factor’ underpinned the SNP\u0026#39s electoral successesDominic Cummings lashes out in all directions, with campaign critiques for Starmer and JohnsonHuge SNP drive to get supporters to polls cancelling out unionist tactical votingIrish soldier who allegedly joined Isil can enter UK because her father was born in BelfastNHS digital vaccine passport app will be ready by May 17Coronavirus latest news: Grant Shapps unveils Government\u0026#39s \u0026#39green list\u0026#39 of countriesDuchess of Cambridge sparks treasure hunt to find hidden lockdown picture booksPeter Phillips and estranged wife, Autumn, head to court over orce‘One shot’ Johnson \u0026amp Johnson Covid vaccine expected to be approved soonMay 2021 election results: the maps, charts and data of how your area voted across the UKMan admits trespassing at Buckingham Palace while carrying craft knifeBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bugatti sells 200k self levelling table superyacht owners want","story":"From the moment Ettore Bugatti launched his motor firm in 1909 his cars were famed for their style and sheer quality of their performance.But not even the Italian-born industrial designer could have anticipated the latest luxury product to be produced by his firm.Millionaires and oligarchs looking for a way to spend their excess cash can now buy a pool table for - of all places - their giant floating gin palaces and superyachts.For a mere £217,000 sophisticated computer technology will ensure the table remains perfectly level as their boat ploughs through the waters of the Mediterranean or the Persian Gulf.Already Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Emir of Abu Dhabi, is thought to have expressed an interest in buying one of the Bugatti pool tables for his 180m yacht, the £400 million Azzam.Only 30 of the limited edition pool tables will be manufactured by the French-based firm and they are all expected to sell out within days of being released over the coming weeks.Bugatti says the self-stabilising mechanism of the pool tables, made of precision carbon fibre, machined aluminum and corrosion-proof titanium, allows players to pot with ease as their yacht ploughs through the waves or sit moored in luxury marinas and island coves.The firm boasts that “an optional servo-driven system deploys a gyroscopic sensor to level the table” and that “each leg can move to compensate for the movement of a ship and remain perfectly level. The system can adjust in just five milliseconds, and the movement is completed in total silence with vibration-free adjustment”.The table’s ball pockets are made from stainless steel and are lined with the same leather used in Bugatti cars. As if that was not enough the tables come with a 13-inch, high-resolution touch screen to keep track of scores and the carbon fiber pool cues feature anodized and precision machined aluminum ends made to the same design of the buttons of Bugatti sports cars.Chris Cecil-Wright, one of London’s leading yacht brokers, said the pool table was the perfect accessory for owners looking to fit out their boats with whatever takes their fancy.“This is a lovely toy, perfect for people who are so immensely wealthy that if they can imagine something for their boat, whatever it is, then it’s possible,” he said.Mr Cecil-Wright, who has fitted ping-pong tables, basketball courts, mini-tennis and badminton courts to his clients’ boats, and even a gyroscope cabin designed to prevent seasickness, added: “If you can imagine it you can make it possible.”Other official Bugatti accessories with the pool table include a suitcase made in Bugatti leather to transport the set of Aramith Tournament Pro balls.Pedro Sanchez, General Manager at IXO, the Spanish carbon fibre specialists manufacturing the pool tables for Bugatti, said: “When we started developing the Bugatti Pool Table project, we knew we had to be different and excel in all areas in order to be extraordinary. Nothing has been spared.”The first five tables were snapped up within hours, with buyers including a Polish millionaire, a Canadian, two Dubai entrepreneurs and a collector who ordered one in the same colour as his £1.3m Bugatti Veyron sports car.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"call centres use pandemic excuse leaving us hold","story":"Call centres have used the pandemic as an excuse to leave customers waiting on the phone for double the amount of time they did in 2019, figures from Ofcom suggested.The telecoms regulator said the average wait for broadband customers looking to contact their providers had risen from just over two minutes in 2019 to just over four last year and that firms needed to do better.Many providers found their customer service operations disrupted at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak as they had to adapt to having call centre staff working from home.But Martyn James, of consumer complaints service Resolver, said customers are still being left on hold with companies continuing to use the pandemic as an excuse.“While everyone will have given them a certain amount of leeway at first, if there is any industry you would expect to get its act together quickly it would be telecoms,” he added.“Even now people are telling us about long waits and even difficulties finding a phone number for companies in the first place.”Waiting times for mobile companies had grown by around a minute, according to the figures.Ofcom said that, while many firms had been able to bring waiting times back down, “More than a year since the pandemic began, we expect performance to return to at least 2019 levels”.Lindsey Fussell, a director at the regulator, said: “Telecoms companies adapted quickly to meet soaring demand for their services last year – helping to keep the country connected.“But some have struggled with customer service problems. We’re challenging them to act now, so the telecoms industry becomes the gold standard for customer service.”Andrew Glover, chair of Ispa, the broadband providers’ trade body, said firms have worked “tirelessly” to support customers but pointed out that the industry had experienced record demand in the past year. Some 80 per cent of customers were satisfied with their provider, he said.Virgin Media had the longest waiting times of any broadband provider with an average of seven minutes and 40 seconds.A spokesman said it had to completely change how it works in 2020 but that providing customers with a great service is its “top priority”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"experts baffled rare grey whale named wally lost mediterranean","story":"Scientists are astounded and baffled that a grey whale - a species from the northern Pacific - has turned up in the Mediterranean and are now deeply concerned for its wellbeing so far from home.The whale, nicknamed Wally in reference to the children\u0027s book Where\u0027s Wally, has swapped its normal range - places like Baja California and Alaska - for Morocco, then Italy and now France.It is only the second time biologists have observed a grey whale in the Mediterranean. The last time was in 2010.With global warming opening northern routes, it is believed the whale became lost and swam into the Atlantic via the Arctic.We will probably see this more often because of climate change, which not only opened the northern route but is also changing ocean currents because of the melting of the ice caps, said Eric Hansen, head of the state bioersity agency in southern France.Scientists think that there may now be a breeding population in the Atlantic, decades after whalers hunted them to extinction. Wally was first spotted off Morocco and then in Italy’s Bay of Naples around the islands of Capri, Ischia and Ponza.The whale is around two years old and eight metres (26.25 ft) long. However, biologists are concerned about his rapid weight loss as he cannot find the invertebrates that are his normal food source in the depths of the Pacific.We are very worried about his future, as his fat, which is his fuel to travel, has gone down a lot. He is exhausted and just skin over bones. We have not seen him eat since we started tracking him, Mr Hansen told Reuters.Wally entered the Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar and followed the Moroccan coast before cutting across to Italian shores and then heading for France.Traveling 80 to 90 kilometres a day, he was spotted very close to the shore of Antibes and is now approaching the Spanish coast.It is trying to enter harbours, as if to find a way out. Its strategy should work and we hope it can make its way back to Gibraltar in about a week, said Mr Hansen.However, escape may not be so simple. A few days ago, Wally got caught in a fishing net off the Camargue coast but managed to free himself. There are concerns he may get confused by heavy shipping traffic in the Gibraltar Strait.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"german greens face mutiny use word germany manifesto","story":"The German Green Party may be leading in the polls, but it is facing a bizarre grassroots revolt over the use of the word “Germany” that may yet prove its undoing ahead of September\u0027s elections. Just four months before polls that the party has a real chance of winning for the first time ever, more than 3,000 members have backed a bid to delete any reference to Germany from the title of its manifesto.“At the heart of our politics are people in their dignity and freedom, not Germany,” said Michael Sebastian Schneiss, a party staffer who is one of those behind the rebellion. The move threatens to become an embarrassment for Annalena Baerbock, the Green candidate to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor, and was immediately seized on by the party’s political rivals.“If the Greens are so ashamed of Germany, why do they want to govern Germany?” Gordon Hoffmann of Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) wrote on Twitter.“The Greens are against Germany, but they want to be elected and rule here!?”, tweeted Volker Wiesing of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP). The Greens are currently leading the polls on 26 per cent, ahead of the CDU on 23 per cent, and have a genuine chance of winning and forming the next government for the first time in their history.But the prospect of members earnestly debating how relevant Germany is to them threatens to overshadow the party conference next month, and bring back memories of the bitter ideological infighting that used to ide the Greens.The party manifesto, unveiled to great fanfare last month, is currently entitled Germany: Everything is Here, but two motions have been submitted to the conference calling for it be changed to just Everything is Here.Some 3,000 members including regional MPs and candidates for September’s national elections have backed the motions, meaning they will have to be debated.“There are better words to describe our vision,” Julia Wimmer, one of the election candidates backing the motions told Tagesspiegel newspaper. “Of course I\u0027m not saying that I don\u0027t want to read or hear the word ‘Germany’ anywhere.“It’s going to be a hard party conference,” Robert Habeck, the joint party leader who, along with Ms Baerbock, is credited with bringing an end to feuding within the party, said this week. For decades, the Greens were ided by a power struggle between the pragmatic Realos, who were prepared to embrace the centre ground to win power, and the Fundis who insisted on a hardline ecological and Left-wing stance.When Ms Baerbock and Mr Habeck were named party leaders in 2017, the Realos widely considered to have won, and the party has since seen its support soar in the polls.But the hardliners have not gone away. The party youth wing recently released a position paper alleging “misanthropic ideologies” are rife in the German police and calling for a complete reorganisation.“I haven’t read so much stupidity in a long time,” commented Boris Pistories of the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD).More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day little large boris hartlepool","story":"Members of Hartlepool\u0027s business community erected a 30-foot inflatable model of Boris Johnson outside the count for the town\u0027s by-election, and the Prime Minister gamely posed for photos in front of it, buoyed by the Tories\u0027 success in the local electionsComment: For the first time, I suspect that reports of Labour\u0026#39s death are not exaggeratedAfter the Hartlepool victory, Boris Johnson ponders how to lock in the UK\u0026#39s newfound Tory votersFrench authorities ban Jersey fishermen from landing their catch at three portsLabour frontbencher quits with broadside at Sir Keir Starmer after Hartlepool lossLocal elections 2021: Labour has \u0026#39lost connection\u0026#39 to voters, Keir Starmer admits after landmark Hartlepool defeatHolidaymakers face airport queues of up to eight hoursBugatti sells £200k \u0026#39self-levelling\u0026#39 table to superyacht owners who want to play pool at seaElectricity bills could be slashed in green drive to ditch gas boilersTripadvisor removes review of Auschwitz museumNicola Sturgeon set for clear election win but \u0026#39unlikely\u0026#39 to get SNP majority for indy ref twoComment: The ‘Boris Johnson factor’ underpinned the SNP\u0026#39s electoral successesDominic Cummings lashes out in all directions, with campaign critiques for Starmer and JohnsonHuge SNP drive to get supporters to polls cancelling out unionist tactical votingIrish soldier who allegedly joined Isil can enter UK because her father was born in BelfastNHS digital vaccine passport app will be ready by May 17Coronavirus latest news: Grant Shapps unveils Government\u0026#39s \u0026#39green list\u0026#39 of countriesDuchess of Cambridge sparks treasure hunt to find hidden lockdown picture booksPeter Phillips and estranged wife, Autumn, head to court over orce‘One shot’ Johnson \u0026amp Johnson Covid vaccine expected to be approved soonMay 2021 election results: the maps, charts and data of how your area voted across the UKMan admits trespassing at Buckingham Palace while carrying craft knifeBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"portugal among 12 destinations international travel green list","story":"Portugal is the only major holiday destination to make the “green” list for quarantine-free travel with many of the other 11 countries still banning tourists or with tough restrictions.The move foreshadows a surge in bookings for holidays to Portugal, which has already seen flights double in price in anticipation of its inclusion on the green list.The limited list also provoked an angry reaction from the travel industry who demanded the Government indicate which countries could be included in the future reviews of the list, due every three weeks.The only other potential mainstream “holiday” destinations that made the “green” list are Iceland, Gibraltar and Israel, which have either limited capacity for tourists or place tough conditions for visitors.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, admitted the list - including Australia, New Zealand and Singapore which remain closed to foreign visitors - represented a “necessarily cautious” and “tentative” resumption of international travel from May 17.Other popular European destinations including Greece, France, Spain and Italy are on an amber list which requires any holidaymakers to quarantine for ten days on their return and take two PCR tests.Malta, the holiday island which had been expected to be on the green list, also only made amber but could turn green when the list is reviewed three weeks after the May 17 re-start of foreign travel.The only other countries or territories on the green list are Brunei, Faroe Islands, Falkland Islands, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands, St Helena, Ascension Island and Tristan de Cunha.Tourists are not permitted to visit Brunei or the Falkland Islands, while any visitors to the Faroe Islands are required to have a “special worthy purpose” for their trip.St Helena, Ascension Island and Tristan de Cunha have a mandatory 14-day quarantine period. Travellers arriving in South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands who are not fully vaccinated must self-isolate for seven days on arrival.Three countries - Turkey, the Males and Nepal - are added to the red list - which requires any Britons returning to the UK to quarantine for 10 days in Government approved hotels at a cost of £1,750 per person.At a Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps defended the cautious approach: We in this country have managed to construct a fortress against Covid. But the disease is still prevalent in other parts of the world, most notably at the moment in India.In fact, more new cases of Covid have been diagnosed around the world in the last seven days than at any time since the pandemic began.That\u0027s why today\u0027s announcement, removing the stay in the UK restrictions from May 17, is necessarily cautious. We must make absolutely sure that the countries we reconnect with are safe, that their infection rates are low and their vaccination rates are high.It means making sure we are not incubating the most dangerous variants that they\u0027re not and that they have safe and secure surveillance in place.Mr Shapps indicated that there would be more countries added to the “green” list throughout the summer. It will be reviewed every three weeks from May 13, although Government sources are still being cautious about whether popular destinations such as France, Italy, Greece and Spain would be added by the end of June.In the meantime, Mr Shapps urged Britons to avoid travel to “amber” list countries as he warned that the extra border checks which all holidaymakers face on their return would mean longer queues at airports. “You should not be travelling to these places right now,” he said.By contrast, Portugal is gearing up for a major reopening of travel after May 17 when it will only require Britons to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test result.There was already a spike in prices this week for flights to Portugal after the Foreign Office ditched its advice against non-essential travel to the country.British Airways was on Thursday night charging £530 for a flight from Heathrow to the Algarve on May 17, compared with £234 for the same route two days earlier.A Ryanair flight from Stansted to Portugal\u0027s capital Lisbon on May 17 was £152, compared with £15 on May 16. And EasyJet was charging £234 for a flight from Luton to the Algarve on May 17, but just £73 the following day.Two of the other green list “holiday” destinations still have restrictions. Israel will only accept vaccinated holidaymakers and requires a test for biological proof of it. Travel to Israel is expected to be limited to select group tours from May 23 and only open to independent tourists from July.Iceland requires even vaccinated travellers to quarantine until they have taken a PCR test to prove they are negative for Covid. Other visitors are required to take a test on arrival and quarantine until a second negative test result on day five or six.Gibraltar will allow in Britons without a PCR test, but has limited capacity for any surge in tourists.The list provoked strong criticism from the aviation and travel industry after a year in which foreign travel has been largely at a standstill.Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: “It is disappointing that so few countries are on the green list. This is not yet the meaningful, four-nation restart UK airports and the economy need.”Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said: “This is a missed opportunity and with so few countries making it onto the green list represents a reopening of air travel in name only.“By contrast the EU has said vaccinated people will be able to travel without restrictions which leaves the UK at risk of falling behind and not opening up international travel to key markets across Europe as well as the United States.”EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren called on the Government to provide clarity about which countries could be added to its green travel list.Gloria Guevera, head of the World Travel \u0026amp Tourism Council said: “After suffering the biggest fall in contribution towards GDP from travel and tourism of the 10 most important global markets - by a staggering 62.5 per cent - the UK can ill-afford to be this cautious.”What are the entry rules for green and amber destinations? Travellers should check requirements on the Foreign Office travel advice gov.uk website. Much of Europe will require a negative PCR test result for entry andor proof of vaccination or immunity through having had the virus. Some green list countries such as Australia and New Zealand are closed to most arrivals.Where do I get a test for my holiday, and when should I book?There are two options: ordering a home test kit or booking an appointment at a clinic or drive-through test centre. Test providers are expecting a surge in customers when travel opens up, so if you need a test for your destination, book as soon as possible.Where can I get a return test, and when should I book it?Holidaymakers returning from “green list” destinations will be required to take a test within 72 hours before they arrive back in the UK. This can be a lateral flow test. These are free to order through gov.uk.You will then need to take a PCR test on or before the second day of your return. These should be booked as soon as possible once you have reserved your holiday. Costs are coming down to £60 per test, with TUI offering it for £20 to green list destinations.Which countries will be in demand and will prices increase?Portugal is the only main popular European holiday destination on the quarantine free green list, as Spain, France, Italy and Greece have been categorised as “amber” under the traffic light system.There may be interest in amber list countries for those prepared to quarantine and in Gibraltar, Israel and Iceland. However, it is searches for “Portugal holidays” that have already increased 110 per cent over the past seven days.Airlines operate systems where prices rise in line with demand. However, tour operators may be less likely to increase their costs.Emma Coulthurst from TravelSupermarket said: “There weren’t price hikes for package holidays last summer and package holiday providers need to sell holidays. It is in the industry’s interest to get people away. TUI, for example, has said this morning... that its packages are in line with last year’s prices and that it won’t be looking to put up prices.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists want people keep working home indefinitely","story":"Government scientists want people to work from home indefinitely, even though the latest data suggests the roadmap out of Covid lockdown is on track.The latest figures show infection levels are now the lowest they have been for eight months, with just one in 1,180 people in England having Covid.Next week, the  Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to publish more data showing the impact of Britain\u0027s vaccine programme, with cases dropping despite the reopening of outdoor hospitality and non-essential shops and the return of schools.The projections will also examine the impact of the next steps, with sources suggesting any increase in cases is not expected to be on the scale of previous virus waves.After the roadmap was published, related modelling suggested a full release of restrictions in June could trigger a new wave of hospitalisations as bad as the January peak.The latest modelling – taking in a slew of data including research showing that one vaccine dose can cut virus transmission by half – is expected to paint a far more positive picture. But Government scientists are understood to be concerned that progress could be undermined if people return to work in significant numbers, increasing social contact. They are calling for those who can work from home to continue doing so, saying employers should plan so that staff can stay at home or spend limited time in the office until the threat of the global pandemic recedes. One source said there was no reason to return to an office full-time after June 21 if work could be carried out at home. Boris Johnson is expected to set out the next stages in the exit from lockdown next week, with people allowed to mix indoors in groups of up to six or two households, and pubs and restaurants allowed to serve indoors from May 17.Under the current timetable, limits on social distancing will be lifted on June 21, but the Government has yet to set out policies about the return of workers to the office. A decision on whether face masks will be required on public transport has also yet to be taken. Modelling produced for the Government suggests people will not go back to pre-pandemic levels of contact with others as restrictions lift. Papers released by Sage on Friday show that last August, people were still only at about 50 percent of their pre-pandemic contact levels with other people.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz social media platform has upheld","story":"In the week that a row over post-Brexit fishing rights between the UK and France escalated, the \u0027s weekly news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to this week\u0027s headlines.A G7 meeting took place in London this week, but the foreign minister of which country was forced to pull out of attending the meeting in person after two Covid-19 cases were detected in the nation\u0027s travelling delegation?In America, the oversight board of which social media giant has upheld a ban on former US president Donald Trump from using the platform?If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters you will have come across all of the answers to the quiz.

Back in London, which arguably tells you everything you need to know about his continued failure to reconnect with a Red Wall that is now bluer than an episode of The Smurfs.After a year of reminding everyone he is not Jeremy Corbyn, SurrKeir was hoping for cut-through but instead he appeared to be largely cut dead up North. Working-class voters clearly don’t take kindly to seeing an overly Brylcreemed politician poncing about in John Lewis when the pubs remain closed for indoor pints. Starmer appeared so ridiculous eyeing up that gold wallpaper precisely because he is the ultimate “magnolia” politician who stands for everything and nothing.While Labour childishly drones on about all that is wrong with the world, without seemingly doing a jot about it, the Tories have managed to vaccinate more than half the adult population. These things do not go unnoticed by the electorate, which is probably why no one could be bothered to make a Starmer blimp.But as he once again basks in post-election glory, the Prime Minister must seize the moment to move his premiership into its next, and most important, phase.We have sat through the lively and upbeat first movement of the Boris opera, the “campaign” piece, featuring players such as Australian political strategist Lynton Crosby and Dominic Cummings (until he came over all Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard). Johnson hit all the right notes as he persuaded the British public that he would “get Brexit done” and eviscerate “that crazed Communist”.Then came a pandemic-sized interval, when the leading man was stretchered off stage, leaving the rest of the cast lost for words in his absence. Amid scenes of chaos and confusion, the middle “managerial” movement finally swept in with a new team of productive staff taking centre stage. Whitehall’s “safest pair of hands” Simon Case was appointed Cabinet Secretary while former Merrill Lynch banker Dan Rosenfield replaced Lord “Steady Eddie” Udny-Lister as Johnson’s chief of staff. With a cameo from Kate Bingham, who led the Government’s vaccine task force, the Boris Show was back on track – and following Thursday’s local election results, it is now being asked to perform an encore.Yet as any discerning opera fan knows, it is this next movement that really matters.For ultimately, Johnson is not going to be judged on all that has gone before – but on what happens in the final act of his administration as it enters the post-Covid era and attention switches to him winning a second term in office.If the Tories are going to make their advances in places like Hartlepool stick then there is only so long the Prime Minister can continue to belt out slogans about “levelling up” and “building back better” without providing the rest of the script.Having put their trust in the Tories, many for the first time, voters in the Midlands and the North will want to see some improvement in their lives and local areas by the time the next general election rolls around. However, it is not clear that anybody in No 10 has any idea how Johnson’s soundbites will translate into action. And if appointing Harborough MP-turned-lockdown-zealot Neil O’Brien to do some of the thinking is the answer, then it is time to look again at their cast list.As with any performance, the chances of a standing ovation depend on the star soloist – but also those in support in the wings. If Johnson is going to be remembered like his hero Churchill, then those accompanying him not only have to read his mood music but also play all the right notes.Currently, there is no Lennon to his McCartney, which remains an ongoing problem inside No 10. It is frankly staggering that the Prime Minister ended up as a lone voice in Downing Street on lockdown, so frustrated by the lack of support that he was allegedly left to vent in his office about rather seeing “bodies piled high in their thousands” than shutting down the economy again last October.Although Tories will hardly be surprised at the lack of loyalty from the likes of Michael Gove, who stabbed his former Vote Leave running mate in the front during the 2016 leadership race, it seems a sorry state of affairs that there is no Osborne to Johnson’s Cameron no Campbell to Johnson’s Blair.Being anything but beige (unlike his Opposition rival), the Prime Minister has always been rather difficult to manage. Leadership is a lonely place as it is, but throughout his time behind the black door, Johnson appears to have been surrounded by very few people who seem to understand him. It is partly his own fault, since at times he appears more inscrutable than the Queen playing poker in Ray-Bans. His penchant for quietly contemplating the options before him without seemingly giving a firm indication of his preference was once described by a Cabinet minister as a form of “Japanese silence”.Yet when he was at City Hall, there were experienced and influential people like Sir Lynton, the late great, Simon Milton, and the spin doctor Will Walden who knew how to read him. His ex-wife Marina Wheeler also knew what made him tick – but the power base in Downing Street has shifted to allies of his fiancée Carrie Symonds, like Henry Newman and Meg Powell-Chandler who, while they may be competent advisers, could hardly be described as Boris whispherers. This must change if the PM is to achieve his dream of a legacy of longevity.I understand No 10 has already been subtly casting the net for long standing allies to return to the fold in a bid to decode and implement Johnson’s political ideology. The recruitment of HM’s highly regarded former private secretary Lord Geidt is certainly a step in the right direction. Having spent a decade reading the monarch’s mind and dealing with squabbles between the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, he should find Downing Street a doddle. The former intelligence officer has just been taken on as the independent adviser on ministers’ interests – but he may well be minded to put the Prime Minister’s interests at the top of his in-tray.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"elections 2021 uks future hangs","story":"NewsElections : UKs future hangs in balance as SNP majority too close to callNicola Sturgeon is battling for an outright majority at the Holyrood elections to secure another independence referendummirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political EditorLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY NewsNicola Sturgeon is gunning for an outright majority in the Holyrood elections \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is bidding for an outright majority to boost her claim for another independence referendum.But she played played down the likelihood of an overall SNP majority at Holyrood earlier in the day, saying it has always been a very, very long shot.The final result is expected on Saturday, with the SNP claiming the bulk of the declared seats on Friday night. Some  seats are needed to secure a clear majority. See the latest results below By pm, the party had won  out of  declared seats for the -seat Scottish Parliament. The SNP picked up seats in East Lothian and Ayr as well as scooping former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidsonaposs Edinburgh Central seat. But Labouraposs Jackie Baillie held on to her Dumbarton constituency - the most marginal seat in Scotland - and a top target for the SNP. Ms Baillie had a majority of just  from the  Holyrood election, but she increased that to , on Friday. Labour also held Edinburgh Southern, while the Lib Dems retain four seats, including Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands, North East Fe and Edinburgh Western.The Tories have kept three seats - Eastwood, Dumfriesshire, and Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire. Speaking at her count in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon signalled her plan to press ahead with demanding another independence vote. She said: “At this stage I am extremely happy that the SNP appears to be on course for a fourth consecutive election victory, and to be on course to have the privilege of forming a government again. “If that is indeed the outcome of this election, I pledge today to get back to work immediately, to continue to steer this country through the crisis of Covid, to lead this country into recovery from Covid – and then, when the time is right, to offer this country the choice of a better future.” "},{"url":null,"title":"just four countries uk travel","story":"NewsJust four countries on UK travel green list will let Brits in without quarantiningOnly Portugal, including the Azores and Madeira, and Gibraltar are fully open to Brits without quarantining - with Iceland and Israel also not enforcing isolation but requiring holidaymakers to be vaccinatedmirrorShareCommentsByDave BurkeNews reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.dailystar video grant-shapps-reveals-countries-uks-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:GDtRvZz,jwPlayerMediaID:KqPbje,suggestedData:,gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

But before excited tourists packing their bags and book a flight, itaposs important to note that heading to some of these destinations will mean they must spend the first few days of their trip isolating - and some will not let them in at all. Only Portugal, including the Azores and Madeira, and Gibraltar are open to Brits without quarantining - with Iceland and Israel also not enforcing isolation but requiring holidaymakers to be vaccinated. Despite being on the green list, people will not be able to go on holiday to Australia, New Zealand or Singapore, as they are closed to UK tourists. People arriving in the Faroe Islands are required to take a test on arrival and self-isolate for  days, although there is an option to release after four days with a PCR test. Foreigners touching down in Brunei will have to pay £ for a Covid test, and can be made to quarantine for up to two weeks, according to latest travel advice. Andyouaposre heading to the Falkland Islands, itaposs best to book a long break as visitors are expected to self-isolate for a period of  days after arrival.

Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. The countries were selected because of low Covid infection rates, good progress with vaccinations and the absence of known mutant strains. However the government has advised holidaymakers to be cautious as regulations could changethe situation in any of the countries worsens. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the removal of international travel restrictions was necessarily cautious and that the Government must make absolutely sure the countries the UK reconnects with are safe. He said: We in this country have managed to construct a fortress against Covid. But the disease is still prevalent in other parts of the world, most notably at the moment in India.  In fact, more new cases of Covid have been diagnosed around the world in the last seven days than at any time since the pandemic began. He added: Thataposs why todayaposs announcement, removing the stay in the UK restrictions from May , is necessarily cautious. We must make absolutely sure that the countries we reconnect with are safe, that their infection rates are low and their vaccination rates are high. It means making sure we are not incubating the most dangerous iants that theyaposre not and that they have safe and secure surveillance in place.

Crushing defeat in Hartlepool, lost council seats and failing to take back mayoral posts from Boris Johnsonaposs Conservatives leaves Labour still tumbling down an already queasily high electoral mountain. What Labour must do to win again isnapost easy but to start a national conversation here are eight ideas to get the talking started: . What is Labour for  Fundamental yet too many voters donapost know and when they do, donapost like it. Starmer must paint in vivid colours the fairer, stronger, better, more prosperous country heaposd build. The NHS is Labouraposs greatest, most enduring gt to the nation but it needs to offer more than championing a single public service. . Good Policies The perception Labour lacks policies is the ugly twin of too many voters ignorant of what it stands for. Practical, attractive plans and ideas to improve lives that can be shouted from roof tops would fill gaps. . Be Relevant Here the party has to appeal to people in jobs as well as the jobless, self-employed and employed, middle earners and low waged, private and not just public sector workers plus the old alongside the young. One Labour MP complained too many of his constituents thought it represented only benefit claimants and migrants. Thataposs a bigoted caricature and both groups deserve representation anyway but it must appeal to self-interest as much as altruism.  . Optimism Beats Pessimism Be upbeat about the potential of people and Britain and what could be achieved. The triumphant can-do spirit is infectious. The historic mindset of the Left is failures, sell-outs and betrayals. When the countryaposs riddled with injustices and inequalities, families and communities held back, this isnapost a moment for champagne but Labour optimism for change would go a long way. . Culture Matters Locally and nationally, many take pride in their area and the nation. Criticism of Starmer for appearing on TV with union flags is ludicrous. Tories focus on statues to ert people. Brexit serves a similar role. Redefine patriotism as championing British values of fairness and decency - and stop the Tories hijacking flags.

But a Labour source today told the Mirror the London race was definitely closer than people were thinking.The source insisted that, despite polls putting Mr Khan comfortably ahead, we always said it would be a close election. Under Londonaposs election rules, the top two candidates in the first round will then go through to a second round, and pick up any second-preference votes from people who voted for smaller parties. Mr Khanaposs team still appeared to believe heaposs likely to triumph on second preferences, however.  The source said: There is no question we are seeing signicant impact from turnout and voters believing they could put a smaller party first preference without influencing the election result. There are still half of London boroughs to count and it’s too early to say anything with any certainty at this stage. And Pollster Chris Curtis, of Opinium, tweeted on Friday night: If Shaun Bailey gets elected Mayor of London I will run around City Hall naked. A YouGov poll this week had tipped Mr Khan to win % in the first round and Mr Bailey % - narrowing the gap between the pair by five points. However, YouGov had said an upset looked unlikely as in the second round, Mr Khan would triumph with % compared to Mr Baileyaposs %. As of .pm on Friday, Mr Khan had around % of the first-round votes counted compared to Mr Baileyaposs % - although that included earlier-declaring, Tory-voting outer boroughs in the capital so is not a reliable tally. The Times reported tonight that Mr Baileyaposs campaign believed he could actually win the London mayoralty. Another source close to the Tory appeared less optimistic, though, telling the Guido Fawkes blog: It’s closer than everyone thinks. Still a long way to go though, but Shaun will have beaten the polls by a fair whack. The speculation comes despite a string of gaffes by Mr Bailey, including claiming people would spend a Universal Basic Income on lots of drugs.  It comes after Keir Starmer said he would do whatever it takes to rebuild after a bitterly disappointing defeat in the Hartlepool by-election. Tory Jill Mortimer snatched the seat from Labour with a majority of nearly , votes in a stunning victory for Boris Johnson.And there was further misery for the party in the local elections as Labour lost control of Harlow, Rossendale and Sheffield councils - and failed to make any major gains as the first results came in. The result sparked immediate recriminations, with Labouraposs left wing piling in to criticise Mr Starmeraposs leadership. In a terse statement, he said: Iaposm bitterly disappointed in the result and I take full responsibility for the results - and I will take full responsibility for fixing this. We have changed as a party but we havenapost set out a strong enough case to the country.

I was surprised to find around  women from both sides of the sectarian ide talking about the things they had in common. The decent education no one’s child was getting, the state of the local health service. The fact their kids were growing up surrounded by violence. Instead of focusing on the issues that ided them, these women were working together to get things done in the common good. As Hartlepool joins the long list of towns land-sliding away from Labour, another brick in a red wall fallen into a Tory sea, Labour needs to start a similar process. The Left’s civil war may only appear to be political, but every day out of power is costing lives, livelihoods and futures just the same. The answer to losing Hartlepool is neither to expel Momentum or get the first bus back to Corbynism. It is to ask young politan voters to sit with older town-based voters and thrash out a party and policies they could both agree on. Three blindingly obvious examples spring to mind. A Green jobs revolution in Labour’s former industrial heartlands that would combine the younger part of the movement’s desire for huge environmental change and bring jobs to held back and long neglected areas. Post-pandemic is the perfect time to rip up the rule book on public spending to challenge the climate emergency. And at their heart, towns just really want to flourish again, after years of decline. Secondly, an all-out attack on the gig economy. This should be at the absolute heart of Labour’s policies as gig corporates roll back the clock on labour rights and reforms to pre-Victorian times. Gig jobs are ruining the lives of care-workers in Hartlepool just the same as Deliveroo riders in Bristol. A shared agenda for change could immediately alter people’s lives meaningfully for the better. Thirdly, the rebuilding of a health and social care service fit for the roaring s and beyond, and that meets the challenges of an ageing population with dignity for both carers and the cared for. To achieve this, Labour needs to be once again a party of all the talents, dominated neither by one faction or another. Witness Joe Biden’s confident leadership, that has brought in people from across the Democratic spectrum. Witness also his economic radicalism. Just as Trump’s radicalism has ripped open politics in the US, the radicalism of Brexit has done the same in the UK, paving the way for new ideas. It’s not good enough for Labour to keep saying it is listening. The party needs to engage in active listening. It’s not good enough to sit in a pub with people and then just take back the things you already knew. This week I spoke to a man in Cumbria for our Britain Talks project who said he was now backing coal tobecause he’d given up hope of ever getting green jobs to his dying town.

And in the Tees Valley mayoral contest, Conservative incumbent Ben Houchen trounced his Labour rival by a landslide, with % of votes to %. The West Midlands mayoral result, due on Saturday, could pile on the agony for Labour as Tory strategists are confident of victory for reigning mayor Andy Street. Even London’s mayor race, where Sadiq Khan had been set to romp home by a wide margin, is “definitely closer” than people thought, sources admit.   A fresh ballot box meltdown across England saw electors switch to the Conservatives following  years of Tory rule from Westminster – prompting another round of Labour soul-searching and tough questions for Mr Starmeraposs -month premiership. But the results are not all rosy for the Tories - whose vote share in Scotland was actually down in early counting. With the SNP gaining three Holyrood seats in early results, Nicola Sturgeon appeared to be inching close to a majority in the Scottish Parliament. That would allow her to launch a fresh and brutal push for independence - which could split the UK apart within just a few years. Results were also mixed for Labour, who appeared to be doing better in the Welsh Parliament election than they were in England.

ENGLISH COUNCILS: More than , seats were up for grabs on  county,  unitary,  metropolitan and  district councils in England. Results across the country showed the Tories doing very well at Labouraposs expense - despite many of the seats that were up for election being lost by Labour last time. Labour lost a whopping  seats in traditional bellwether Nuneaton and Bedworth. The Tories snatched Harlow in Essex from Labour after seven seats changed hands and took Northumberland from no overall control. Dudley - where Labour and the Tories were practically neck and neck before - went to the Tories with a massive cull of red seats. Conservatives now have  seats, almost double Labouraposs .

WELSH PARLIAMENT: All  seats were up for grabs and polls suggested Labour - while the biggest party - had an uphill struggle to win an overall majority. But the party was not suffering the collapse many feared, or that was seen in England. Only one of Walesapos so-called red wall seats, the Vale of Clwyd, fell to the Welsh Conservatives in early counting while Labour held Wrexham. Labour sources were also confident of unseating the former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in Rhondda. Results Friday afternoon and evening.  ENGLISH MAYORS: The biggest battles were over Tory-held West Midlands, Tees Valley and West of England, but Labouraposs hopes of making in-roads were fading fast. Tory Ben Houchen scored a massive victory in Tees Valley while Tory sources were confident of taking West Midlands.

He has vowed to go further and faster in breaking from the Corbyn project - saying Labour has lost the trust of working people in places like Hartlepool. But that promise has angered the Labour left, who say Labour must now set out what it stands for and unveil policies that inspire the electorate. Sir Keir is expected to reshuffle his Shadow Cabinet and said today: Iaposm bitterly disappointed in the result and I take full responsibility for the results - and I will take full responsibility for fixing this. We have changed as a party but we havenapost set out a strong enough case to the country.  Very often we have been talking to ourselves instead of to the country and we have lost the trust of working people, particularly in places like Hartlepool. I intend to do whatever is necessary to fix that. Yet pressed repeatedly by journalists, Sir Keir failed to set out what actual policies he will use to inspire voters. Here, four MPs from radically dferent wings of the party give their view to the Mirror on what he should do next. John McDonnell: aposBlaming Corbyn wonapost washapos  When a political party loses an election like Hartlepool, it needs to have a deep and honest look at itself.Still trying to blame Jeremy Corbyn just won’t wash. First, he won Hartlepool in both the  and  elections and, second, he hasn’t been leader of the Labour Party for over a year. The reality is that with % of the people of Hartlepool voting for Brexit in , this issue still hung over the byelection.Plus, in a time of national crisis like the pandemic people do naturally rally round the government.Of course, Boris Johnson has also exploited the wonderful dedication and hard work of NHS workers in rolling out the vaccination programme to boost his own position. The fact that these NHS workers are the very people who are being insulted by him with a % pay offer is a disgrace.Apart from these special factors, the main problem for Labour in these elections was that people simply did not know what Labour stood for. Where Labour had strong mayoral candidates standing on strong local manestos, they secured a decent vote. Elsewhere the lack of any national party policy programme that explained Labour’s aims and ambitions meant people had no motivation or incentive to vote Labour. For a year the central message from Labour was nothing more than that it was under new leadership.  To win future elections any leadership must inspire voters by the vision of the society they want to create and the policies that will achieve it. Labour now needs to start that work urgently. That means Labour as a party rooted in our local communities, with a policy programme to tackle the bread and butter issues our people face and armed with a vision of the fairer, heathier, and greener Britain we aim Io create Wes Streeting: aposWeaposve taken too many voters for grantedapos  When you’ve slogged your guts out knocking on doors during an election campaign, there’s nothing more comforting than a nice warm bath. The Labour Party’s problem is that every time we lose elections, we always reach for the nice warm bath of reassuring excuses, instead of the cold shower of recognising why we lost and taking the action needed to win again. There’s a lot of focus on Hartlepool. But we took a beating in other areas of England, too. Keir Starmer ’s response to those results shows that he’s got the message. He understands the scale of Labour’s challenge and is up to meeting it.The question is, will Labour finally listen, learn and change  This is the first time in years that I’ve knocked on doors and the Leader of the Labour Party has been such a positive with voters. But as we’ve seen in England and Scotland, a change of leader isn’t enough. We have to prove that the Labour Party itself has changed. What do our defeats, under very dferent leaders, have in common  The voters think our priorities are not their priorities. They suspect our heart’s in the right place, but they’re not convinced our head is in the right place, too. It needs saying: Labour has taken too many voters for granted. Under successive leaders. Because we haven’t put voters’ concerns ahead of our own Party’s concerns. But we can, and must, turn that around. First, we must own up to this and admit our mistakes. Next, with Keir’s leadership, we put it right. That is the only way we move forward to winning ways. The only route back to Government for Labour. No more navel gazing. Time for action. Lloyd Russell-Moyle: aposWe need to become a left coalitionapos  Geographies donapost vote, people do. When we say traditional Labour heartland what we mean is traditional Labour people. On a night where Labour failed to regain areas we lost in  and didn’t break through in some of the southern and shire seats we needed traditional Labour people and new Labour people alike were cold on the current Labour brand. This is not unique to Labour, we see across western democracies Social Democrat parties which once relied on the coalition of blue collar workers and metropolitan liberals has fallen apart. How has this happened  Those of us on the left often say Labouraposs policies are very popular on economic, health, education issues Labour is much closer to the people than the Conservatives. After  years of austerity, however, there is a limit to how much local councils can blame Westminster for failing services and the voters buying the central government bogy man argument. That should mean in Conservative shires we are pushing at an open door full of potholes and closed libraries but in industrial and urban centres where Labour has traditionally ruled it was always going to be an uphill struggle. Social issues are proving dficult for Labour too. The Greens have managed to start to hit that sweet spot, their vote has rocketed and here in East Sussex they are taking seats.Only Joe Biden in the USA has managed to get the coalition back together. The USA’s “Uncle Joe” is able to be right-on social issues like Trans Rights without being woke, put forward relatively radical economic policies such as a  h federal minimum wage or a national broadband network and change the conversation around Trade Unions and industrial rebirth capturing forgotten and left behind communities.If Keir and Labour wants success, we need to revaluate how we build that coalition, doubling down on “new leadership” or flag waiving without the actual values of progressive patriotism will ring hollow and the voters have seen it. If Labour is also to survive we need to start to consider ourself not the Labour Party but the Labour Parties, geographically independent London, Scotland, Welsh, Cornish or Yorkshire parties but also an honest coalition of many outlooks: Greens, Momentum, Progress, Cooperative Party standing candidates under the Labour brand.

She took , votes, a majority of , over Labouraposs Dr Paul Williams. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section The heavens opened shortly after Johnson embarked on his victory tour here, doing a photo call with farmeraposs daughter Jill on the marina. Before today, the very words aposConservative MP for Hartlepoolapos would have seemed impossible. It does not rain but it pours for Labour as the Prime Minister rejoiced in yet another demolition job on the former aposRed Wallapos of Labour-held constituencies.Peter Cook, , a lelong Labour voter before the  General election, a trade unionist and former shop steward, said: The biggest mistake Labour made here was when they brought in a rejected former MP from Stockton who had supported Remain and attacked people who wanted to come out of Europe. I was disgusted, Brexit was the big issue for me - the vast majority of the town rejected staying in Europe.Pardon my French, I think Boris Johnson has made a right b**** of it especially for the fishing industry in this country. I had previously voted Labour, but I donapost knowI will vote for them again in my letime. And he warned Keir Starmer that he needed to get out of the Westminster bubble - and fast. I am not interested in Borisapos wallpaper, he said. We need to look at where things are going wrong.  There was a time when two steelworks here, we had engineering, we used to make things. Not any more. We canapost let China produce everything. We want aposcan doapos politicians who get things done -Labour had good ideas, people would vote for them. His next door neighbour on the historic town wall, William Crask, , a dad-of-two and production operator, had the same message.

The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  Labour has lost its way, he said. I am a working man, and the fact is that they donapost represent me anymore. They are for public servants, the middle class, people on benefits. Butyou are a working class person, in a normal job, they just donapost seem to care. I did not vote Labour last time when I had before, because I was for Brexit.  But it is not just about that, they donapost talk about investment, they donapost seem to have any policies, they donapost have a vision. Boris makes mistakes but he is just himself, and people donapost seem too worried about his faults.I voted for Tony Blair Labour went wrong with Ed instead of David Miliband.It was all downhill from there. The Labour party is trying to please everybody, and pleasing nobody.  Brexit is done, gone, and we need to move on from that. We need jobs, investment, not just all mouth and no action. Actions speak louder than words. In her victory speech, Jill Mortimer warned Labour had taken local people for granted for too longapos. Many agreed with that view, and spoke of the work of Tees mayor Ben Houchen in bringing investment to the area. Elizabeth Maughan, , a mum-of-three who works in a local newsagent, did not vote for Labour this time because she was so aposdisillusionedapos.  We have so much anti-social behaviour where we live, people smashing windows, and I am working and paying full council tax, she said. I have always voted Labour - my mother would be turning in her grave - but they have not done anything for Hartlepool. I could not vote Tory mind. Outside the Pot House pub, a popular spot with beautul views out over the town harbour, there were many who had turned Tory, however. Frank Boagey, , a retired steel erector who paid his union dues during a -year career, turned his back on Labour for the first time in  after lelong support.  All my family were fishermen, there was no way I was going to vote against Brexit, he said. This is not a dictatorship. The people of Hartlepool voted to leave the EU and Labour would not go with the majority view, which is what you do in a democracy. Mandelson was an embarrassment for me and so were the last two Labour MPs. If you had given Peter Mandelson a pin, he could not have found Hartlepool on the map before he came here and now he is Lord Mandelson of Hartlepool, it really is a joke. They kept on dropping people in here who know nothing about the place, taking the voters for granted.  I was a trade unionist for  years and voted Labour for  years and suddenly thought aposwhat have they done for me apos Retired local Government officer Edith Ward, , a great grandmother, was one of the few dissenting voices. But she was not surprised that Labour lost, and urged the party to do more to win back the traditional working class voters. I think people have forgotten all the huge mistakes made at the start of the pandemic, the thousands of lives lost as a result of those mistakes, she said. I voted against Boris. But Labour have got to try harder to win this back, and prove they are better than people think right now.  They do need to make a change. Her friend Ann Murray, , a retired office clerk, great grandmother and former Labour voter, went for a local candidate as she felt more needed to be done aposfor the North eastapos. Independent Sam Lee took her vote and , others, with . percent overall, as Tories took huge gains from the , who voted Brexit last time. Hartlepool-born Christine Appleyard, , on a visit to see her school friend Julie Sladen, , described the result as a aposbloody tragedyapos.

Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: I congratulate Jill Mortimer on her victory, but it was for me, as a Labour Party member, absolutely shattering to see a Conservative MP elected in a place like Hartlepool after nearly  years.I think what this shows is that, although we have started to change since the cataclysm of the last general election, that change has clearly not gone far enough in order to win back the trust of the voters, and weaposve just seen that in spades in Hartlepool.Labour MP Diane Abbott, who was shadow home secretary during Jeremy Corbynaposs leadership, branded it a crushing defeat for Labour and urged Sir Keir to rethink his strategy. She tweeted: Not possible to blame Jeremy Corbyn for this result. Labour won the seat twice under his leadership.

Around a third of people with coronavirus show no symptoms, so can infect others without even knowing they’ve been ill. Rapid testing is a vital tool to make sure people know when to self isolate so they break the chain of transmission. Alex, , from Hemel Hempstead, works for JamVans, a removal company that provides Covid- tests for its employees. He was experiencing no symptoms at all when he tested positive for Covid. “We move people’s homes on a daily basis, and also have a delivery contract with a local hospice – it has about  charity stores, and we help them move all the stock,” says Alex. “One morning before work I did a rapid Covid- test outside the hospice, then sat in my van waiting for the results. I’d done a few of these tests, and thought it would be fine as I didn’t have a single symptom – but then the test came back positive.”  “I spoke to the hospice on the phone from outside the building, and they told me I had to go for a PCR test. My company booked me in with a private firm and I went straight there. Our company policy is that we have to wear a mask in people’s houses and throughout our offices, and I stick to the guidelines as much as I can, so at first I thought the rapid flow test must be wrong. But within an hour, I was told I definitely had Covid. I couldn’t quite believe it.” Alex was able to isolate straightaway, ensuring he wasn’t spreading Covid to any vulnerable people he came into contact with. “I stopped working to self-isolate on full pay, and still didn’t develop any symptoms at all,” he says. “Without the test, I definitely would have carried on working, which is why it’s so important to have regular tests, evenyou haven’t got any symptoms. I had the virus and I felt fine, but imagineI’d given it to my parents, my grandparents or my colleagues  “If I’m driving between  charity shops, with three or four people in each shop, I could have been quite a spreader. I would have put a lot of people at risk, who may not be as young and healthy as I am – you never know who you’re passing it on to. It might sound dramatic, but in my case, taking the test could have saved lives. I haven’t had the jab yet, but I will as soon as I can – and I’ll still be taking two tests a week.Get into the testing habit More than half the adults in the UK have had at least one dose of Covid vaccination and lockdown restrictions are beginning to ease. But the virus is still out there and around a third of all the people who are infected do not show any symptoms. Regular rapid testing is vital to break the chain of transmission – now all adults are advised to do two tests a week. Rapid testing kits are free and you can do them at home, with results appearing within just  minutes. If you test positive, you’ll be able to isolate straightaway rather than risk spreading Covid to others. Millions of people have already made regular home testing part of their routine, as secondary school children and their parents have been able get free tests since February, but now everyone is encouraged to play their part. Every test helps to put your mind at rest and helps protect people around you as the country moves out of lockdown. Around one in three people with coronavirus has no symptoms. Rapid Covid-tests are for people who aren’t showing symptoms. If you’re showing symptoms , order a PCR test. Test twice a week, or every three or four days: it’s the best way to catch a case of Covid- at the point it becomes highly infectious.If you test positive you should self-isolate immediately and visit nhs.uk get-tested or call  to order a PCR test that will confirm the result.If you test negative, you must still follow the Hands, Face, Space and Fresh Air rules to minimise the spread of Covid-. Rapid tests are easy to use and give results within  minutes. It’s important to report your results online straightaway, whether the test is positive, negative or even void. It’s easy to do at gov.uk report-covid-result or by calling .More than m rapid tests have been taken since October , and hundreds of thousands of positive cases among people with no symptoms have been picked up. Information from the rapid tests is kept anonymous, and scientists use it to spot patterns and outbreaks more quickly and accurately, helping to reduce the risk of future lockdowns. Even though you might have already had one or two doses of vaccine, there’s a chance you could still give Covid to someone , as no vaccine is  per cent effective. So it’s vital to test twice weekly as well as continuing to follow social distancing guidance, washing hands, wearing a face covering and letting fresh air in. Rapid Covid- tests are suitableyou have no symptoms of Covid .“Remember, around a third of people with coronavirus have no symptoms, but could be spreading it to others without knowing,” says GP Dr Amir Khan. “Rapid testing is effective at detecting people who are infectious and enabling us to find Covid- cases that we otherwise would not know about. This helps us in our efforts to stop the spread of the virus. Testing regularly even when you have no symptoms means we can keep infection levels low and our country safe, and the good thing is they give a result within  minutes.” And, as Dr Khan notes, the tests are very reliableyou do them correctly. “Testing ourselves for coronavirus using rapid Covid- tests is vital in keeping ourselves and others safe from coronavirus and keeping infection rates in our communities low. When done correctly, the tests are at least . per cent specic, which means the risk of  positives is extremely low – less than one in a thousand. This means it is a very good test.”‘All I had was a mild sore throat’ Kim Tobin, from Southend, Essex, works in a supermarket and had a positive Covid- test in January  Routine rapid testing in the workplace helped Kim, , discover she had Covid, even though she was showing no symptoms. Without the test, she could have spread it to her workmates and customers.“I had a very, very mild sore throat, just a little scratch and that was it,” she says. “I didn’t even think anything of it. I was all dressed for work, ready to go. Then I went and had the test, and after  minutes the lady who had done it came up to me and said, ‘You need to go home right now because you’ve got it – you’ve tested positive.’”"},{"url":null,"title":"family reuniting after year facetime","story":"NewsopinionFamily reuniting after year of FaceTime felt better than  Christmas Days put togetherThe warm and wise words of Mrs Savage - Robbies mum.

There are certain times in le when I like to sit back, stay quiet and really drink in a moment. That came on Sunday when, after over a year of chats over a doorstep or FaceTime, I was finally reunited with both my sons, their fabulous wives and my three grandchildren. I never need to be reminded how much family means – I love the bones of all them and would take a bullet for each of them. But when worrying times and restrictions have kept us apart, being together meant more than ever. So I stole a few minutes during my eldest grandson Charlie’s th birthday lunch at the weekend to pinch myself. Aren’t we all so lucky to be here  I even appreciated the journey to the restaurant. The sights of the motorway used to bore me as I spent so long on them during Robert’s playing days. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section But since I hadn’t been on one for almost two years, I loved staring out of the spray on the windows at other cars whizzing by, road signs and wind turbines. I tried directing Jonathan but in the end he said he preferred to use the satnav as I don’t say left or right, just “this way and that way” while waving my arms around. For months I’ve pined for a restaurant meal, dreaming of a menu full of food I hadn’t bought or prepared myself and being served a surprise. The meal was delicious. I even pretended I had a dog when I asked our lovely waitress to put my pork crackling leftovers in a box to take home. I think she knew it was for me rather than an imaginary Rover because she nipped into the kitchen and filled a box to the very top for me. She could see I had trouble walking so on the way out she helped me through the kitchen as a shortcut. When I met the chef his face fell when I said: “Excuse me, I’d like to talk to you about your gravy.” But it was just to tell him it was so wonderful I hoped he’d have a bottle I could take home.

You were so lovely to me and all my family But in the end, it wouldn’t have matteredwe’d been served Spam on stale bread. We were together and that’s all that mattered. My best memories are not of the most beautul places I’ve visited or the tastiest plates I’ve polished off. They are all based on people around me and how they make me feel. Being with my family after so long gave me a warm, comforting mix of joy, wonder, extreme love and endless gratitude. It felt better than five Christmas Days put together. Laughter helps to stop sadness Throughout Charlie’s birthday celebrations, news that Robert’s French bulldog Coco was ill hung over us like a cloud. I could feel it after lunch when we went back to his house for champagne . Robert had come straight from the vet’s and I could see his eyes were down at his cheeks as he’d been crying. Charlie was so good at making sure he talked to everyone but he kept looking over at his dad because he knew he was sad. People who have never had a dog mightn’t realise they become part of the family. They have so much love to give and ask for nothing. Coco has a problem with her spine and cannot come home from the vet’s until she is strong enough to walk.  Robert’s we Sarah was doing a great job of trying to keep everyone happy but I could see poorly Coco was on all our minds. In our family we can only feel sentimental for so long before we have to laugh again. It’s our way of coping. So I sneaked off into my grandson’s room, put on a pair of dark glasses and a baseball cap then burst back into the living room and shouted, “Let’s get this party started!” Then I began rapping.I don’t think that Charlie will forgethis th.Give us a Twirl: I’m a chocoholic  I love my grandson. But I also love chocolate. So don’t think bad of me for eating Charlie’s Easter Egg. It had been in my cupboard for far too long, beckoning, winking and whispering to me. One minute I was telling my friends I didn’t want any cakes or treats because I was trying to be healthy, the next I was ripping off the paper on Charlie’s egg and eating the lot. Within minutes, one big egg and two Twirl bars disappeared. And I enjoyed it. I felt no qualms about it. Even when I had to get down on the floor to wipe up the bits of chocolate I’d stepped in, I didn’t regret a single bite. I’ve done my Duty, guys  Each day of the run-up to the Line of Duty finale felt so exciting. The BBC did a great job of building it up. I loved the idea of the nation all tuning in at the same time like the old days before smarty-pants TVs. But I was disappointed. It was like watching an FA Cup Final, when you think about it all day, get settled in for the match... and the game is boring. If there is another series, I won’t be watching. I can’t cope with all the emotions. Why Robert backs kit for kids  No wonder Robert backs the Mirror’s campaign to help fund kids’ grassroots football kits. He remembers how much it meant to him as a child and how many sacrices we made to help him have the boots and kit he always needed. Robert now runs his own youth football team, just as my late husband Colin did when he was young. I washed the team kit and helped prepare food and drinks for supporters but Colin did everything – from setting up the goal posts to being the coach, manager and ref whenever the ref didn’t turn up.Starting this Saturday: Get FREE kits for your local grassroots football team. See Saturday’s Daily Mirror for full details on how to register! Some parents behaved worse than the kids. I wasn’t there the time a mum from our own team, furious that her son was sent off, slapped Colin in the face. If anyone hit my family these days, they’d get a walking stick where the sun don’t shine. We weathered storm but the rain carries on  Colin and I used to call my mum Michael Fish because she could predict rain with astonishing accuracy. It could be the most beautul sunny day and she would say: “Rain’s on the way. I can feel it in my back.” She was never wrong.But I wonderMum’s bones would even be surprised to see such awful weather in May. Just as we’re all starting to go out, rain is keeping us in.

The walls and ceilings of the manor were covered in black mould as a result of damage to the roof which allowed water to seep in when it rained. In another, an indoor swimming pool could be seen filled with debris and grime after being left for many years. One photo from inside the manor showed an ornate-wooden led living room complete with a stunning -foot-wide stone and cast-iron fireplace. The photos were taken by urban explorer and chemical exporter Steven Bailey, , from Oxford who visited the former fish breeding farm in Oxford in January .  He described the amount of mould in the property as insane. The grand manor was abandoned in  after both of its owners sadly passed away. The property was converted into a fish breeding farm in , before being refurbished in , once again becoming a private residence.  Steven captured the photos of the once glorious home on a Canon dsr. The level of mould in this place was insane, said Steven. It was all over the wall and ceiling and furniture and was due to the fact that the roof had a huge leak in it, so water was dripping through and soaking everything. Despite this, a lot of the manor was still in a remarkably good condition. There were ornate pieces of wooden furniture in most of the rooms and pictures of the previous owners of the house and even their pets in a lot of the rooms. The most interesting find was definitely the large and grand fireplace in the living room. That would have been an amazing place to sit and relax in the past.

While some people were disappointed that they couldnapost gather outside the hospital or see the traditional photos, the couple still included well-wishers by arranging a photocall at Windsor Castle and new dad Harry gave a spontaneous interview. But there was one aspect they legally had to share with the world - Archieaposs birth certicate. The document, like all birth certicates, was a matter of public record, regardless of your royal status. It revealed for the first time where Archie was born, the Portland Hospital, and also showed an interesting detail about Meghan - her official job title. The document lists her role as Princess of the United Kingdom. It left many fans scratching their heads, wondering why it said princess when Meghanaposs official title is Duchess. While she was given the title the Duchess of Sussex by the Queen on her wedding day, she is also technically a princess, just not in her own name. She is Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Wales through her husband, Harry. The Duchess of Cambridge also listed princess under the job section part of the form on Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louisaposs birth certicates.  However there was further confusion around Archieaposs birth certicate in January when it emerged that Meghan and Harry changed it months after officially registering his birth. The couple removed Rachel Meghan from the aposmotheraposs nameapos section, leaving simple the Duchess of Sussex.Days after the changes were made, Harry and Meghan walked away from the Fab Four’s joint charity and had quit the Royal family within months.Some experts claimed it could be seen as a snub to Prince William and Kate, who have her name on George, Charlotte and Archieaposs unorm, however this was quickly rubbished by the couple.

I didnapost have any symptoms - I was on my period the whole time and wasnapost sick or nauseous at all. There was no form of a bump as such - after I ate I got more bloated than usual but there wasnapost anything to be majorly concerned about to the point where I thought I could be pregnant.

She said: The doctor said to me aposoh, weaposre going to do a pregnancy test on youapos and I was like aposright okapos and it came back positive.

He said that they had to send me for some more tests and I was on the wheelchair going to the delivery room not knowing I was going there and the porter told me thataposs where I was going and I was about to give birth. I think I was shocked and surprised more than anything - it was all a bit surreal.  The whole night was a blur and did go really quickly but at the time I just remember thinking that I just had to get the baby out. After under an hour of active labour, her baby girl Skyla was born at :am weighing lbs oz.

Sandy Star, who once worked as an aerobics instructor, has proved a huge hit with men half her age by modelling as a muscly MILF, and earns £, a month for her efforts. The -year-old has been working as a model for two years and says fans as young as her own -year-old son are ‘obsessed’ with her because she’s an older woman who loves to lt weights. There is a total obsession with being a aposmilfapos and I have been told by my fans how much they love older women, Sandy told Jam Press. When I ask why, Iaposm told itaposs because we know what we want, how we want it done and weaposre not afraid to ask Older women have a confidence about them that younger girls donapost always have, a confidence that comes with age.Before entering into the industry I also had no idea men were so submissive to strong and powerful women with a lot of muscles.Sandy was working as a personal trainer and aerobics instructor when she quit her job in , after a friend suggested she become a webcam model and show off her body online for men who like muscular women.  She gave it a try and within months was earning between £,-£,. Now Sandy regularly makes £, a month and says she is inundated with attention from ‘milf-obsessed’ men half her age. Part of her online persona - Miss Sandy - also involves her acting and dressing as a dominant. But she says she enjoys the iety of her work and being in charge when it comes to her submissive fans.  Before entering into the industry, I also had no idea men were so submissive to strong and powerful women with a lot of muscles,” Sandy, from Hertfordshire, said. A lot of men will comment on me aposnot looking apos, which is a real boost, and I am always appreciative of nice comments, there is no such thing as a bad comment - itaposs just their opinion and an opinion cannot be wrong.” Despite her own son only being , Sandy also said he was “very supportive” of her work – as is her partner Ryan, , whom is actually a former fan. We met through camming and dated last year,” Sandy explained. “As he was in a relationship, I decided I didnapost want to take it any further as this was not my style, but a short while after our dates, Ryan decided he wanted to be with me full time and we now live together.He is fully accepting of my job in every sense, supportive and encouraging every day. I couldnapost really ask for any more from him.Yes, itaposs a little alternative but when Iaposm home Iaposm me, when Iaposm working, Iaposm Sandy and thataposs it! Aside from a boob job back in  which was later revised, Sandy claims the rest of her body is all her own work. The gym-goer stays in shape by weight-lting several times a week and making sure she limits cardio. “My main focus of training has always been strength and weight training over cardio,” she explained.

He was brilliant that day and Hibs needed that wee rub of the green.“It was just unfortunate for ourselves because we were on the opposite end of it. The goalkeeper was virtually an unknown but came in and he was immense, particularly in the shoot-out at the end.“I remember having a shot from about - yards that was going in the bottom corner but, again, he got there.“I was thinking: ‘This goalkeeper’s actually better than what we’ve gave him credit for’.“That was the biggest frustration on our part.”The Hibees would go on to win it all # ending a -year wait to get their hands on the old trophy, with unorthodox Irish goalkeeper Logan the hero after saving two United penalties in the last-four shoot-out.After their  Scottish Cup Final loss to St Johnstone, for Rankin and the Terrors it was more heartache that would soon turn to misery with Premiership relegation a few short weeks later.“I had five years there and I absolutely loved it,# the former Hibs man continued.“I’m sorry it ended the way it did.#Thankfully for Ranks, though, United are back on their feet after five years in the wilderness, coming full circle as they take on Hibs as a Premiership outfit in a last-four clash at Hampden on Saturday.Recalling the build-up to that same meeting five years ago # the match ended - after extra time with the Hibees winning - on penalties # the former Tangerines midfielder is methodical.“I remember we had come from behind up at Ross County, I think we were down to nine men that day, to set up a semi-final against Hibs,# Rankin said.“I always remember coming off at County having broken two or three ribs and going to the hospital the night after thinking: ‘I need to be fit for the semi’.#I was desperate to play.“The game came around pretty quickly andMixutried something dferent – I think he had Callum Morris at left-back. | William Hill Scottish Cup\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed S-bzdCokYg featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen“The biggest surprise that day was Simon Murray not being on the bench. Those two things always stick out in my head as to why it didn’t go well.“We got an absolute doing for the first - minutes but we managed to stay in the game, Mixu made an early substitution with Callum going off and Paul Dixon coming on.“The game changed really quickly and we started to get a foothold.“When Jason Cummings took that penalty and missed it trying to chip the goalkeeper, I went round all our players and tried to fire them up because I thought it was disrespectful.“It was such a big game for both us and them. I’d played for Hibs before and I knew their history of not winning the Scottish for a long time so I know how big a moment that was.“I tried to rally the troops from then on in and, at half-time, myself and Pateswere both speaking, Mixu had a go and at that point we realised we’re in a Scottish Cup semi-final.“It was a break from the league so let’s go and try to play.“In the second half, we had a couple of opportunities through Billy Mckay and Henri Anier to try to get a goal but it went to extra time.“At that point, I can always remember Hibs had a tough schedule and they actually looked knackered.“They’d lost a League Cup Final to Ross County, were pushing in the Championship and I remember looking at Paul Hanlon and John McGinn and they looked like they had nothing left in the tank.“The longer the game went on I thought: ‘There’s only going to be one winner here’.“We looked fitter and stronger but, credit to those guys because they managed to dig out the result that day.#Relegation to the Championship, where United would remain for four years until promotion last term, signalled an end to Rankin#s time in tangerine, clocking  appearances from -.Although he looks back with fondness, Ranks admits, having come close on a few occasions, not picking up a winners medal at Tannadice is still sore.He added: “The Scottish Cup Final in  was probably the hardest one to take because the run we’d been on – Kilmarnock, St Mirren, Inverness, Rangers – they’re all top teams, even with Rangers out of the Prem at the time.“To get to the final and not win was hard.“We beat them in the first game between us that season but St Johnstone knew exactly what we were doing, our strengths and weaknesses, and we never managed to get out of second gear.“It was disappointing but, fair play, they scored just before half time and it took the wind out of our sails.“It was the quietest dressing-room I’d ever been in at half time that day.“We were looking for something, a spark, and I think Nadirhit the post, Ryan Dow hit the post, but it didn’t happen.“Everything that probably could’ve went wrong did.“I was really disappointed not to win something in my time at Tannadice.”Safe in the top flight under Micky Mellon and headed into the biggest game the club#s faced since his day, Rankin is delighted to see United #back where they belong#.And, although it won#t make up for all his near-misses in tangerine, the former favourite sees a team keen to create better memories.“When the club went down, it was a hard time,# Rankin recalled.“There was a clear out and they tried to persevere with the two or three managers that came in.“Robbiegains promotion and it’s good to see them back in the Premiership where they belong.“It’s just a case now of challenging for major honours like United did when I was there.“We played in two cup finals, lost a few semis, too. They’re always there or thereabouts and it’s good to see them challenging again.#Lawrence Shankland v Kevin Nisbet: How the Dundee United striker can re-ignite Euro  bid with Scottish Cup win over Hibs rival\" title\"#Lawrence Shankland v Kevin Nisbet: How the Dundee United striker can re-ignite Euro  bid with Scottish Cup win over Hibs rival# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lawrence-shankland-v-kevin-nisbet-how-the-dundee-united-striker-can-re-ignite-euro--bid-with-scottish-cup-win-over-hibs-rival embed # secretxTaWpegET\" data-secret\"xTaWpegET\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He continued: “I’ve seen Hibs a few times this season and they’ve been great, they’ve got pace in the wide areas.“ Boyle’s a massive threat for them and they’ve got the two strikersas well that bounce off one another.“Having seen United recently, I think they’re concentrating on the cup because they’ve got nothing to play for in the league.

already pledged money to regenerate towns and city centre.#What we need is the vision from the like of the  local plan which set the way forward for this city for generations.#We need to do something similar to ensure our level best is done to ensure we have a quality city centre.#That may mean we have to move away from so much retail space, looking at bringing households back tot he city centre, a mix of commercial and residential is what we should be looking at.#What we require is to bring everyone together here, all politicians, businesses and citizens at large in order to debate what is required and then a serious strategic plan to ensure the future of our city centre.#The  plan, a big, bound copy of which Mr Stewart was gted for his th birthday, is credited with shaping Aberdeen as

aside is the constant threat of independence. That would help the city recover from the pandemic.#If he was to do that I would be happy to work with any party who were committed to helping the city recover.#We have a city centre masterplan and we are always looking for funding to bring projects to reality.#If the Scottish Government are willing to come forward with funding I am all ears, and I look forward to that coming.#However, we have consistently been among the lowest-funded councils in Scotland which is shameful.#Mr Stewart also spoke of hopes of a clean sweep across all north-east constituencies with three seats up for grabs tomorrow.He told us: ##I hope we do have a clean sweep, Fergus Mutch is working very hard in Aberdeenshire West.#And I would like to see all of the north-east yellow.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/KFX-040321-02-06_38116158-558x372.jpg ","title":"drink driver flipped car while more than four times limit","story":"A drink-driver crashed and flipped his car onto its roof while more than four-and-a-half times the legal alcohol limit.

teacher from Moray has begun a series of hunger strikes and sit-in protests to call for urgent action to protect the planet.John Lardner, from Forres, has become increasingly concerned about climate change over the last  years.While teaching in London and Kuwait he saw first-hand the rise of emissions and pollution in major cities.In recent years, the -year-old has become active in environmental campaigns in Moray, including protesting outside Moray Council’s headquarters to call on them to reduce their own carbon footprint.Now Mr Lardner has begun a series of -hour hunger strikes through May while calling for climate change action from the UK Government to be sped up.He said: “We’ve known about climate change since at least the s and Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and other organisations have tried so many dferent types of demonstrations and actions while lobbying MPs. “But despite all those attempts the situation has become increasingly worse and more desperate.“This is about more than just surviving, it’s about avoiding death as we hasten our own death and extinction.“In a way, fasting for le seems to be appropriate because it’s that kind of action that’s neededwe bring about change.”Mr Lardner is holding -hour sit-in protests outside Moray MP Douglas Ross’ office every Friday during May while holding his hunger strikes for climate change.The former history teacher is calling on the UK Government to speed up the passage of the Climate and Ecology Bill through the House of Commons processes.The proposed legislation, which passed the first hurdle at Westminster in September last year, is being sponsored by Green MP Caroline Lucas and calls for a Citizens Assembly to be established to work with ministers to create a strategy to meet climate and ecology objectives.However, a date for the second stage of the bill’s process through parliament is yet to be set.Mr Lardner said: “This type of bill should be accelerated through parliament rather than delayed.“We’ve seen in the past that time can be found to pass bills quickly when it suits, like the Police and Crime Bill.“Covid- is obviously a very serious crisis but we are still going to be here at the end of it, climate change is much more serious.“We need to think about things in a much more long-term way instead of focusing on economic growth, there has to be a place for considering people’s wellbeing.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

programme now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine When will I receive my coronavirus vaccine The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range, as well as the percentage of that population, covered.Public Health Scotland began reporting daily statistics on vaccinations by JCVI categories in mid-March. The chart below shows the percentage of each group who have received their first and second doses. The vaccines are being provided in accordance with the priority list drawn up by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation .

everyone.”Those seven words from Aberdeen first team coach Allan Russell were aimed not just at the players who are out of contract at the end of the season, but also at the four players who have spent the second half of the campaign on loan at the club.Gary Woods is the only one of the quartet at Pittodrie who will be a free agent in the summer and manager Stephen Glass has wasted little time in making his mind up on the goalkeeper with Woods signing a pre-contract agreement to make his move to Aberdeen permanent in the summer.Woods was perhaps the easiest decision to make when it comes to the four loan players at the club and his two-year deal represents a good piece of business for both parties.The former Ross County goalkeeper was persona non grata at the Latics after his club released a statement in September stating both the goalkeeper and team-mate David Wheater were no longer part of the first team squad, but it turned ugly, quickly.The club statement continued: “Due to matters that neither party is in a position to disclose, the decision has been made to ensure the football club can now focus on the season ahead.”Woods and Wheater are represented by the same sports agency and they were quick to respond on their clients’ behalf with a strong statement of their own.It read: “When players sign a contract they are fully committed to honouring that contract with the club and be professional  per cent of the time and train and play to the best of their abilities.“Inthey expect the management of the club to also honour the contract, be paid on time and to act with a high standard of professionalism.“Unfortunately we believe that Oldham’s management, in releasing the club statement, is designed to put unfair, undue pressure on two experienced professional players to break a contract which was signed in good faith.”Former Dons boss Derek McInnes offered Woods a leline when he brought him to Aberdeen on loan in October and the deal was extended in January when Tomas Cerny, the number two at the club, was forced to retire due to injury.Wheater was not so lucky, having to wait until March before agreeing a termination of his deal with the club.But, having stepped into the breach following a rib injury to Dons captain Joe Lewis recently, Woods has taken his chance to show what he can do with some accomplished displays as of late.Undoubtedly he has taken his chance and has earned a permanent deal after showing he can be a safe pair of hands when called upon.Callum Hendry has also worked hard to make a positive impression and he has been the most productive of the three loan forwards who arrived on deadline day in February.The son of former Scotland captain Colin, Hendry fell out of the first team picture at St Johnstone in late September and arrived at Pittodrie in February with two goals to his name for Saints this season, the last of which came in a - win against Motherwell in the Betfred Cup in November.The -year-old has had to fight for his place at Pittodrie too, but of the three loan players he leads the way with three goals since his arrival from McDiarmid Park.With  months remaining on his deal with the Perth club, it is unclear whether he will have a future with the League Cup finalists, but whatever happens he can be pleased with his efforts from his time in the Granite City.Elsewhere, there is no doubting Florian Kamberi’s ability. He was involved in both goals in last week’s - win at Livingston, but remains something of an enigmatic figure and he does appear to lack the consistency to go with his talent.His goal against Livingston in the Scottish Cup win last month is his only one since moving to Pittodrie on February  and, with two years remaining on his contract with St Gallen, Dons boss Glass will have to decide whether he has done enough to earn an extended stay.With Aberdeen in need of a regular goalscorer to follow in the footsteps of Sam Cosgrove and Adam Rooney, he needs to be certain Kamberi fits the bill.Finally, there is Fraser Hornby.Injuries have prevented from showing what he is capable of during his loan from Stade de Reims.Viewed as a long-term project by his club in France, the Scotland under- international is under contract with his club until the summer of  after they paid Everton £. million for his services last summer.He has yet to get off the mark at Pittodrie and seems likely toto France in the summer.Stephen Glass did not bring any of the quartet to Pittodrie, but he will have the final say on whether any of them can be part of his future plans.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"argyll gardens bloom for 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  # one of a family of three brothers and four sisters # and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves # like so many other families # caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons # Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action  and John, , missing in action  # during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimagineable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area. It looks amazing.#[Note: Would you set the following as a piece within the overall feature please]It was while talking with a cousin about the family#s McNab heritage that Clare learned of a th century tragedy in the family.Her cousin mentioned a drowning on Loch Awe involving Donald McNab, elder brother by four years of Alexander.Parliamentary records reveal that Donald, a boatman, drowned on the morning of June  .Hansard records that Sir Charles Cameron, Liberal MP for Glasgow College, asked the Lord Advocate Mr J H A MacDonald about the incident in the House of Commons during September that year.He pointed out that Donald#s body was not found where his companions in the boat alleged he had fallen overboard and, when found floating weeks afterwards, it bore marks on the head and hand.Given those circumstances and #considering the anxiety of McNab#s family to have the case investigated#, he asked the Lord Advocate whether he would direct the procurator fiscal #to order such post mortem examination as may show whether the marks referred to had been caused before or after death or,such an examination has been made, he will allow MacNab#s family to inspect the medical report and any depositions in the case #The Lord Advocate replied that the people who were with him in the boat gave information at once to the police.He added: #The body was not recovered until August  and was, of course, in an advanced state of decomposition and had been injured from being in that state.#It was examined by a competent medical man who reported there was no sign of any injury having been inflicted before death. It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS.

Most notably, throughout the pandemic, I have been supporting constituents and businesses with COVID- related matters such as sourcing financial help and dealing with concerns over vaccinations.I have delivered real results for the Borders. I campaigned for the poundm Borderlands funding for a Bordersrsquo Railway extension feasibility study, supported the successful re-instatement of Reston station and called for a fund to fix the crumbling roads. On the rural front, I put pressure on the SNP Government for more funding for agriculture and pushed for more resources to tackle rural crime and fly-tipping.As the Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People, I worked with the Scottish Conservative strategy team, to formulate new policies to support older people and matters relating to Social Security Portfolio, such as narrowing the disability employment gap and improving digital inclusion.Looking ahead to the election I will campaign hard for local issues. When it comes to our fantastic NHS, I want a focus on reducing waiting times, improving mental health services and protecting local GP surgeries.As we emerge from the COVID pandemic, we must attract high quality, well-paid jobs to the Borders and improve infrastructure and digital connectivity to bolster the rural economy.On education, I support a national tutoring programme to help pupils catch up, more rural teachers and free school breakfasts and lunches to all primary school children.My campaign, alongside Doddie Weir OBE, continues on automatic access for people living with MND to receive a Blue Badge.

Before politics I worked in the third sector as a fundraising assistant for Marie Curie, and then for international oil company National Oilwell Varco Mission Products handling customs and logistics. I now work part time as Office Manager for a member of the Scottish Parliament and as a Communications Manager for an MP. I decided to stand in the General Election in  in Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk because I was tired of the constitutional wrangling and wanted to bring the focus back to making a dference locally and further afield. Now, we need to put recovery from the pandemic first. From supporting tourism and local business to tackling the climate emergency, delivering a better education system, supporting the NHS, bettering mental health provision, and making the case for a truly federal UK, I will always stand up for the disadvantaged and will make fairness and tackling inequality central to everything I want to achieve. I want to remove the barriers to opportunity which face rural areas more than others. Everyone should have the chance of living the le they want and to be as successful as possible. During the last year the curtains have been pulled back on where the help is most needed and we need to have a needle sharp focus on getting help to all those in that position. Ultimately, I want to tackle to the root of inequality which is poverty, and keep the climate crisis at the top of everyonersquos agenda. We know our country is wracked by constitutional ision and inequality so now our representatives need to focus on healing and serving communities to the best of their ability at a time when it has never mattered more.

Indeed, I spent years at an Edinburgh healthcare technology company, collaborating with universities and NHS Scotland on articial intelligence software for cancer screening and diagnosis of stroke.Throughout this pandemic we have seen the power of our countryrsquos science base. Despite bumps in the road, the roll-out of testing and multiple vaccines has been impressive.But the pandemic tells another story too ndash of warnings ignored and preparations left unmade. We could and should have had a better plan for one of the highest-ranked known public health risks. We must learn from this collective failure.Scientists have warned for decades that the world is heading towards climate breakdown. They also now speak of a ldquonature emergency ndash an era of mass extinctions caused by humans. Yet greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere relentlessly rise and our forests and oceans continue in dangerous decline. Nowadays, I see scientists practically weeping as they watch this unravelling accelerate, with no believable action plan from politicians.The Scottish Greens recognise that technology will play a huge part in stepping us back from the brink. Our co-leader Lorna Slater is a renewable energy engineer, and our proposed poundbn Green Recovery investment programme will fund thousands of high-quality, unionised Scottish jobs in renewables. But letrsquos not kid ourselves. Itrsquos mostly not technology we lack, itrsquos political will.The Greens will invest massively in warm homes ndash upgrading insulation and converting to low-carbon heating systems. We have bold plans to improve rail, bus and active travel, and already won free bus travel for under-s from this summer. Finally, we propose an urgent programme to repair nature, dramatically accelerating the positive steps already taken by rural businesses, workers and charities.These solutions are not high-tech, not ldquosexy and may not generate huge profits for international investors and a rich elite. But theyrsquore effective, labour-intensive, local, and fair.This election is our chance to tackle the climate emergency, to build a green recovery, and to secure our future as an independent European country.

He has lived in the Scottish Borders for  years.Vanguard Party champions the Union and Brexit. The UK, four nations in union, will prosper as an independent country, outwith the EU. If Scotland were to leave the Union and join the EU, it would not be an independent country. It would be a rule-taker from Brussels. There would be a hard border with the rest of the UK. Scottish exports to the rest of the UK are currently worth three times those to the EU. Funding via the Barnett formula would end. Scots would lose British citizenship.Vanguard Party believes Scotlands future should be decided by the people, not the courts. However, independence is not practical without the support of a simple majorityof the registered electorate, not merely a simple majority of valid votes. IndyRef must require a simple majority of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland, for the whole of Scotland to leave. In  only  per cent of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland voted for independence.Vanguard Party will preserve the distinction between sex and gender. It will protect womens rights to same-sex spaces. It will oppose self-identication. It will oppose any denial of biological truth.Vanguard Party will champion children of disadvantaged backgrounds by providing help and support to raise attainment. It will not promote quotas and targets that may excuse lower attainment.Vanguard Party will champion the NHS. It will recognise the true worth of all NHS staff. It will tackle hospital waiting lists and support GPs to resume face-to-face appointments for all.Vanguard Party will abolish hate crime including incitement of hatred in peoples minds. It will require crimes to be based on evidence, tested objectively, not on subjective perceptions of victims or others.Vanguard Party will champion traditional values and culture. It will take back control of British institutions and push back against the tyranny of woke.*Please note: Michael Banks of the Vanguard Party did not supply a photograph to this newspaperChristine Grahame Christine Grahame, Scottish National PartyI am privileged to be a member of the Scottish Parliament since , representing the constituency for ten years. Most important was keeping in touch with you through my surgeries: in supermarkets, libraries, and my annual summer surgery tour through the villages. This past year of course has changed everything. We have all been stuck at home keeping in touch through emails. COVID has dominated and I have tried to help you with the problems it brought in its wake. Moving now through vaccination, queries arise as you await that appointment. At the same time other issues continue: unsuitable housing, planning concerns. This is the essential work and duty of an MSP to constituents no matter what their politics. I hope I have discharged that duty. I have also chaired the parliamentrsquos cross-party group on animal welfare for many years with two Bills to my name: The Control of DogsAct , now law, putting the blame on the owner not the dog and The Welfare of DogsBill which aims to end casual purchase of puppies. COVID prevented it proceeding butelected I intend to bring it back, especially with concern that some of those \"COVID\" puppies will end up in animal rescue centres. Yes, how le has changed, COVID has been hard: losing a business built over years, living with children trapped in a flat, not attending a funeral, delaying the wedding, the new baby not socialising with family. The list is endless of the sacrices, the losses. COVID has broken the link with the way we were, just as those World Wars changed society. Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated true leadership and moving to recovery it must not be back to the same old, same old but to a socially just society, valuing people from cradle to grave, our public services, rejoining the EU as an independent nation. On May , I ask for your constituency vote on my record as your MSP and the list vote for the SNP, giving you and Scotland a democratic choice to move forward as a renewed nation.Shona Haslam Shona Haslam, Scottish ConservativesOn Thursday, May , voters are faced with a choice. Rebuild our communities after the pandemic by improving our childrenrsquos education, delivering record funding to our NHS and enhancing employment opportunities, or, once again, reopen the question of Scotlandrsquos place within the United Kingdom.Make no mistake: the next few weeks will see one of the most important elections of our letime.Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated recently that she only cares about one thing, an independence referendum that most Scots do not want but one that she will still foist upon them anyway. The past year has been tough for us all. Many of us have struggled with the pressures of lockdown, myself included. But the way to recover from this pandemic is not to launch into another constitutional argument that threatens our livelihoods, our childrenrsquos futures and our way of le.As a mum to two lovely boys, I want to see a government that puts aside its own agenda and commits to focusing on whatrsquos best for the next generation of Scots. ldquoJudge me on my record said Nicola Sturgeon on education. Well, the attainment gap remains as large as it ever was, and Scotlandrsquos education system has plummeted in international rankings. It would seem the First Minister has been found wanting.Itrsquos not just our schools that under threat other public services are too. As leader of the Scottish Borders Council, I have fought tirelessly against repeated cuts to our budget, forcing councillors to make dficult choices simply because the Scottish Government finds it easier to pass the buck. After the strain of COVID, we need a Scottish Government that will step up, empower councils and work with them, not against them.Butthe SNP gain enough seats to form a majority in May then all that is at risk. Once again, they will push for another isive referendum.There is only one way to stop that: lend me your constituency vote, and the Scottish Conservatives your party vote, on May .ACMay AC May, Scottish Liberal DemocratsI intend to represent you the only way I know how - by working tirelessly with a keen eye on the future to ensure that there is investment and improvement in education, employment opportunities and business growth. I will stand up for better funded healthcare and demand that money is directed towards care homes, mental health and wellbeing to bring these up to the standards we all deserve. To do this will need a strong economy and the Scottish Liberal Democrats are putting recovery first ndash this must be Scotlandrsquos priority. A vote for me is a vote of confidence for a more secure future for you and your families.Its time for a change. The area needs someone who will heed the concerns of constituents, and voice these strongly in parliament, not just another person sitting in Holyrood applauding every word of the First Minister.Prior to the boundary changes, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had a long record of success here, and its high-time for ato rational, clear thinking on the issues that matter locally and nationally.Our high streets and town centres ndash the beating heart of our communities ndash need urgent help. This was apparent before the pandemic, but even more so now. Online commerce can bring tremendous benefits and is here to stay. Many businesses have transformed to the new normal, but many others have struggled. We need to focus on how growing online spend can coexist with a vibrant local economy, and work to restore community feeling.Im looking forward to getting stuck into the campaign. By their own admission, a ided Tory party has mishandled Brexit, driving Scottish voters in desperation towards nationalism, while the opportunist and populist SNP seeks to compound the disaster of Brexit by withdrawing from the UK completely, just at the point when we need economic recovery the most.A vote for me is a vote for progress through strong partnerships within Scotland, across the UK and with our European neighbours, so that together we can recover from the COVID crisis and move beyond the politics of ision.Katherine Sangster Katherine Sangster, Scottish LabourCOVID-rsquos impact on our families, our communities and our economy has been profound. We now need to start the hard work of rebuilding our country and that task needs new faces, fresh ideas and experience outside of Holyrood.I am a working parent who prior to  had never been involved in politics. However, I like many other parents soon realised that the SNPrsquos childcare policies sound good on the back of an election leaflet but donrsquot work in practice. So, in , I campaigned for fairer access to childcare and led Fair Funding for our Kids - a nationwide campaign that got childcare on to the national agenda, building a movement of mums that demanded action from Government. Our campaign secured more funded childcare from Government - a step towards equality, but there is still plenty to be done.Soon, I was speaking on television, writing for newspapers and lobbying politicians. All things I has never done before but I was speaking from the heart and articulating mine and othersrsquo experience. Now with five years plus experience in politics I still firmly believe that policy is best made by those with lived experience and the job of a politician is to listen and advocate on peoples behalf, and I will always put that at the heart of what I do.Working for an MP now, every day I support people with the issues that blight their lives from poor housing to an inhumane benefits system to bins not getting picked up. These are issues that affect people day in day out. Chatting to voters and speaking to constituents, I have experienced no appetite for debate on a second referendum just a desire from people that we as politicians and aspiring politicians listen to their concerns and respond to those concerns.We need to elect MSPs to Holyrood who understand these concerns and will fully use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to make peoplersquos lives better. Holyrood is one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world lets start using those powers. As Donald Dewar said at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in  ldquoA Scottish Parliament, not an end but a means to greater ends.On May  please use your vote carefully and letrsquos start the task of uniting our country behind our national recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-bank-holiday-offers-big-mac-mcchicken-sandwich","story":"Have you enjoyedthe Bank Holiday weekend a bit too

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area. It looks amazing.#If you have any other information on this branch of the McNab family, please email editor@campbeltowncourier and this will be passed on to Clare."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 30 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"liveargylls leisure facilities and libraries reopen","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"former-ross-high-pupil-ruari-paton-aiming-scottish-cup-glory","story":"Ruari Paton will be hoping to line up for Stranraer todaywhen they make the long journey north to face Brora Rangers, who stunned Hearts in the previous round.The frontman attended the Tranent secondary school after signing for Hibernian as a teenager and making the move from Dublin.Many had expected Stranraer to be travelling to Tynecastle this weekend but Brora caused one of the biggest shocks in the competitionrsquos history when they won - last Tuesday.Paton was part of the Stranraer team taking on Brechin City at the same time and said that his reaction was much the same as football fans up and down the country when he heard the result.He said: ldquoI would not like to take anything away from Brora but you donrsquot really hear of a Championship team getting beaten by a Highland League or a Lowland League team ever.ldquoIt was a shock, it was a big shock, but fair play to them.ldquoWhat an achievement it is and it is an amazing challenge to overcome.ldquoYou cannot take anything away from them.Stranraer have enjoyed an impressive start to the campaign, with just one defeat since the beginning of November, as they look toto League One.Paton, who now lives in Bothwell, South Lanarkshire, has been at the heart of that form, scoring eight goals in all competitions, with strikes against Spartans and a last-minute penalty winner against Kelty Hearts in the previous round.He has also found the net for Gala Fairydean Rovers, while on loan from Hibs, and for East Kilbride in the competition last year.Now, attention has turned to the trip to Brora and Paton said: ldquoTherersquos nothing better in the world than scoring. Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends.

It seems very unfair that we should no longer be able to use a road that we pay for to access the hills.I noticed a picture on Facebook, taken on a sunny Sunday when people would normally be out enjoying a walk around the reservoir, but only one car seems to be using the car park.As East Lothian grows, we should be utilising as much of our outdoor space as possible to help our population exercise and take pressure off coastlines and popular woodland areas. The Lammermuir Hills are underused for recreation and have a superb network of paths, but woefully inadequate parking.Overriding everything in the letter you printed is the Scottish Governments Land Reform Act of , which clearly states the Right for Responsible Access in Scotland.. The overall framework of land rights, responsibilities and public policies should promote, fulfil and respect relevant human rights in relation to land, contribute to public interest and wellbeing, and balance public and private interests. The framework should support sustainable economic development, protect and enhance the environment, help achieve social justice and build a fairer society.. There should be a more erse pattern of land ownership and tenure, with more opportunities for citizens to own, lease and have access to land.The landownerrsquos decision to heavily restrict parking prejudices families, those with disabilities and groups who take people walking in the hills and need an access point. I understand that during the last year, the countryside has suffered littering, fires and irresponsible parking, but to punish responsible visitors because of the behaviour of a minority is a knee-jerk reaction and will only create animosity towards the estate at a time when public opinion is turning against grouse shooting. Instead, the landowner should be working with local residents, East Lothian Council and interested parties to help improve access and educate visitors on how to visit responsibly.Name and address supplied"},{"url":null,"title":"builders-merchant-built-instead-hotel-former-raceland-site","story":"The former Raceland karting site, between Gladsmuir and Longniddry, closed in early .Work is due to start later this year on a petrol station, two drive-thru restaurants and a drive-thru cafe on the southern section of the site.Initial proposals suggested a hotel could be built on the northern part of the former karting site, where the outdoor track was located, but that could now be ditched for a buildersrsquo merchants.The karting centre was given planning permission in  and also operated a paintball centre.

According to the Electoral Management Board for Scotland,  constituencies will wrap up voting and declare results by the end of Friday.Votes for the remaining  constituencies will be counted on Saturday, May , however, regional results wonrsquot be calculated and declared until the last constituency in each region has concluded counting."},{"url":null,"title":"crystal-rig-iv-200-metre-wind-turbines-red-aviation-lights-built-lammermuirs","story":"The new turbines in theLammermuir Hills sparked concern from East Lothian Council after they included plans to put red aviation lights at the top.The local authority argued they would be as visible as the giant cranes at the St James Centre in Edinburgh city centre were across the county.And other objectors likened the towering turbines to ldquothe towers of the new Queensferry crossing.Even the Ministry of Defence raised concerns they would interfere with operations.However, in a report approved by Scottish Ministers following an appeal by windfarm operators Fred. Olsen Renewables, their Reporters ruled none of the objections were strong enough to support refusing planning permission for the turbines.The operators had argued that the case for renewable energy outweighed concerns over the giant turbines.They said: ldquoThe need case for renewable energy development is greater than ever before. Consequently, it would take a local impact of overwhelming importance to justy a refusal of consent, and there is none.East Lothian Council objected to plans to extend the Crystal Rig windfarm project, which straddles its border with the Scottish Borders, over plans to put red lights on top of them to meet CivilAviation Authority regulations.They said: ldquoThe Lammermuirs form the backdrop to East Lothian. The skyline, especially where unbroken, characterises East Lothian.ldquoThe area is characterised by a lack of lighting, creating the perception of an undeveloped area at night.Objecting to the need to put aviation lights on the new turbines because of their height, the council said: ldquoA good example for red lighting when views from East Lothian are the lights on the cranes at the St James Centre. These show how clearly red light travels and that the intensity of the light and weather conditions makes little dference to the distance it can be viewed at. The lighting here is easily visible from the Garleton Hills, a similar distance as the proposed Crystal Rig turbines are from Tranent.Representatives from Mayshiel and Cranshaws Estates also lodged objections, saying the inclusion of -metre-high turbines in the latest plans should be very carefully considered.Comparing them to the height of the Queensferry Crossing towers, they said: ldquoIt is a stalking horse prelude to the proposed re-powering of the early phases of Crystal Rig with turbines of this height.The proposals for Crystal Rig IV will see a further  wind turbines placed in the Lammermuir Hills.The latest phase of the Crystal Rig project will take the number of turbines on the site to more than .The Reporters said of the lighting concerns: ldquoWe find that very few people would be affected by visibility of the lights to a signicant degree, including those living in the small number of residential properties located within, or just beyond, three kilometres of the application site.And they dismissed claims by East Lothian Council that ldquoa memory of a familiar view should be taken into account in an assessment of landscape impact.They concluded: ldquoWe are satisfied that the applicant has had regard to the potential signicant effects of the proposed development.ldquoWe have considered the responses and found no grounds on which to disagree with [the applicantsrsquo] assessments of the application.Scottish Ministers issued consent for the turbines."},{"url":null,"title":"polling-station-scottish-election-2021-details-explained","story":"The scale of ldquoSuper Thursday means that every voter in Great Britain will be able to take part in at least one type of poll, making it the biggest event of its kind outside a general election.How does the voting system work Scots will elect  MSPs, the outcome of which will give an indication of the level of support for the SNPrsquos push for a fresh referendum on independence.People will cast two ballots under the additional member system ndash a form of proportional representation ndash electing both constituency and regional MSPs.Votes for the inidual candidates in the  constituencies are counted first.The  regional MSPs ndash split across eight regions ndash are elected using a formula aimed at ensuring that the number of seats a party gets in total across a region is about the same as the percentage of votes it receives.And with more than . million people registered to vote in the upcoming Holyrood election, voters are now being encouraged to make sure theyre ready to vote on  May.The final total of voters registered for the Scottish Parliament election has been confirmed at ,, ndash the highest electorate ever for a Scottish Parliament election.You can find out where your local polling stationis by checking with your local council or by entering your postcodehere.Polling stations are open from am to pm onThursday May , .You must vote at your assigned polling station, however you dont need your poll card to vote.If you are registered to vote, but you dont have your poll card, you can go to the polling station and give them your name and address.In England, Wales and Scotland, you dont need any form of ID.However, in Northern Ireland, you must bring photo ID.Local election teams located at polling stations across the country will be doing everything they can to ensure polling stations aresafe for everyone.Certain safety measures will be in place in order to prevent the spread of Covid-, including the following:"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-second-substation-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-lodged-council","story":"The latest planning application, from Seagreen Wind Energy, shows a substation built on top of a former gasholder site stretching across paths which the firm admits may have to be erted.Seagreen sparked local concern when its initial consultation appeared to put the entire Greenhills in its proposed site.However, the plans now lodged with the council show the substation across the road from the former Cockenzie Power Stationrsquos main footprint on an old gasworks area now being used for a temporary car wash business.Acknowledging concerns raised by community councils over the loss of green space, Seagreenrsquos application says: ldquoAs far as possible, the proposed substationwill be sited to avoid any areas of habitat value.

meant votes will be tallied from Friday.This yearrsquos election, while conducted under the constraints of coronavirus rules, is also considered to be one of the most important since the Scottish Parliament opened in .With the SNP set for another five years in government, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt ramp up the pressure on Westminster to grant the powers for another vote on Scottish independence.Her opponents in the Tory, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties have stressed the importance of focusing on Scotlandrsquos recovery from coronavirus insteadBut the SNP leader and her party have said no referendum will be held until after the immediate health crisis is over, and they insist powers gained through independence would actually improve the recovery in Scotland.Ms Sturgeon has said another pro-independence majority in the Scottish Parliament, including the Greens and Alba Party seats, should be enough to let Scots vote again on whether they want to leave the UK.Take a look at the potential declaration times here:"},{"url":null,"title":"burgh-primary-school-pupils-images-make-people-smile-bid-raise-money-playground-improvements","story":"Pupils from

They feast on birdseed in trays, play acrobatics to jump on fat ball feeders and make light work of scaling metal poles to steal the peanuts from my bird feeders.So, is there really a squirrel-proof feeder which works Matthew Tume, RSPB product manager of birdcare and optics, says that in reality, no product on the market is totally squirrel-proof.\"Squirrels are very intelligent and very determined, and they will find ways around things.\"However, Rachel Schofield, of birdfood and wildle product specialist CJ Wildle, says: \"Theres a great number of really good squirrel-proof feeders on the market, as far as adult squirrels are concerned. Juveniles, however, can squeeze through protective cages.\"What material should you go for \"Metal and preferably powder-coated. Plastic feeders wont last very long. You can buy protective cages for many feeders, but its cheaper to buy an integrated unit,\" says Schofield.\"Squirrels can chew through plastic ports, so we would recommend you use metal feeders, rather than plastic ones,\" Tume agrees.What about birdseed Youre best off with a no waste seed mix, says Schofield, which will help deter pigeons and squirrels from picking up the discarded husks which smaller birds deposit on to the ground. You can buy huskless seeds and sunflower hearts.\"De-husked ieties will be more expensive, but you get what you pay for. Reputable companies which sell good quality seed mixes wont pack them full of wheat or maize. And using de-husked ieties means that birds dont lose time trying to get to the nutrients,\" says Schofield.Where should I put the feeders \"Set them away from jumping-off points, such as fences and hanging trees. However, there is a balance. You want your feeders to have a degree of cover, as the further out in the open they are, the easier it is for predators - such as birds of prey - to spot them,\" says Tume.Are there any other ways to deter squirrels Some people suggest dusting the birdseed with chilli powder or hot sauce like Tabasco, which apparently doesnt bother the birds, but the squirrels dont like the spice, says Tume.Others recommend smearing your bird feeder poles with Vaseline to stop the squirrels climbing up them.Or, you could always try putting up a squirrel feeder at the other end of the garden, away from your bird station, and give visiting squirrels some peanuts of their own.On test: Which squirrel deterrents should I consider Feeder s\"There are feeder s, which are effectively cages which go around your feeders. You hang your feeders inside the cage. The idea is that the cage holes are big enough for small birds to enter and exit safely, and small enough to act as a deterrent for squirrels. They make it more dficult for squirrels to access, but juveniles will be able to squeeze through,\" says Tume.\"Smaller birds - such as blue tits, goldfinches and greenfinches - will be able to fly in and out of the cages, but larger birds - such as jackdaws and magpies - may be deterred, although magpies have long necks, so may be able to reach through to get the seed, depending on the gap between the cage wall and the feeder.\"They should be made to the exact specication which allows small birds in safely, but also deters adult squirrels and large birds,\" he adds.Tried  Tested: The Squirrel  Port Adventurer withThis was the only item which really stopped the squirrel in its tracks. It managed to jump on to the top of the feeder from a tall shrub but was too big to get through the metal guard. It even tried to open the lid of the tubular feeder, but couldnt get in.Squirrel bafflesThese are plastic domes which fit either over the bird feeder, or half way up the poleyou are securing the feeder from the ground, but under the feeding stations. They aim to prevent squirrels from descending on to or climbing up to the feeders.\"If they manage to climb on to the baffle, the baffle often rocks the squirrels loose, so they fall off,\" says Tume. \"We get mixed feedback on them.\"Tried  Tested: The Squirrel Guard Baffle This cone did stop the squirrels from climbing up to reach the feeder, but one managed to get on to the feeder from above, and then accessed the food. However, once Id moved the pole away from tall shrubs and trees from which it could gain access, the baffle worked very well.The weighted feederSquirrel Buster feeders are weighted devices which shut off access to the feeding points when a squirrel or heavy pigeon lands on them, via a metal shutter. These are widely available and one of the most popular deterrents.Tried  Tested: The Squirrel Buster Peanut Birdfeeder I made the mistake of hanging this weighted feeder from a bracket on my garden fencepost, which enabled the squirrel to access the peanuts by taking its weight on its back legs on the fence and then gently placing its front paws on the feeder.It didnt manage to get much food though, as the feeder bobbed up and down as its weight distribution changed. Place the feeder in a clear space with no other balancing points nearby, and it will be much more effective."},{"url":null,"title":"hannah-simone-for-sake-comedy-pit-women-other","story":"Overflowing with charmingly relatable, and, at times, utterly bizarre story arcs, US sitcom New Girl was quick to capture the hearts of viewers on both sides of the Atlantic.It is, in essence, the ultimate embodiment of le during your late s and early s.Encapsulating the day-to-day escapades of four equally quirky characters living under one roof, the show quickly achieved cult status, running for a grand total of  episodes before finally drawing to an end in .Now, as the show prepares to mark its th anniversary, Disney has announced that New Girl will be available to a whole new audience when it arrives on Star on the Disney+ streaming service this April.\"I mean, I would be up for it.

Thats not what would happenyou found out your girlfriend moved in with three men off the internet.\"And I feel like she managed to stay true to female friendships, and showed how funny it is.\"The on and off-screen dynamics\"I do think one of the things that I genuinely love is that Lamorne and I are such close friends,\" reflects Simone.\"We shared a trailer for the entire time that we shot the show - there was a wall in between, dont worry, but you know, we had a double trailer. So our friendship was really close.\"And then when the writers and the creators of the show genuinely saw how close Lamorne and I were, they then started to write it into the show, which is why Winston and Cece became this kind of like very odd but wonderful duo.\"Its a friendship that translated seamlessly onto our screens, including the finer details such as the pairs synchronised finger clicks.\"I remember Lamorne and I on set doing this kind of like, snap, snap thing that kind of moment when we agreed on something.\"And then it made it into the show.\"And it was just a wonderful, genuinely funny moment for me that my weird little friendship that I have in real le with Lamorne had become such a huge part of the show and something that people really liked.\"So I love that I love that people really dig Winston and Cece and their mess arounds.\"The shows lasting legacyComprising of seven series and making up over a hundred hours worth of viewing time, New Girls legacy will continue to live on - both on our screens and as memories for the actors themselves.\"It was almost a decade of my le,\" notes Simone of the shows run.\"Its a huge part of who I am personally now... We all kind of grew up together on that show, in a way.\"And professionally, it was a show where I felt I never had to do anything I wasnt really excited about - and thats so rare.\"With the majority of the show filmed solely within the four walls of the characters apartment, the shows set was bound to harbour memories, as Simone can attest.\"One of my favourite moments of the show is that last moment of us standing in the empty loft all squeezed onto a box that I think they intentionally made about three sizes too small,\" laughs Simone nostalgically.\"Maybe three people could have stood semi-comfortably on it, but there were five of us, so we were literally holding on to each other for dear le so nobody fell off this big box.\"And that was a really special moment.\"Weve never seen the loft empty before, so it was genuinely emotional on so many levels.\"Its such a fond period of my le to look back on.\"New Girl is available to stream on Star on Disney+ from Friday"},{"url":null,"title":"elections-2021-likely-declaration-times-across-scotland-england-wales","story":"Millions of people across the country took to the polls - for the Scottish Parliamentary elections, Welsh Parliamentary elections and Englands Mayor and Council votes.Here is a guide to the likely declaration times of the results.All timings are based on the latest available information and are subject to change.ndash From am: First results likely from the  councils in England counting overnight.ndash am to am: Hartlepool by-election result expected.ndash By am: Doncaster mayoral result.ndash From around am: Counting begins in all seats for the Welsh Parliament, seven of the  constituencies for the London Assembly,  of the  constituencies for the Scottish Parliament,  councils in England, three of the  elections for police and crime commissioners, and the election for Liverpool mayor.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start.

It was the first book he purchased after escaping slavery. He was none other than the abolitionist leader and social reformer Frederick Douglass, who passed on the treasure to his son, Lewis, in .From the moment he turned its pages, Frederick Douglass cultivated not only an admiration for Burns, but for the writings of Sir Walter Scott, and a le-long affection for Scotland and the Scottish people.Douglass at his desk at  Gilmore Street in Edinburgh composing persuasive letters and formidable lectures as an anti-slavery activist was only eight years removed from escaping his own trauma of slavery in Maryland in . He must have pondered this as he walked Princes Street or surveyed the city from Calton Hill.:Derided, bullied, but triumphant: the Scottish heroine who planted the seeds of freedomDouglas was in the remarkable position of advocating internationally for human liberty so soon after his own bondage. This rapid rise to prominence was a testament to his talents, but also to the shting moral consciousness of the throngs of people he addressed.He once wrote of Edinburgh: ldquoI enjoy everything here which may be enjoyed by those of a paler hue ndash no distinction here. I have found myself in the society of thehellipfirst people of this city and no one seemed alarmed by my presence.Douglass had initially come to Scotland as part of a tour to Britain and Ireland between  and  and again in  and . His specic engagement with Scotland was to speak out against the Free Church of Scotland which had financed itself through funds that came from slaveholders in the United States.He spoke widely across Scotland, filling up chapels and assembly halls beyond capacity. He first arrived in Glasgow in . Many of his speeches and public appearance in Glasgow were delivered at City Halls in Candleriggs. Audiences and communities responded to his Send Back The Money campaign with fervent support.The story of Douglass in Scotland links to a person he called, \"the single most important influence on his le.\" That personrsquos name was Dr James McCune Smith. A fellow American and former slave, Smith was an extraordinary figure and pioneer.:David Pratt: Indias Covid tragedy shows a tale of two pandemicsHe had been blocked from further education in the United States because he was an African-American. He turned to Scotland and the University of Glasgow which made the bold decision to admit him in the early s. Smith went onto to earn a bachelorrsquos degree, a masterrsquos degree, and his medical doctorate from the University of Glasgow. He was the first African-American to receive a medical degree, and it was from a Scottish university.There is no question that as Douglass embraced Scotland, he was influenced by his close friendrsquos example. To their great credit, the University of Glasgow has named a new pound million facility the James McCune Smith Learning Hub.Douglassrsquo first visit to Scotland ended with a moving stop in Hawick in the Borders. A reporter wrote that Douglass ldquospoke for nearly two hours, in a calm, cool, dignied, and impressive manner, that shewed him to be qualied above most men to command the attention of an audience. He was enthusiastically praised by the spectators, and then with fond farewells departed for northern England. The first Scottish tour of Douglass was monumental in terms of the scale of people he educated, touched and motivated.The spirit of Douglassrsquo legacy is still intact, but as with all historical figures who advocated for progressive social change, their tones and path prints can fade unless we download their voices, trace their footsteps, and disinter their ideas from the clutch of distant history.:Uzma Mir: Why cant Scots, in Scotland, use Scots words, without being called jakeys Douglass would have been inspired by todayrsquos Black Lives Matter movement, in fact, he was a courageous catalyst of it. In Scotland, he would have eagerly supported the Black Lives Matter Scottish Mural Trail developed by Wezi Mhura and artists from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, living in Scotland.The trail is a reminder that the work of Douglass for global unity and racial equality is still an unfolding journey around the world. It is a winding road stridden by valiant feet fractured by the trying passage to greater equality.

Big political campaigns always are. Because during them broadcasters are forced out in to communities, pushing microphones and cameras under our noses and asking us to talk. And talk we do. In our own voices, and sometimes, our own dialects and languages. The result ndash as we hear from Argyll fishermen, Polish migrants, Mearns farmers, Edinburgh bankers or Lanarkshire call centre workers ndash is a chorus of erse, wonderful accents.And not just in English. This campaign, for the first time, has seen all foreign nationals living in Scotland getting the vote. That has quietly inspired a linguistic revolution. Candidates are asking people to vote for them in other languages.Aside from Mr Giuglianorsquos Italian video, SNP politicians alone have prepared clips in German, French, Spanish and Chinese. Closer to home, the Tories ndash some of whose more chauvinistic base can be hostile to indigenous languages ndash have made a party political broadcast in Gaelic.Accents: sometimes they reflect who we are, where we have been sometimes they signpost who we want to be where we want to go. But they always say as much about us as our words, whether we like it or not. They map us, vocally.They can also provoke surprisingly strong emotional responses, both positive and negative. Some of us struggle to hide our prejudice when we hear the cut-glass RP of Tory frontbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg or the working-class Glaswegian of SNP MP Mhairi Black. Both have been abused over how they speak. Polar opposites politically, they have, it is said, found common ground on this prejudice.Toni GiuglianoPoliticians, even the less able ones, are usually too savvy to indulge in what socio-linguists call ldquoaccentismrsquo, bigotry based on speech. There is not much to be gained, after all, by insulting voters, unless you are aiming for a very small demographic.The last weekend of this yearrsquos campaign, however, featured exactly this kind of election clanger. George Galloway, a Kremlin TV host and de-facto leader of a fringe British nationalist electoral slate, took to Twitter to askthe mission of BBC Scotland was to ldquomake us look and sound like a nation of Janey Godley and Rab C Nesbits before adding the he was ldquowatching jakeys.Ms Godley is a writer, comedian and an online columnist for The Herald. She has been subjected to sustained online harassment for several years, often from political unionists, some of whom now support Mr Galloway.She speaks English with a pretty routine Glasgow accent and occasionally drts in to a broader Scots. She was eloquent enough to fight her own corner, mocking the hapless, gaffe-prone Mr Galloway. He responded by publishing faked tweets ly accusing Ms Godley of being a racist. He had to apologise. There was only one loser in this Twitter spat.:Stuart Waiton: Scots university suspends lecturer as sop to woke warriorsThe ugly little episode was hardly illuminating for those who follow politics. But for socio-linguists, like Rob Drummond of Manchester politan University, it was ldquofascinating.ldquoGeorge Galloway is embodying some well-worn stereotypes regarding the relationship between accent, identity, social class, and even character, the academic said. ldquoItrsquos an unusual stance to take during elections, as surely it simply serves to alienate signicant sections of the population.ldquoHe is explicitly putting some accents on a higher-status-level than others, and seems to be accusing BBC Scotland of knowingly using this hierarchy to undermine the perception of Scotland from outside. He clearly sees one accent as representing the underclass, and another accent as representing the elite.Politicians may not often punch down. But they sometimes, Mr Drummond says, punch up, referring to ldquoposh\" Etonians. ldquoThis is, of course, still an example of accent prejudice, but arguably it is happening in the direction where the imbalance of power makes it less recognisable as such, he says.He and his colleagues have been cataloguing examples of accentism, as the BBC and other TV and radio channels widen the range of speech they broadcast.They have good news. ldquoThere is still a long way to go, but there are perhaps signs that things are changing, Mr Drummond explains. ldquoThere are suggestions that younger people do not hold the same stereotypes and attitudes towards particular accents as older people. And there is clearly a lot more ersity within broadcasting as a whole than there was  or  years ago. Also, there is simply so much more voice media around than there was [more TV, podcasts, social media, youtube etc]. Hopefully, all this exposure will have an effect.This was a TikTok election, a campaign when soundbites were not just for the evening TV news, and when everybody could have their say ndash out loud, recorded for posterity.There are still those who struggle with linguistic ersity, who think more iety makes less sense, who yearn for the certainty of a prestige dialect or accent, whether it is RP or standard Scottish English . But standardisation means less understanding, not more. It loses us so much nuance, so much identity so much poetry of place. Only speaking SSE or RP is like only painting in monochrome. Itrsquos dull.Later today we will find out who voters in Dumbarton have chosen as their voice, Mr Giugliano or Ms Baillie. Either way it will be somebody whose speech tells a story.

Most local authorities provide a bin for residents to put their food and garden waste in, for weekly or fortnightly collection and recycling, many miles from the point of collection. However, for anyone with a garden or allotment there is a much simpler, easier, and cheaper solution Using pallets or other waste wood, why not construct a home-composting system  Nearly all food waste, with the possible exception of meat and fish, can be put in your bin add grass cuttings, cardboard , shredded paper, annual weeds, some seaweed, and horse or cow manure. When full, turn into an empty bin and start filling the first one again. By the end of a summer you will have a large bin full of nourishment for your garden for next year.

I’ve only seen maybe four at the very most in the fields.Meanwhile, prices of cattle and sheep have been very good, despite of the dficult operating conditions brought by COVID restrictions.“They’re sky-high,” said Grahame, “we’re just hoping they stay there!”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

When you think of Portrush, you think of Barry’s.“It would be sadwe lost it, and there’s no doubt that everyone is saying the same thing.“It would be a massive loss to the area. People would still come to Portrush, of course, but the place wouldn’t be the same without Barry’s.”Independent councillor Angela Mulholland, who lives in nearby Portstewart, also said she would like any new buyer to keep the site as it is.“There are already enough apartments and holiday homes in the coastal area without a developer coming along and building more,” she said.“It’s a big draw in terms of tourism to the area and is also a local attraction for local people, so there’s a good combination in terms of those who avail of the attraction.“I hope whoever buys it does so with a view to keeping it as a going concern.”People expressed their dismay on our Facebook site at the thought of losing the age-old fun park.Janine Swindell said: “I thinkit is made into homes or a hotel, it would ruin Portrush’s tourism. Everyone has happy memories from Barry’s. It is such a great attraction.“I really hope someone buys it as a going concern. Would be devastated to see Barry’s go.”Wayne Bright added: “Hope someone takes over this and keeps it going. Wouldn’t be Portrush without Barry’s. Tourism would just go downhill.”David Armstrong said: “Barry#s is what makes Portrush. If there is no Barry#s, there might as well be no Portrush.”But David Kirkland wrote: “Everything has its time, and Barry’s is overdue”.A petition to save the venue from permanent closure previously attracted thousands of signatures.But the Trufelli family said it was their intention to “re-market the business for sale”, adding that the sales process had been hindered by the pandemic and resulting economic conditions.“Whilst our hope is that we will be able to sell the business as a going concern, we recognise that it may not be possible to find a suitable purchaser,” they said.“As a result, we have appointed Savills and Philip Tweedie  Company to market the site as both a going concern and a development opportunity.“Barry’s continues to remain closed in line with Covid restrictions and will not reopen until the sale process has concluded.”Barry’s, which sits on the Castle Erin Road seafront, opened in Portrush in  after members of two circus families, Evelyn Chipperfield and Francesco Trufelli, met in Ireland and later married.They continued to tour the country together before, in , they were invited by the Railway Company to set up a permanent site in Portrush.It is believed to be Ireland#s longest-running amusement park and stayed open every summer throughout the Troubles.It has been closed since the summer of .In February last year, Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council voted not to issue a Building Preservation Notice on the site.Neal Morrison, director of Savills Ireland, said: We expect demand to be strong due to the potential that this site offers.Philip Tweedie, of Philip Tweedie  Company, added: This is in essence the last true seafront site available in Portrush town. It should attract a high level of interest from a mix of entrepreneurs and property developers far and wide.Belfast Related ContentComment PremiumClaire WilliamsonOpinionThe smell of candy floss when you walked through the door at Barry’s transported you back in timeIt’s a place synonymous with childhoods across Northern Ireland and beyond.  Northern IrelandBarry’s Amusements on market for £. million as sale could spell end of tourist attractionBarry’s Amusements has been placed on the market for £,m with the site to remain closed until the popular tourist attraction is sold, according to the owners.Most ReadPeter Robinson warns Union at risknew DUP leader appeals to ‘extremes’Draperstown man Michael Conway dies after falling into Donegal riverFormer Presbyterian moderator joins ex-IRA man on SDLP’s Irish unity groupNon-essential cross-border travel must be stopped ‘by enforcementrequired’Astonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesTop VideosPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!Latest Northern IrelandGFA unionists hit out at leaders over Northern Ireland ProtocolUnionist negotiators of Good Friday Agreement call for suspension of NI ProtocolClaire WilliamsonOpinionThe smell of candy floss when you walked through the door at Barry’s transported you back in timeForeign travel rules to be ‘broadly similar’ across devolved nations – ShappsCarson#s lost children: ‘People went to sleep under the Union flag and woke up under the tricolour’LatestGFA unionists hit out at leaders over Northern Ireland ProtocolKey questions around the hosting of the Champions League final answeredScottish Labour down one seat but deputy leader increases majorityArmy to receive  of ‘most lethal’ battle tanks in EuropeBilly Joe Saunders eyes ‘greatest win by a Brit abroad’ ahead of Canelo clash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit : Test PixMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailIn the  years since I worked on the Good Friday Agreement and its implementation I have been involved in many other peace processes around the world, from Colombia to Mozambique.There is always a stage you reach in every successful process when you have to find a way to confront the past so you can move forward. Otherwise you just keep being dragged back into the very history you are trying so hard to escape.I am no fan of the way this Conservative government has handled Northern Ireland nor do I know what their plan is with regard to the legacy of the Troubles, partially leaked yesterday and condemned by most political leaders in Northern Ireland.I certainly believe it would be wrong to have a one-sided amnesty just for soldiers and policemen and their role in the Troubles.Buttheir plan is to deal with the past in an even-handed way in consultation with victims, and with the Irish government, and establish a workable truth and reconciliation process, then I would welcome it as the only way in which Northern Ireland can finally move on.We tried before Tony Blair left office to find such a route to truth and reconciliation by establishing the Eames-Bradley Commission in . Unfortunately it was unable to find a consensus on the way forward.And since then we have seen peace repeatedly interrupted by the arrest of republican leaders, like Gerry Adams in , and the attempted prosecution of police and soldiers for crimes committed during the Troubles.Substantial police resources are being poured into historical investigations and prosecutions which are rarely successful and almost never bring satisfaction to any side. Contrast that with the healing brought about by the Bloody Sunday inquiry exposing the truth of what happened on that terrible day to all the families who had suffered for so long.Blanket amnesties are no longer right or even possible in modern conflicts. And this is a deeply sensitive issue in which the rights of victims who have suffered so much should be central.But you have to balance peace and justice rather than being absolute about either — you don’t want to create more victims in the future at the cost of trying to secure absolute justice for victims of the past.That is why in other peace processes the two sides have opted for transitional justice programmes, as in Colombia, or truth and reconciliation programmes as in South Africa.What most victims want are the facts about what happened, that those responsible acknowledge their responsibility and to find a way to reach closure.In Northern Ireland, as where in the world, that has to be done through a process that does not necessarily end up in court, which in any case, as time passes, is less and likely to result in a successful prosecution.It needs to be a system tailored specically for Northern Ireland. But examples where in the world show there are ways forward where there is imagination and the political will to face the past.I hope that rather than just preventing the prosecution of the security forces for crimes committed in the Troubles, the Government will now consult victims, political parties and civil society in Northern Ireland as well as the Irish government on the right way to establish a new process of truth and reconciliation.If not, Northern Ireland’s progress towards a lasting peace risks being constantly interrupted by the reappearance of the bloody history from which it is trying to escape.Jonathan Powell was chief of staff to Tony Blair and chief British negotiator in Northern Ireland from -Belfast Most ReadPeter Robinson warns Union at risknew DUP leader appeals to ‘extremes’Draperstown man Michael Conway dies after falling into Donegal riverFormer Presbyterian moderator joins ex-IRA man on SDLP’s Irish unity groupNon-essential cross-border travel must be stopped ‘by enforcementrequired’Astonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesTop VideosPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!PlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership raceLatest Northern IrelandUnionist negotiators of Good Friday Agreement call for suspension of NI ProtocolClaire WilliamsonOpinionThe smell of candy floss when you walked through the door at Barry’s transported you back in timeForeign travel rules to be ‘broadly similar’ across devolved nations – ShappsFuture of Portrush’s Barry’s Amusements hangs in balanceCarson#s lost children: ‘People went to sleep under the Union flag and woke up under the tricolour’LatestBilly Joe Saunders eyes ‘greatest win by a Brit abroad’ ahead of Canelo clashSNP majority still uncertain, despite Nicola Sturgeon’s party making gainsSAS: Who Dares Wins says it treats all contestants the same following complaintUnionist negotiators of Good Friday Agreement call for suspension of NI ProtocolStarmer under pressure after ‘bitterly disappointing’ Hartlepool defeat,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said the others wanted to stay anonymous because they were nervous of Sinn Fein.He claimed he was one of the only journalists in Ireland who tackled Sinn Fein at the hard end and that the account used robust political tweets aimed at tough political people.Mr Harris said any fair minded person would see the account as a generally benign account andit did criticise people, they were Sinn Fein enablers or pawns.In another interview with RTE Raidio na Gaeltachta, Mr Harris said he was the one who revealed himself as one of those behind the Twitter accounts. “Nobody outed me, I outed myself - I was the one who admitted to the Sunday Independent, he said. Sunday Independent editor Alan English#s firing of him was an overreaction, he added. I#m not embarrassed of the Tweets on [the account], they#re good Tweets.Six or seven others were also involved in the Twitter account, he said. A Twitter spokesperson said on Friday: “The account was permanently suspended for violating the Twitter rules on  manipulation and spam.”Twitter declined to give more detail about the specics of why it was suspended.However, its rules on ‘manipulation and spam” state that users “can’t mislead others on Twitter by operating fake accounts”.While pseudonymous accounts are allowed, Twitter suspends accounts for “inauthentic engagements that attempt to make accounts or content appear more popular or active than they are”. It also bans “coordinated activity that attempts to articially influence conversations through the use of multiple accounts or fake accounts”.The spokesperson declined to ulge the identy of the eight other “linked” accounts that have now also been suspended.“Platform manipulation is strictly prohibited under the Twitter rules,” the Twitter spokesperson said.“We also suspended eight accounts linked to the account referenced for violating our policy on  manipulation and spam.”She said that the eight accounts were detected “using technology and human review” to “proactively monitor Twitter to identy attempts at  manipulation and mitigate them”.Mr Harris told independent.ie that he has appealed Twitter’s decision but has not been given any indication of when the appeal will be resolved. He said that one of the other accounts to be suspended belongs to a sister, Brigid McIntyre.Mr Harris also denied “running or curating” any other Twitter accounts.Mr Harris denied sending “messages” to Irish Examiner journalist Aoe Grace Moore.On Thursday, Ms Moore tweeted: “this account sent me sexualised messages about whether Mary Lou McDonald “turned me on”, the size of my arse and called me a terrorist from the month I started at the Examiner. Since then, I’ve had to go to counselling and the guards.”Mr Harris denies what he describes as the “implication” that Ms Moore was “private messaged”.“I never sent her any message of any sort about anything,” he said.However, his @BarbaraPym account publicly tweeted at Ms Moore’s Twitter account: “So that’s what turns you on ” in reference to Ms Moore’s tweet about Mary Lou McDonald becoming the first female opposition leader.Mr Harris described being let go by the Sunday Independent as “a very severe reaction”. He said that he would have expected a “reprimand” and “a warning not to do it again”.Mr Harris said that he did not know whether he would continue writing because being let go from the Sunday Independent was “a brutal blow”.Aoe Grace Moore declined to comment further when contacted by independent.ie.Independent.ieMost ReadPeter Robinson warns Union at risknew DUP leader appeals to ‘extremes’Total funds at controversial Green Pastures Church rise to £mDraperstown man Michael Conway dies after falling into Donegal riverEx-Irish soldier Lisa Smith who moved to Syria and married jihadist wins legal battle over NI banNon-essential cross-border travel must be stopped ‘by enforcementrequired’Top VideosPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!Latest Northern IrelandGFA unionists hit out at leaders over Northern Ireland ProtocolUnionist negotiators of Good Friday Agreement call for suspension of NI ProtocolClaire WilliamsonOpinionThe smell of candy floss when you walked through the door at Barry’s transported you back in timeForeign travel rules to be ‘broadly similar’ across devolved nations – ShappsFuture of Portrush’s Barry’s Amusements hangs in balanceLatestGFA unionists hit out at leaders over Northern Ireland ProtocolLabour claims ‘extraordinary results’ in Welsh Parliament electionKey questions around the hosting of the Champions League final answeredScottish Labour down one seat but deputy leader increases majorityArmy to receive  of ‘most lethal’ battle tanks in Europe,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

extraordinary results in welsh parliament election","story":"First Minister Mark Drakeford  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFirst Minister Mark Drakeford By Adam Hale, PA Wales CorrespondentMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMark Drakeford’s Welsh Labour has declared its strong Senedd election performance as “an extraordinary set of results in extraordinary times” as the party look favourite to retain control of the Welsh Government.The party has exceeded expectations as counting for the Welsh Parliament election continues, having so far lost just one of its seats and taking Rhondda from Plaid Cymru’s former leader Leanne Wood.Polling at the start of the campaign suggested Labour was facing its worst ever result and was at risk of winning as few as  of the Senedd’s  seats, a loss of seven from , though later polls suggested a stronger showing.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_afbf-fa--e-bcffb_embedded

sources said retaining all of its seats in the Senedd remained “a massive challenge”.Commenting on the “remarkable turnaround” on Friday evening, a Labour spokesperson said: “It is increasingly clear that people across Wales have put their faith in Welsh Labour and Mark Drakeford to lead the next Welsh Government and lead Wales out of the pandemic.”Health minister Vaughan Gething held his Cardf South and Penarth seat with , votes , a increase of , votes from , and said Labour and Mr Drakeford’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic was a “major factor” in the party’s results.He told the PA news agency: “We’ve had to make le-changing choices that affected every single family in the country.“The pandemic has thrust the First Minister in the spotlight, and most people like what they’ve seen in the way he’s handled the pandemic.“What we now need to do is understand what that means for the future government for Wales, how we handle this next phase finishing up the pandemic response, and then the dficult task of recovery – one that I think we’re in the best possible place for.”Mr Drakeford said earlier on Friday that signs of a strong Labour performance reflected the “real enthusiasm” he had encountered on doorsteps.Labour are on  seats, the Tories on eight, and Plaid Cymru on five with two more constituency declarations to go, including Mr Drakeford’s Cardf West constituency.Labour said Plaid Cymru had “imploded” in losing its Rhondda seat to Labour’s Elizabeth Buffy Williams and failing to take target seats Llanelli and Aberconwy.Rhondda’s outgoing MS, Leanne Wood, told ITV Wales the result was “disappointing”, but said her party ran a “clean and honest campaign”.Labour’s strong results will minimise its reliance on other parties in order to form a government, with Plaid previously thought as the most likely to enter into a coalition with them were Labour some way short of a majority.Only one of Wales’ so-called red wall seats, the Vale of Clwyd, fell to the Welsh Conservatives.Wrexham, Clwyd South and Delyn, were all held despite being targeted by the Tories after they flipped them from Labour in the  general election.Welsh Tory leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies said his party’s taking of Vale of Clwyd from Labour was a “brilliant result”, but suggested traditional Labour voters who voted Tory in the  general election had now “come home”.Mr Davies told the PA news agency: “It does seem from other seats that have been declared in other parts of Wales that the Labour voters have come home to it after the, shall we say, Brexit election of .The final make-up of the next Senedd will not be confirmed until the weekend with final regional results expected on Saturday.PAMost ReadPeter Robinson warns Union at risknew DUP

A media briefing was held on Tuesday where the Trust revealed that over  per cent of care home residents have been inoculated. According to Dr Bob Brown, Executive Director of Nursing Primary Care and Older Peoples services, there has also been a ‘very good response’ amongst care home staff. The Trust previously stated that  per cent of care home staff had accepted the vaccine. There are currently no Covid outbreaks in local care homes. The Trust provides care for over , service users in their own homes every day. There has been  per cent vaccine uptake amongst home care staff. googletag.cmd.push Information on vaccine uptake amongst hospital staff and Trust-wide numbers are not available, the meeting heard. Dr Brown explained: “I would say that’s not information that we would be providing on the basis that we cannot ask iniduals, have you or have you not had a vaccine.” “Therefore, we’re working on the basis of exit information. We know we’ve had an increasingly positive uptake but, he said, it’s dficult to provide evidence of specic numbers in each area.” Askedstaff on high-risk hospital wards would be encouraged to take the vaccine, such as those who treat cancer patients, he said: “We’ll certainly use every opportunity we can through our leadership walks to encourage uptake of the vaccine, that’s something as a corporate management team that we have taken as a priority in recent weeks, to absolutely do that.” googletag.cmd.push Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen added: “We continue to have very stringent infection control measures at ward level, continue to have the use of PPE and social distancing as far as possible. “So those measures remain in force and are continually monitored and encouraged by ourselves. “The vaccine is another line of defence but we always will adhere to the very high levels of PPE and infection control at clinical patient contact level.” The prospect of another wave of infections was raised at the media briefing. Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals, said there is some data which assures the Trust ‘no high surge’ is anticipated over the summer but a ‘small spike’ could take place at the end of Autumn and beginning of Winter.     She continued: “That would be normal winter pressures and respiratory disease so we’re not surethere would be any additional spike there due to Covid. “That’s the basic information we have at this time.” Dr Kilgallen encouraged the public to take the vaccine and adhere to restrictions to allow the Trust and wider NHS to treat other important health issues. “Take the vaccine when it’s offered but also be aware that restrictions that remain are in our best interests and we should do our best to comply at all times,” she said. ‘VOLUNTARY’ A debate has been ongoing in other parts of the UK about whether the vaccine should be mandatory for care home staff or those working in high-risk areas. The Derry News lodged Freedom of Information requests with the Western Trust, Health and Social Care Board and Department of Health- which oversees the running of the programme - to get a detailed breakdown of vaccine uptake amongst staff. In response, each organisation said it did not hold the information. The DoH explained that thevaccinationprogramme remains voluntary but where uptake is lower than average staff will be ‘encouraged’ to accept the vaccine. A spokesperson said: “As cohorts become eligible, iniduals make their own decisions about stepping forward forvaccination. “The Department does not routinely record reasons why people choose not to bevaccinated. “As the programme proceeds and more information becomes available on uptake rates within particular parts of the HSC workforce, action will be taken to try and encourage uptake in any areas where the uptake levels remains lower than average.” The DoH believes that overall, there has been a ‘good uptake’ of thevaccineamongst health and social care staff. More detailed data will be available in the coming weeks, a spokesperson said. She concluded: “This will enable the Department and Trusts to drill down and obtain more granular data regarding the ious parts of the health service andnecessary focus on those areas with lower uptake rates.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was more than just sport.As teams go back to training, it makes me think how clubs have a second chance to make a first impression on our youth. Just as a teacher can shape the career path of a student, a coach and sporting memories will determine how far a player will develop.

People will point to the size of their catchment area, but it wasnt until they organised themselves properly that things started to change.Underage coaching in clubs should be about bringing everyone up a level.Not only will it give everyone an enjoyable experience, which is the number one priority, But, in the long term, it will be a much healthier club.I always remember chatting to Crossmaglen player Cathal Short and looking on with envy at their success. What made them stand out  Yes, they had county players like himself, Oisin McConville, the McEntees and Francie Bellew. But, in club football, , on a given day, the county players from each team were to cancel each other out, Cross other players were of a higher standard. This made the dference.His uncle Aidan, a coach at the club and former teacher in St Patricks Maghera, spoke at an underage coaching camp I attended one weekend in St Marys Magherafelt. He revealed something that has always stuck out.Other clubs in Armagh judged themselves on being able to beat Crossmaglen at underage level. A victory over the Rangers constituted a successful year.In Cross, their benchmark was for the minor team to produce at least four players, every year, to push into the senior  the following season.They didnt concentrate on just the elite. Some years they would churn out more, but four was always the target. Underage medals were a welcome addition and driving the standards of coaching would iniably have them at the cutting edge of competitions.Their underage teams seeing All-Ireland titles being paraded into the hall helped with the motivation, but it still doesnt kick the ball over the bar for you.The biggest challenge in the GAA is giving everyone a chance to play on a regular basis. The Go Games format at the younger ages has been brilliant in terms of smaller sided games. Not only does it give more touches, but a  of  can be split into three teams of seven. There will be no subs and everyone has the chance to test their coaching in a game.The problem started at U level, with full dug-outs. A bigger club, of which there are a few, can add in a few extra Us to take the total to  and enter two U teams. Its not ideal,there is a case of playing across two codes – football and hurling or camogie.The case mentioned above is common, with three teams of seven becoming a team of , with  subs. This is where underage coaches need to ask themselves questions How can I finish the season with  players still coming to coaching sessions  We have all heard stories of the top three or four players not going as far as senior level. Emigration, injury, a loss of interest or their sheer size at underage no longer allowing them to dominate a game at minor level and above.In the long term, its bringing everyone up the ranks so that come senior level, there are enough numbers to field senior and reserve teams with regularity. Thats a healthy club.Bringing more players up through the underage grades is more important than success. Winning the odd trophy is great andyou are able to win U, U, U and minor titles while bringing everyone along, then thats the ultimate.Underage players will stick with youthey are getting games. In a squad of , like above, starting the same team every week is criminal. Ten minutes at the end of a game every week isnt development. It is tokenism.The greatest prize you can give anyoneis a starting jersey. Based on attendance at training, everyone should be given a chance to play a full game as often as possible. If someone is seen as a key player, use games to rotate them into dferent positions. Challenge them to use their weaker side, to develop a dummy. Give them the best possible chance to better themselves. By senior level, they will thank you for it.If you have big numbers at training, ide them up and play seven a side games. Two teams on, the other working on skills with another coach before swapping places. Introduce a competition every so often. Count the blocks, count the assists, count the dummies.

The guidelines, spread over two documents, offer bespoke advice depending on the category of care setting involved. “I fully recognise the importance of visiting for those who are receiving care. I hope this guidance will be widely welcomed, said Mr Swann. “It is also important to remember that the threat from COVID- remains very real. Everyone has a vital role to play when it comes to safe visiting. That includes social distancing, hand hygiene and not visitingyou are feeling unwell yourself.      Visiting was only ever restricted because it was absolutely necessary to do so to protect patients and residents from the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV- virus and subsequent development of COVID- infection. Given the progress that has been made against the virus, the time is now right to take steps to carefully re-introduce visiting.

Akintunde’s deflected shot squeezed past goalkeeper Michael Kelly to frustrate Longford, who thought they had all three points tanks to Rob Manley’s goal. City had not looked like scoring for most of the game after a positive start. Eoin Toal came close on  minutes when another Patching delivery tempted Kelly off his line, but the Longford goalkeeper missed the ball completely and Toal headed towards the open net, only for Dean Zambra to head the ball clear off the line. googletag.cmd.push Longford held out for the first half hour before they troubled the goal at the other end, and it was a decent chance as Shane Elworthy’s cross eluded Toal and landed on the head of Aaron Robinson, but the defender’s header was straight at Nathan Gartside. City were out of the blocks quickly in the second half in response to Ruaidhri Higgins asking for more, and Patching went direct this time, driving a shot at goal which Kelly couldn’t hold, but David Parkhouse couldn’t tur the rebound in under pressure from McDonnell. Derry came close again on  minutes as they began to create in the final third, and Kelly had to e fullto push away a Parkhouse header after Ciaran Coll’s cross. googletag.cmd.push Longford took the lead with just  minutes to go. A hopeful ball into the City area was not dealt with by the home defence and Rob Manley reacted quickest to the loose ball to hook it past Gartside from close range. Kelly kept out Patrick Ferry’s volley as Longford hung on desperately, but their resolve was eventually broken when the ball broke to Akintunde in the area and his shot on the turn somehow squeezed into the net much to Derry City’s relief.  Teams Derry City: Nathan Gartside, Ronan Boyce, Eoin Toal, Cameron McJannet, Ciaran Coll Jack Malone, Ciaron Harkin , Will Patching Will Fitzgerald , David Parkhouse, James Akintunde.     Longford Town: Michael Kelly, Shane Elworthy, Aaron Robinson , Michael McDonnell, Dean Zambra, Dylan Grimes, Aaron O’Driscoll, Karl Chambers, Dean Byrne , Aodh Dervin, Robert Manley.

Thats always been Cormac ODoherty. From the U playing in goals for Slaughtneils Feacuteile team, with a stick almost as big as him, to playing in the field at home with his older brothers and sisters, he has always had to learn fast. He sits relaxed in Owenbegs canteen. Wearing a customary red baseball hat and the same ice cool look as standing over frees on pitches across Ulster and beyond. Now , he has eight seasons of senior championship hurling under his belt with Slaughtneil and going into a fth at county level, having been called up by Collie McGurk in Derrys Nicky Rackard winning season. A veteran now. googletag.cmd.push “Maybe,” comes the reply, with a smirk and the same affable nature in which it was offered. “Its starting to feel that way, there are a lot of young boys involved so I am getting to the older half of the group now.” Last season, Slaughtneil hurling boss Michael McShane handed him the captains role and last Tuesday night he was appointed as Derry captain. “This is another big step, it is a challenge and something to look forward to...something that hopefully will be a successful one,” he points out. The new role doesnt bring pressure. The new skipper points to the leaders in the squad that still includes Sean Cassidy, captain under John McEvoy. googletag.cmd.push “We have a lot of players who have played big games, a lot of leaders and it is up to everyone to step up to the mark,” he adds. Personally, its about performing as well as he can. And hopefully the results will fall into place. Looking ahead, Sundays Mayo game is as far as he ventures. And looking back, the two promotion finals stick in the throat, but they are yesterdays news. “Thats done and dusted now, its a dferent year, its a dferent management, a few dferent players and a few dferent teams, so it is a new challenge,” he said.     In the last two seasons, Derrys scoring average was - versus - against. The margins are small. Goalkeeper Sean Kelly saved their bacon on many occasions, but at the other end they didnt lt the green flag often enough to trouble teams, when it matters. ODoherty is often the man picking open defences for club and county. He feels they need to be more clinical in the final third. “Its in the tight games, with a point or two each way. Its maybe that we can create them , but we didnt take them. It is costly in tight games.” It will be the third county management he has played under and he is enthused about having Cormac Hippy Donnelly in the frame, who coached Slaughtneil to two Ulster senior titles. “It is hard to put your finger on it,” said ODoherty of the input of Donnelly, who was a popular addition with the Derry players. “Mickeyhad been there and he came in with new ideas to the group and a fresh voice that gave us a bit of renewed energy. A new coach always brings new ideas. “Then you have Woodyssuccess with thecamogs, thats two experienced men. “They were good players and Cormac is new into management, we saw in Slaughtneil what he brings to the setup. “Then you back that up with Conorand Kevin , two players who gave a lot to Derry hurling and have that Derry experience, so hopefully that will stand to them.” Murray won back to back Ulster medals with Derry in and . “It is somethingthat we dont have the opportunity to do any more,” ODoherty adds. “He is somebody who had success with Derry senior hurlers and won major honours, it is great to see that and he brings something dferent to the party as well.” Of the  new players in this years , his brother Oisin makes a , with Gerald Bradley, Conor McAllister, Niall Ferris and Brian Cassidy. “It is a strong  of players,” Cormac states. “Ferryhas committed and it is something we have worked on over the past number of years, getting the best players out. We have managed that and it is a good opportunity to take advantage of it.” It has been something that has been a theme since Collie McGurk took over in , of getting the best players hurling for the county. “Collie was a big believer in getting the best players on the pitch and well see what happens after that. “Dominic and Cormac have put a very strong  together, it is up to the players to make use of it.” Getting off to a winning start in Mayo on Sunday is crucial. Despite the Kildare game poised in the distance as a potential top of the table clash in the group, ODoherty is keeping his thoughts in the short term. Any mention of the Christy Ring Cup is casually brushed off. If you start looking too far down the line youll get caught,” he said. “Our focus is on the Mayo game,you lose that then you are chasing for the rest of the league, so it is important to get a good start.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Collie McGurk took them from the Nicky Rackard Cup to the cusp of a Christy Ring Cup Final. An inspired goalkeeping performance from Kildare goalkeeper Paddy McKenna thwarted theirto Croke Park. Two years ago, John McEvoy came in as boss and an impressive season took them back to the league decider, where Derry lost to Wicklow in a low scoring afternoon at a blustery Inniskeen. A day when Brian Oacuteg McGilligan hobbled off after  minutes and the appearance of Brendan Rogers wasnt able to spark the goal they needed to take them over the line. googletag.cmd.push Last year, after ticking along nicely, Covid kicked in and when the league final was played, Derry werent at the races. It wasnt even a contest. Dominic Woody McKinley came in as joint manager this season, alongside Cormac Donnelly. McKinley, who managed both Derry senior hurlers and camogs in the past, knows what he wants from this season. “My personal opinion is that the National League is more important than the championship to us,” McKinley outlined. He has been around the block. An All-Ireland winner with Loughgiel in , an All-Ireland Final appearance with Antrim in , he coached Antrim at all levels and was a major cog in Slaughtneils rise to the pinnacle of camogie. googletag.cmd.push Sitting at Derry hurlers press evening last week, there is enthusiasm as he talks hurling. The words flow with a passion. The facial expressions dont tell any lies. Its about getting Derry up a level. There is a hurt that hurlers below the elite, top level counties dont get the recognition. Counties like Derry. Seven or eight of their squad are capable of playing at any level. When the Champion  - the All-Star team from the Christy Ring, Nicky Rackard and Lory Meagher Cups – was announced, Derry werent represented. “I suppose you have to earn that,” Woody admits. “The only way is to keep your head down, work hard and then people will recognise you as a group.     “I want Derry to get up a league, you get more of a profile for the players and get to play against better teams. “If you are playing at a higher standard, it is more attractive for the media and hurling people. If I had a choice, Id love to get moved up a league.” As our conversation continues, Liaison Officer Terry Gray issues a list of the Derry squad. Of the  names, Alan Grant is in rehab from a knee injury last year. The  is open, but McKinley is happy with the squad. Brian Cassidy, Niall Ferris and Gerald Bradley are back on board to give them extra attacking options. There is afor Slaughtneil goalkeeper Oisin ODoherty, who last donned the Derry goalkeeper jersey in  having played outfield the previous year. “That was the first thing we looked at before we got the job, could me and Cormac draw all these players all back in again,” he points out. Dual players arent on the table. Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers have played under the last two management teams. But it was a balancing act. The fixture calendar doesnt permit it. Mark Craig is managing his long-term back injury. Brian Cassidy and Conor McAllister are doubts for the Mayo game, but everyone should be available for selection. Challenge games arent on the menu. It frustrates McKinley, so an in-house game last weekend will have to do as they sharpen the focus for the season ahead. “A lot of wee niggly injuries are there now that club training has started as well,” adds McKinley, as frustration creeps into his voice, from the increased workload on the players. “We want to manage it so they are there for the full season for club and county.” There is a plea to clubs, who wont have their serious business until the heel of the year. “These matches are very important for Derry hurling as well,” he adds, while hailing the support of Chairman Stephen Barker. “He is very fair,” Woody states. “He is wanting progress. It is a serious business and we need to be serious about getting themup a level and thats what the players want.” The closest Derry came to promotion was their  decider, a day when Wicklows goal was the dference. Its Derrys failure to find the net that has left them on the wrong side of tight games. During the off-season, selector Conor Murray has been looking into the scoring statistics and Derrys know where the gains are to be made. “He came back to us and it is interesting reading,” McKinley said. “If you were looking at it from another teams point of view, you could think theyll capitalise on our team by blocking a couple of players off in our forward line and wed be in serious bother. “So we are looking for a greater spread of scores,you look at the players we have, there is no doubt we can.” McKinley questions Derrys team play, shot selection...all the pieces of the puzzle of their scoring conundrum. “Thats what weve been going over this last few weeks and hopefully we can get more out of it,” he continues. “We are even recording what we are scoring in our training games, what we do in each sector, to seeour scoring averages are up.” Now the challenge is taking it to Castlebar on Sunday.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Grade A listed building also known as ‘The People’s Hall,’ was the venue of choice for some of the world’s most iconic performers and notaries after it was built in . But how many people nowadays know that its remarkable guests included both Emmeline Pankhurst and Eleanor Marx   Emmeline Pankhurstwas the leader of the radical suffragette movement that played a key role in helping to win British women the right to vote. googletag.cmd.push She was founder of the Women’s Social and Political Union and gave a rousing speech in St Columb’s Hall on th October . Eleanor Marx, the daughter of German socialist revolutionary Karl Marx, organised a trade union recruitment drive for Derry’s mainly female factory workers in St Columb’s Hall on th November , just five years after the distinctive venue was built at Orchard Street within the Walled City. Friends of the Factories  “in solidarity with” Derry Trades Union Council, organised the placement of two plaques side by side to coincide with events to mark May Day weekend, the annual celebration of workers and union rights across the world. googletag.cmd.push The plaque erected in memory of Emmeline Pankhurst was a tribute shared with Margaret Cousins, the Irish and Indian suffragettewho attended Victoria High School in Derry. Co-founder of the Irish Women’s Franchise League, Dublin in , she was credited with organising and inviting Pankhurst to speak at St Columb’s Hall in . The plaque dedicated to Eleanor Marx who visited the Hall almost  years before Pankhurst, reads: “Eleanor Marx, Fighter for socialism and women’s rights . In this hall, th November , Eleanor launched a recruitment drive for women and general workers previously excluded from most union activity.     The organisation of Derry shirt factory workers was a key moment in the development of trades unionism in Britain and Ireland.” Yvonne Norris, local campaigner with Friends of the Factories , said: “Friends of the Factories came together at the most dficult of times, united in doing something positive by contributing to the legacy of the factory workers and their contribution to the City. I have been honoured to be part of an initiative made up of so many formidable women, driven by women and achieved by women. We thank the Derry Trades Union Council for their unwavering support of our project, it has got us to the point we have reached today. As well as the ceremony in honour of the two female revolutionary thinkers who addressed rallies in St Columb’s Hall, plaques to honour the legacy of the workers were also unveiled at a number of former shirt factory sites including Welch Margeston, Sinclair, Ebrington, Rosemount, Hogg  Mitchell and the City Factory. Anne-Marie Gallagher, Project Director of St Columb’s Hall, said she was delighted that the roles of three illustrious women historically associated with the venue, had finally been etched into the fabric of the building more than a century later. She said: “These beautul plaques are very much in keeping with the character of the Hall and add to the already vibrant story of Derry’s built heritage and history. The fact that these remarkable women left such a lasting legacy is very poignant, especially to think that they were standing in here over  years ago. “We are thankful to Friends of the Factories and Derry Trades Union Council for their foresight and determination in shining the spotlight on the somewhat lesser-known connections with this building’s rich history to the wider world.” St Columb’s Hall is located on the East Wall of the city’s historic Walls and was originally built in  by the St Columb’s Hall Total Abstinence Society as part of the Temperance movement. Now used as a noted conference and events venue, the building is currently in the midst of a major regeneration project.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Radius Housing is building  new homes in the Creggan area. The project will also bring major improvements to the facilities at Sean Dolan’s GAA club and the construction of a new multi-use community facility on the site. The project will transform the lands to the west of the current Sean Dolan GAC grounds at Bligh’s Lane and represents an investment in excess of poundmillion in the Creggan area. Planning permission was secured in January, and Radius has appointed P  K McKaigue as the contractor for the project, who will be on site in the coming weeks. googletag.cmd.push Radius is working with Sean Dolans GAC, Ulster GAA, Derry City and Strabane District Council, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the Department for Communities on the project. Alongside the signicant investment in  new social homes in an area of acute housing need, this project will support both Sean Dolan’s ambition to develop as a club and also the wider strategic plans of the GAA in growing the prominence of Gaelic games across the city. A range of other opportunities, activities and events, which will have a positive impact on the wider Creggan community, will also be facilitated as a result of the project. googletag.cmd.push Radius Housing is a leading housing developer, constructing more than  new social and affordable homes each year. Radius also manages more than , social homes, and provides care and support for many more across Northern Ireland. This project is the latest Radius development in Derry, with construction currently underway on the former site of Ebrington Primary School in the Waterside. Anita Conway, Director of Development at Radius Housing, said: “We are delighted that the construction of this major project is beginning, and we are excited by the ambition and benefits this will bring to the whole community. “We have been working with Sean Dolan’s GAC and the other partner organisations for over three years, and we see this as an innovative way to deliver high quality homes, in an area where social homes are needed, and support essential community development.     “As a developer we know the dficulties faced in acquiring suitable development land, and working with Sean Dolan’s we have both been able to develop an innovative partnership approach which addresses a wide range of needs in the local area. “Working with community based clubs like Sean Dolan’s allows Radius to help them realise their untapped potential, and bring much needed homes to the local area and maximise all available amenities within these areas for the benefit of the local communities. “This is so much more than a housing project and a sports hub. This will be a vital economic and social driver for the Creggan area and City wide.” Stephen McGeehan, Head of Operations for Ulster GAA, said: “Every GAA club is keen to develop the best facilities for their members, which allow their teams across all ages to develop their skills and increase fitness and wellbeing. “But there are always limitations on how this can be done, and we are delighted that Sean Dolan’s have been able to partner with Radius Housing on this amazing and far reaching project. “This will bring an incredible level of community benefit, not just to the club, but to the wider city area, and we hope it is a new partnership model which can be replicated in other GAA and sports clubs.” Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has welcomed commencement ofthework on the new much needed social homes in the city. “I’m delighted to see this work started. My priority is to deliver housing in areas where it is needed,and Derry City needs more housing. “This pound million investment is part of my new build programme, a programme I was able to secure poundmillion to be invested this year. “I commendthe work of Radius Housing and Sean Dolan’s GAC for working together on this ground breaking scheme. “This is co-operative working at its very best and I look forward to seeing the finished scheme in due course. “I look forward to seeing other developments in the near future as we continue to deliver the biggest shake up of our housing system in over  years. “Housing, and having a place to call home, is a fundamental right. I am committed to delivering a housing system that delivers rights to everyone across society.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The aim of the project is to create a one-stop online directory for people and families planning a day out in either or both counties. The councils have now issued a tender seeking companies who could create such a directory. In a joint statement included in the tender documents, the two councils state that they had commissioned an audience survey across the north west in a bid to better understand the barriers to cultural engagement faced by our citizens. googletag.cmd.push “This research was used to inform a subsequent Audience Development Plan which identied older people and families as two key audience target segments. “Older people were identied as a segment that was the least engaged with cultureand the partner councils were keen to ensure that this imbalance was addressed. “Families were identied as a market opportunity, an audience segment upon which the sector could focus the rebuilding of audiences and participatory engagement as we emerge from the worst of the Covid crisis. “The NW Audience Survey research findings and the NW Audience Development Plan The plan incorporates a range of actions designed to encourage better engagement of the target segments.” googletag.cmd.push As part of the process, the councils have looked at websites such as familyexplorers, dayoutwiththekids and fantasticforfamilies. They now want to create a similar website focused on the Derry and Donegal regions. “In essence the project is designed to make it simpler for families to plan days out by providing all the practical information in one place,” the council statement concluded.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Criticising the lack of facilities at Ballyarnett Country Park, Davy Cregan said as a disabled and wheel- chair-bound person enough is enough. “There are no toilets facilities and as result people have to take themselves and their children to Northside shopping centre for toilets. This is a human rights abuse,” claimed Mr Cregan. Emmet Doyle, Aontu councillor for the Ballyarnett district electoral area, said he had received a number of queries from residents and park users around access to bathrooms, general maintenance, surfacing and disabled access.  googletag.cmd.push He added: “I have spoken to the Director of Parks around all of these and we are currently looking at utilising the Earhart Cottage for bathroom access and I will keep monitoring how we improve this community asset for all users.” In response, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council pointed out there were no public conveniences in any of its parks. The spokesperson added: “Council and a number of local businesses across the council area have developed aCommunity Toilet Scheme which allows members of the public to use their toilet facilities for free during normal opening hours without having to make a purchase. googletag.cmd.push “The initiative ensures that clean, safe and easily accessible toilets are available to the public at no cost. “Participating businesses are paid an annual fee by council-based on the facilities they have available. The spokesperson added: “A full list of participating businesses is available on the Council website. “A large number of businesses who are not registered to the Community Toilet Scheme also permit members of the public to use their facilities,” concluded the local councils spokesperson.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it. All I can do is pray for them.During lockdown Mr Ahern shared how he went to mass regularly from his kitchen in Drumcondra, sharing masses online from Clonard monastery in Belfast, as well as Derry, Cork and Dublin.He said lockdown had given people time to reflect and enjoy walking, something he really enjoys.He told the podcasters mdash former Sisters of Adoration who are now pilgrim guides on Saint Patrickrsquos Way Downpatrick mdash that ldquohe would love to come and walk the Irish Camino with them.He revealed he had spent nine months of the lockdown reading The Annals of the Four Masters, chronicles of medieval Irish history.Mr Ahern described it as a ldquotough read, admitting he could only manage  pages a day.Asked what he would like to banish from Ireland, in the Spirit of St Patrick, he said ldquoinjustice and violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Breast.jpg","title":"Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing  ","story":"WHEN Joanne Masseyrsquos second child, Edward, was born six months ago, she knew she wanted to breastfeed him, but also,possible, donate to the milk bank.Weighing in at just over lbs, Edward fed for  minutes soon after he was born and it seemed like establishing feeding would be no problem.However, a few months before Edward was born, Joannersquos family found out her father, Jim Watson, had cancer.She explained: ldquoEventually we would learn it was terminal. So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey. So often there isnrsquot enough support available for mums especially with breastfeeding, and Covid made it more dficult as the usual support groups had all closed. Thatrsquos why peer support is so valuable as it provides one to one support for mums at the most important time.Aine highlighted the need for support for breastfeeding mums. ldquoWe need to be offering all mums support from the very first chance which is the case for a lot, but sometimes mums donrsquot know about us until itrsquos too late. ldquoI am thankful to Joanne for sharing this experience with me and I know we will still be in touch for a long time.ldquoAnd even though Irsquom sure she will downplay what she has achieved, I can honestly say I am so proud of her and all her hard work.Mothers can be referred to the Trustrsquos breastfeeding support worker through midwery and health visiting services..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Carlisle.jpg","title":"Carlisle’s staff in charity hike in memory of much loved Pat  ","story":"ONE hundred staff and friends at Carlislersquos in Ballynahinch are each walking five miles this week on a sponsored walk in honour of a much-loved colleague who died last month.Pat Greene, who was from Saintfield, died on April , much to the shock and sorrow of everyone at the business.The  year-old had worked for Carlislersquos for  years, starting off as a coal boy, going on to work in all areas of the business and finishing as a work supervisor.Donna Carlisle explained that Pat loved The Proclaimers song Irsquom Gonna Beand it inspired the charity effort from staff members, past and present, and their partners.ldquoIt was Patrsquos favourite song and it had to be on the playlist at all our party nights when we raised money for ious cancer charities. Raising money for these charities was always important to Patrick as his mother sadly passed away from the disease when he was young, she said.ldquoHe never missed any of the parties and when The Proclaimers came on I always remember Pat taking centre stage and all of us had to follow him and his actions and it was always very important we did it right.ldquoThis is one memory of Pat we will never forget.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

It didnrsquot sink in until I was driving away from the ceremony and it was a great feeling.The jump jockey star first began his interest in horses after watching the races at Downpatrick Racecourse with his family when he was just eight years old. Since then, he carried on visiting the local racetrack with friends and soon caught the racing bug.ldquoI went to a few point-to-pointers with the McCartan family who we know well. It wasnrsquot long after that I got on the saddle for the first time and I got going from there, said Danny.The golden boy started off with Downpatrick trainer Brian Hamilton before working with group one winning flat trainer Ger Lyons in Kildare.On the advice of former Grand National winner Tony Dobbin, Danny then made his big move across the water to Penrith in Cumbria to work under the highly respected trainer Nicky Richards at his famous Greystoke stables.ldquoI was only  when I turned professional and made the move to England. I was very nervous, but Nicky made me feel really welcomed and I settled in quickly, he recalled.ldquoIt was tough at the beginning to be fair but Nicky is very easy to get on with and he knew it was going to be dficult for me.

We have competed a lot together and Irsquove developed my skills with him a lot, we have picked up six or seven wins this season together he said.ldquoThat horse has helped me get to the grade one stage of racing, especially after our massive grade two win.That grade two success was when Danny and Nuts Well secured first place in the valuable Old Roan at Aintree. Nuts Well was picked for an outsider in the race at  , but the talented rider once again showed he was worth his salt as he galloped to glory.This gave Northumberland trainer Ann Hamilton her biggest success to date as they claimed the pound, prize pot.Despite his interest and success in racing, Danny was the first in his family to become heavily involved in the sport.ldquoI come from a sporting background in my family, my two brothers played Gaelic football and soccer growingup, but I was the one who took it upon myself to get into the horses, he said.ldquoOf course my family supported me and helped me achieve were I am today, but I do not come from a racing background.Dannyrsquos parents, Brenda and Denis, were delighted as their son received recognition for an outstanding season and hope that this is just the beginning for the promising young talent.ldquoWe are so proud of him, he has done all of this off his own back, said Brenda.ldquoHe has worked extremely hard to get to this point and I am so glad he is living his dream.ldquoEven though I canrsquot watch his big hurdle races until the final straight as I always have a motherrsquos worry, she added.Danny spent a brief time back with family in Downpatrick but is getting back to business as usual in England.ldquoI just plan on keeping my head down and hope to bring the momentum from this season into the next one, he said.ldquoEverything wouldnrsquot be possible without the help from all of the team at the stables and my familyrsquos support.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost.

Joanne Carson is credited with coming up with a pleasing route for her buddies, Helen Vint, Mags Flynn and Cathy Burke.These girls are to be seen most weekends, rain, hail or shine, chalking up miles in and around Downpatrick. Their dedication is most commendable. In their opinion, a half marathon is long enough to challenge the legs but not as draining as a full marathon so you could almost say that it is an enjoyable task.Joanne got them off to a familiar start. They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

Disposable barbecues are bad for the environment in terms of use and disposal, said the resident.ldquoThese barbecues are made using unsustainable materials from tropical forests in South Africa and South America.ldquoThey canrsquot be recycled, burn grass and typically result in scattered litter. Just like Chinese sky lanterns which the local council previously took action on and which were also once acceptable, the time has come to ban disposable barbecues.The resident said disposable barbecues represent a ldquohuge fire risk, burn the ground underneath them, are often left as litter and contain sharp pieces that can harm animalstrodden on.She added: ldquoThey are used in beauty spots, wildle reserves and on beaches and are just left smouldering. They make it far too easy for people to be irresponsible by putting them directly on the ground and then leaving them there afterwards.ldquoLiving in an area of natural beauty we have many areas were people see fit to light a barbecue. The recent events have shown us we cannot take the risk. The earth is too fragile and the danger to humans and wildle is too great.

Yet there has been violence since then. Steps to end the Troubles led to  Belfast AgreementLooking back is important, at least in so far as it helps one to understand the present better and to look to the future with realism.History has much to teach every generation for the good of the future.That is one important reason why Remembrance Day every November should remain a permanent fixture.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...By recalling the history we are helped to remind ourselves of the horrors of war.The Irish Church Leaders Group — comprising the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh, the Presbyterian Moderator, the Methodist President and the President of the Irish Council of Churches — has issued an apt Centenary Prayer which in part reads: “As we travel onwards in our journey, may we learn from the experiences of the past and from those who trod these roads before us, so that the inheritance we pass on to the next generation is the gt of understanding, peace and hope.”There will of course be dferent feelings about this centenary and dferent understandings of our history but, given honest and patient dialogue, a more shared understanding is not impossible.Also, those who have lived in Northern Ireland, no matter what their political aspirations or historical perspectives may be, will surely be able to point to things for which they are grateful.Partition in  was for the purpose of avoiding civil war.Yet, there has been violence since then.Once again, steps were taken to end the violence of the Troubles, resulting in the settlement of the Belfast Agreement of  followed by the  St Andrews Agreement.It is the responsibility facing everyone in Northern Ireland today, and everyone with the welfare Northern Ireland at heart, to work at that peace, making it more durable, more secure, not least by carefully observing the balances built into the Belfast Agreement.Peace provides the opportunity for jobs, for prosperity, for a more secure, settled and contented le.For those who feel deprived of their aspiration for a dferent island in which Northern Ireland joins with the Republic, there can be thankfulness at least for the settlement which accords the majority the right to change the constitutional circumstances.The Belfast Agreement provides for the people of Northern Ireland to vote to join the Republic in a referendum called by the Secretary of Stateand when he or she believes there is a majority wanting that change.Because there also has to be a referendum in the Republic, taking this step provided for in the Belfast Agreement would implicitly require both the British and Irish governments to be in agreement with proceeding in this way.If we can learn one thing from the very recent history of the whole Brexit scenario it is surely that before people vote on a major change of national circumstances there should be a clear understanding of just what that change would entail.For that reason, as and when a border poll takes place on this island, everyone should know exactly what voting for a change would mean in practical terms.University College London’s Independent Commission on Referendums has carried out considerable work on the implications of holding such plebiscites, highlighting many issues, such as campaigning, financing, standards of discourse, the digital factor and the wording of the question itself.As the commission’s report has indicated, there naturally has to be clarity about a referendum proposal. In the Brexit scenario, the withdrawal agreement came after the decision was made in principle and there was no referendum on the withdrawal agreement but only a parliamentary vote.Two ways of doing things better in any future referendum are either by setting out the details in advance of any referendum, as happened with the Belfast Agreement, or by holding a two-stage referendum in which the principle of change is decided in the first vote, which is then followed by the detailed negotiations, leading to a second confirmatory vote.This would not be voting again on the same question but would be to set out on a referendum process that clearly has two dferent stages.A two-stage referendum would avoid the need for detailed negotiationsat the first, ‘in principle’ stage the decision were not to make any change. It would also create the right environment in which to hold detailed negotiations should change have been chosen in principle.We live in a society that is becoming more and more religiously plural. For that reason, in marking this centenary it would be good , in addition to church services, there were an opportunity for leaders of dferent faiths to come together, possibly in an online conference, to discuss common concerns such as global religious freedom and charitable works.There are certain dficulties inherent in what is called ‘interfaith worship’ but there surely can be no dficulty in people of dferent faiths meeting, declaring good relations between their communities and seeking to promote mutual religious interests.• Canon Ian Ellis is a former editor of The Church of Ireland Gazette——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The secretary of state’s sparse statement in March  did presage a narrowing of the ludicrously overblown Stormont House Agreementarrangements on re-investigation and ‘truth recovery’.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...These were not agreed by all parties, while the NIO’s  draft Bill went far beyond SHA by creating a new offence of historic police misconduct. It also promised a police force of the past, the Historical Investigations Unit , to both investigate and judge past crimes, a travesty of our human rights commitments in ECHR Article  and .In the event, what the NIO is now spinning in the London press is a two-winged policy liable to fail from being neither fish nor fowl. Howeverthe HIU and Stormont House are out we have an advance of sorts.Their tacked-on truth and reconciliation concept is dead in the water following the A and C case. The advice is already out from retired generals to squaddies, who say: ‘have nothing to do with anyone knocking your door wanting to talk about truth recovery and reconciliation’. The paramilitarieslearnt their lesson after being recorded in the Boston Tapes debacle. That ended in police investigations and prosecutions. Nobody can risk believing that a no-prosecution policy today would not be followed by the opposite tomorrow. The mantra of truth, justice and reconciliation is a  god. Historians alone can bring you toward a synthesis of what constitutes the truth while lack of evidence for prosecutions means justice for some , families is impossible. Continuing lawfare against the state only worsens community relations. Is this an NIO amnesty  First we have % of an amnesty already in place with early release of prisoners and the OTR letters of comfort etc.An end to all prosecutions, perhaps in the form of a ‘stay’ has been advocated by many. But next to no prosecutions against paramilitaries will ever be started. Veterans however are increasingly liable to charge due to the PSNI choosing to re-open investigation into all the  security force caused deaths. This occurred after the Historical Enquiries Teamwas destroyed in the HMIC Otter report. It discovered what was always the case, that Hugh Orde had created an information recovery operation, not based on standard policing procedures. Yet it had been agreed by the ECHR Committee of Ministers.That proves that compliance with ‘Article ’, which seeks to protect le and is often cited in cases against state forces, compliance’ can be achieved in a dozen dferent waysthe Committee can be brought round diplomatically. There is no sign however that our Ambassador at Strasbourg is working to that end on the other  member states. Ireland can be excluded as it has the whip hand beingone of six countries on ‘the Bureau’ that controls the Committee agenda.Kenova under Jon Boutcher with its currently limited remit is very willing to take on all , historic cases with a required budget of billions and a two-decade operation. But why should a murder case in s Belfast be re-opened without credible and compelling new evidencethe same would never happen in Birmingham  The NIO has long promised equivalent protection from prosecution and to a degree re-investigation for veterans who served in Northern Ireland as those in Iraq and Afghanistan are getting in the Overseas Operations Act. That act is no amnesty, rather it has put in place extra hurdles before a prosecution can start. They involve time limits, new evidence, the military context , the public interest in finality and the level of previous investigation. It also allows for a current prosecution to be discontinued.The NIO seems to have either boldly decided to scrap all future prosecutions or been advised thatit only addresses veterans it will be arraigned in the Courts and eventually at Strasbourg for discrimination. Fear of court action has probably been key to a general no-prosecution decision, one that will please no one. It would be best to proceed with protections for veterans alone and deal with the inevitable storm from Dublin, Amnesty International and the Alliance Party already being experienced.It is worth noting that the Supreme Court says on its website, “UK courts are not required, however, always to follow the decisions of the Strasbourg Court.Indeed, they can decline to do so, particularlythey consider that that Court has not sufficiently appreciated or accommodated particular aspects of our domestic constitutional position.” I doubt that Brandon Lewis was advised by government lawyers of that way forward.The key question is will no prosecutions mean no more re-investigation and thus an end to lawfare  Without closing down new inquests, civil suits, private prosecutions, free legal aid, judicial reviews etc, which are overwhelmingly examinations of the security forces, such a policy will do little or nothing to reduce the hurt, damage or cost. All wounds will remain open and festering.We await the detail in the Queen’s Speech but may get little.Jeffrey Dudgeon, Convenor of the Malone House Group on Legacy and Lawfare——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I’d have been taking him up to the club when things were normal and he’d be sitting about watching people having sandwiches and getting some of his own.“I remember one time I was getting a coke and bag of crisps at the bar and I said to the wee lad, ‘give me a bag of crisps for the dog’. He says, ‘what sort does he want ’ I said, ‘I don’t know, I’ve never asked him – sure just give him the box and he’ll pick his own’.“He handed me the box and the dog stuck his head in the box, rummaged about and came out with a packet of roast chicken.”The club was paid a visit by the IFA’s social media team ahead of last weekend’s Sadler’s Peaky Blinder Irish Cup tie against Newington FC to capture on film Beau’s exploits.

But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
