And, you know, microplastics are a real problem, especially the microplastics from fast-fashion. Did you know that\u0027s one of the biggest culprits?\u0027Bonnie Sheppard, 15, another Albert Park College student, said: \u0027Meghan was really interested in the effect of microplastics. I told her that there are more microplastics in the ocean than stars in the Milky Way, which she was surprised by.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s amazing what you guys are doing,\u0027 said Meghan. \u0027Well done, you\u0027re doing a really great job.

She\u0027s acting great at the moment,\u0027 Morgan said, adding that it was a \u0027red light when people behave like that, in an odd manner\u0027.Stefanovic hit back at Morgan during Thursday morning\u0027s Today show, saying his comments were \u0027disgraceful\u0027.\u0027I think she is an amazing, amazing woman and I think she\u0027s doing her very best at the moment, and she\u0027s got a lot on her plate and is doing it so beautifully,\u0027 Stefanovic said.\u0027She\u0027s such a great export for Great Britain, I mean - what is that guy on?\u0027Morgan replied to Stefanovic\u0027s outburst on Twitter, telling the Channel Nine presenter to \u0027pipe down\u0027.                                                    Carlo Foster, 12, an Albert Park Primary pupil, showed Harry and Meghan bags full of plastic cups, beakers and bottles he has collected. Harry said: \u0027Another worrying thing I\u0027m hearing is some people trying to claim things like these are actually habitats for fish and turtles. Don\u0027t ever let anyone convince you of that.\u0027The couple also spoke to Melisand Box, 14, from Albert Park College, who had a bag filled with plastic straws. She said: \u0027Harry told us to spread the message about whether people really need to use straws at all, and if they do, to use bamboo or metal straws.\u0027Harry and Meghan then did a \u0027mini-walkabout\u0027, greeting dozens of excited schoolchildren who had lined up on the beach to meet them. Among them was Amelia Marcom, 12, from St Kilda Primary school: \u0027I gave Meghan flowers, a picture of her and Harry I\u0027d drawn for them and some t-shirts for the baby. She said she loved them.\u0027Before leaving the beach, the couple strolled hand in hand down to the shoreline, to meet a group of lifeguards from Australia Surf Lifeguards. Sebastian Top, 20, a lifeguard for more than four years, asked Meghan, \u0027Are you going to swim today?\u0027 \u0027Maybe not today,\u0027 she laughed. Harry pointed to a group of around 30 people who had waded into the sea from the beach to get a better view of them: \u0027If we try and swim, I think they might be a bit of a hazard.\u0027 Showing they\u0027re not afraid to get their hands dirty, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will help local schoolchildren pick up litter from South Melbourne beach.Changing into a pair of  Rothy\u0027s flats and a matching black Miguellina Dress, Meghan and her husband made their way onto Melbourne\u0027s iconic mode of transport, along with student leaders at a local school. Arriving at the beach, the couple were fortunate to be greeted not only by roaring crowds, but also a bit of sunshine. Earlier, despite the royal couple arriving 20 minutes late for their first engagement of the day, the crowd of around 5,000 showed no sign of dampening their enthusiasm, gripped by \u0027Meg-Mania\u0027.           Harry and Meghan wave to the well-wishers after taking a ride on a tram in Melbourne          On the way to the beach Meghan smiled and showed Harry a little stuffed toy as the rode the tram in Melbourne          The couple took Melbourne\u0027s iconic tram system to the beach, catching it with student leaders at a local school          After lunch, the Duke and Duchess made a quick wardrobe change, the latter changing from heels to flats          Prince Harry also changed from the navy suit which originally matched his wife\u0027s outfit into a grey jacket and black trousers          The couple were also treated to lunch at Fitzroy\u0027s Charcoal Lane, which offers Aboriginal youths employment          Crushing a leaf of Strawberry Gum, a type of eucalyptus, the chef encouraged the royal visitors to smell it. \u0027Is that what Koalas eat in the Bush?\u0027 asked the Duke.          Among other plants, Harry bites into some eucalyptus, but not before he had to ask: \u0027Isn\u0027t that what koalas eat?\u0027    Executive Chef Greg Hampton (right) told the royal couple how they provide opportunity to young Aboriginal people  Harry tried plants and was also served Kangaroo and barracuda as a series of Aussie delicacies were prepared and Meghan had a good sniff of some ingredients          The couple departed Government House, visiting an Aboriginal artwork mural on Fitzroy restaurant Charcoal Lane    Prince Harry has cheekily mocked a young girl (pictured) who put a hand on her hips and refused to take a photograph with the royalPrince Harry has cheekily mocked a camera-shy young girl who refused to pose for a photograph with the visiting royal.While thousands of fans have clamoured for a piece of the Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle, this toddler in Dubbo had other ideas.She placed her left hand on her hip and stubbornly refused to move forward and say hello to a bemused prince.He in turn placed his hands on his hips to playfully mimic the young girl before bending down to give her a hug.The girl\u0027s parents were heard in the background giggling at their daughter\u0027s behaviour during the meet-and-greet in Dubbo on Wednesday before pushing her slightly forward to chat to the prince.                                                     But Meghan and Harry appeared completely at ease as they took a tram to the beach with a group of excited schoolchildren.While the journey lasted less than five minutes, the youngsters managed to get in some pressing questions. Ella Burns, a 12-year-old pupil from Albert Park primary school added: \u0027She said that she hadn\u0027t thought of one as it was still quite early.\u0027Meghan was also asked by Ella what she liked doing in her spare time.The Duchess replied that she \u0027didn\u0027t have much spare time\u0027 but when she does, she enjoys \u0027relaxing and watching TV shows.\u0027She faltered when asked what her favourite show was, and replied: \u0027There\u0027s heaps, I can\u0027t think of a specific one.\u0027 Meanwhile Lola Marinis, 12, from Middlepark Primary School, sat near Harry.He asked what job she wanted to do, and she replied that she wanted to be a teacher.Harry told her, \u0027There is always going to be one bad teacher that you remember, we need more good teachers.\u0027The Duchess of Sussex has been given plenty of flowers since she arrived in Australia. But today she was given her first tiara.It was presented by six year old Annie, a pupil at Albert Park primary school in Melbourne.Annie was one of 600 cheering children who greeted the duke and duchess as they came to see how the school is cutting waste and growing vegetables as part of a sustainability programme.Harry spotted Annie, who was holding a bunch of flowers as well as a toy tiara, and knelt down and said: \u0027Lily of the valley - is that right?\u0027Then, gesturing to Meghan, he said: \u0027Are they for her?\u0027The duchess, who was wearing a dress by Club Monaco, came over and said: \u0027Oh my goodness, thank you. Those are amazing!\u0027The couple met the school\u0027s \u0027waste warriors\u0027, dressed up in cape and masks, and met some sustainability leaders who showed them their \u0027nude food\u0027 lunch boxes, without any plastic wrapping.At the school wormery the duke was invited to name their pet snail. \u0027Speedy?\u0027 he suggested.At the vegetable patch, which included marigolds, peas, lettuce and alfalfa, Emma Cafferkey and Finn McClenaghan, both 12, showed them how to mulch. \u0027The mulch is made out of sugar that has been shredded. You have to remember with the mulch not to put it on top of the plants.\u0027After they left he said: \u0027They said we were very well educated and that we knew a lot about this kind of stuff.\u0027As they left, one little boy told Harry: \u0027You remind me of my uncle.\u0027The duke replied: \u0027Is that a good thing? Is it because I\u0027ve got a ginger beard?\u0027           Meghan and Harru spent time in the gardens of Govrenment House today where they met dignitaries and even an Aussie Rules star          The the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are a tactile couple and were often seen holding hands or giving eachothr a supportive rub this time at the Royal Botanic Gardens  Harry and Meghan having fun as they visit projects that align with their goals on the tour including encouraging women to take part in sport          The Duchess concentrated as she passes an Australian Rules football during an event at Government House          Meghan has said she is \u0027tired\u0027 but having a fantastic time on their 16-day tour with 76 different functions in four different countriesFoodie Meghan was in her element as she and Harry enjoyed a taste of Australia at Charcoal Lane, a social enterprise restaurant in Melbourne\u0027s trendy Fitzroy suburb.At a private lunch, the royal couple enjoyed a shared entree of mushroom and quinoa nest and chargrilled kangaroo and main courses of wild boar, saffron risotto and barramundi.          Meghan laughed a great deal during a reception where they met young ambassadors in Victoria and played games with themIt was prepared by young chefs being trained by the Mission Australia programme, which assists young indigenous Australians into employment, in many cases giving them a fresh start in life.Before the meal, they visited the kitchen, where Executive Chef Greg Hampton told the Duke and Duchess: \u0027Welcome, we are so happy to have you here.\u0027Gesturing at the sparkling surfaces, Harry said: \u0027You\u0027ve got a very clean kitchen – is it always this clean? Especially clean today?\u0027Meghan slipped off her Martin Grant trench coat in the warm room before Greg talked the couple through an array of unusual herbs and aromatic spices, getting them to smell and taste them.\u0027A lot of these ingredients have been here for thousands of years. Our fruits are the same as fruits thousands of years ago,\u0027 he explained.Showing them a finger lime, he squeezed out the fleshy contents, explaining: \u0027It comes out like caviar.\u0027\u0027Oh my goodness, that\u0027s incredible,\u0027 said the Duchess.But he warned the couple that the Tasmanian Pepper came with a kick, adding: \u0027I don\u0027t want to freak you out!\u0027Speaking ahead of their arrival, he had said: \u0027I would hesitate to offer her (the pregnant Duchess) the pepper, because they are quite hot.\u0027The first time I tasted one I thought I was having an allergic reaction because the heat creeps up on you. I don\u0027t want to freak her out.\u0027Crushing a leaf of Strawberry Gum, a type of Eucalyptus, he encouraged the royal visitors to smell it.\u0027Is that what Koalas eat in the Bush?\u0027 asked the Duke.\u0027Yes, but we can\u0027t eat it in the same way,\u0027 replied Greg, explaining how oils from the plant are used to flavour marinades, fish dishes and even ice cream.The couple were presented with Charcoal Lane aprons for the \u0027touch, taste and smell\u0027 experience, but did not wear them.Speaking ahead of the royal visit, Greg said: \u0027We are here to support young Aboriginal people into the workforce, with a view that when they leave this place, there is going to be long-term employment for them,\u0027 he said.\u0027I\u0027m not going to turn everyone that comes here into a chef, but if they leave here with a work ethic, it\u0027s a win for us.\u0027           Governor of Victoria Linda Dessau and her husband Anthony Howard at a reception given by the Governor of Victoria, at Government House during their visit to Melbourne          The expressive couple smile and laughed throughout the day today as they were mobbed by supporters wishing them well          The crowd of about 5,000 showed no sign of dampening their enthusiasm for the pair, despite being slightly behind schedule          Thousands of royal fans gathered at the Royal Botanic Gardens to take photos and meet the royal couple as they arrived          Harry tenderly holds his wife\u0027s hand behind his back as they enter Government House in Melbourne today    Harry and Meghan went Government House, where they were greeted by Governor Linda Dessau          At a private lunch, the royal couple enjoyed a shared entree of mushroom and quinoa nest and chargrilled kangaroo and main courses of wild boar, saffron risotto and barramundi          Meghan looks adoringly at her husband at a reception held in their honour today as their tour hit day 3           The Duke and Duchess of Sussex raced model Formula 1 cars inside Government House, meeting with young leaders          Duchess Meghan was seen patting a guide dog in the reception of Government HouseCharcoal Lane currently employs 23 young people for 15 hours a week as they work towards a Certificate 2 in hospitality.\u0027A lot of them come from backgrounds where nobody has worked, so this is very important for them,\u0027 said Greg.Programme Manager Troy Crellin said that in 10 years, the organisation had helped some 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders into work.The Duke and Duchess\u0027s visit to the restaurant began after they admired a mural outside created by Gunnai and Waradgerie man Robert Young to honour the building and the area\u0027s indigenous heritage.He told Harry and Meghan how his Celebration Dreaming artwork references Aboriginal identity, connections and culture in inner Melbourne Fitzroy.Before heading into the kitchen, they received a Welcome to Country delivered by Wurundjeri Elder Uncle Colin Hunter.Mission Australia CEO, James Toomey said: \u0027It was such a fantastic and humbling surprise to hear that Mission Australia\u0027s restaurant, Charcoal Lane was chosen to welcome The Duke and Duchess for a tour, hands-on cooking session and lunch. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the students to meet Their Royal Highnesses. Not too many young people can say they\u0027ve met and served royalty\u0027.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were introduced to some of Melrbourne\u0027s brightest and most innovative young people at a reception hosted by the Governor of Victoria, their first event of the day.The couple arrived at Government House for a Young Victorians Leaders reception approximately 25 minutes late after being stuck in traffic earlier that morning. But Harry and Meghan got straight to work when they were greeted by the Governor of Victoria, Linda Dessau, and her husband Anthony QC, who took them inside for a private meeting.Ten minutes later the couple re-emerged and were escorted across Government House\u0027s West where they were able to see a display put on by Victoria\u0027s This Girl Can empowerment campaign, which encourages everyday women to get active however, wherever and whenever they want without being judged.The couple were presented with a display of 150 women showcasing a number of activities, including netball, yoga, boxercise, cricket, cycling and Zumba.Meghan appeared to enjoy the fitness display, which was accompanied by high-energy soundtrack by DJ Yo Mafia, and was even convinced to throw an Australian Football League gameball. \u0027I\u0027m not sure I will be good,\u0027 she nervously laughed as she delicately threw the ball to one of the women. \u0027I\u0027m not sure I did it right!\u0027Jerril Rechter, CEO of VicHealth who showed the duchess around the event, said: \u0027She was really impressed by the ersity of activity we had here today, and especially the sense of camaraderie between the women.\u0027She did pass an AFL football. She did a handball. That\u0027s a pretty incredible thing for anybody to do.\u0027She had not seen an AFL football before Howard, the governor\u0027s husband, explained to her what it was like - the weight of it is a little bit different, and that you handball it, you don\u0027t pass it.\u0027Sabrin Nyawela, 20, a student teacher and This Girl Can ambassador originally from South Sudan, also spoke to the duchess.\u0027She was talking about how she loved the whole vibe of This Girl Can. She enjoyed being around women who want to make a change.\u0027She described her as a \u0027role model\u0027 and added: \u0027She was really engaged.

She said flattery and criticism run through the same filter. She said it was very freeing that she no longer has social media.\u0027Meghan, who is expecting her first baby with Prince Harry in the Spring of 2019, also told royal fans who gathered to catch a glimpse of the popular couple on Bondi Beach in Sydney on Thursday how she\u0027s relying on yoga to boost her energy levels. The Duchess, 37, admitted she\u0027d been awake at 4.30am that morning practising in an effort to combat her tiredness, as she and Harry joined an \u0027anti bad vibes\u0027 circle on Australia\u0027s most iconic beach with members of a local surfing community group.    The royal\u0027s mother Doria Ragland is a yoga instructor, and fitness fan Meghan - who was frequently snapped out and about with her yoga mat in the days before she joined The Firm - has previously described the practice as being \u0027in her blood\u0027.Charlotte Connell, 35, who is 23 weeks pregnant, and is the mother of Finn, two, said: \u0027Meghan told me that pregnancy was like having jet lag. She said she was up up at 4.30am this morning doing yoga in her room as she couldn\u0027t sleep. \u0027It’s a bit of a double whammy for her, she said, as she has both the baby and the jet lag to content with.Barefoot on Bondi: Meghan cradles her baby bump on Sydney...The PERFECT royal parents-in-waiting!

You have an intention set to really do something to change the world, and you have to keep it up. \u0027It makes me so emotional. You\u0027re doing really, really good work and I\u0027m so happy that we\u0027re here. We give you our full support.\u0027 The couple\u0027s \u0027surprise\u0027 appearance at the school on Friday turned out to be the worst-kept secret on campus.As Gladys Berejiklian, the Premier of New South Wales, teased them about being overexcited to see her, the teenagers fizzed with anticipation until the Duke and Duchess were finally introduced. Then, cheers and excited screams filled the air as they walked outside to meet the well-behaved girls, who had been sitting neatly for assembly. Invited to sit on a park bench in the centre, the couple watched a ballet-inspired dance performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027 before heading inside for the workshops.           The program aims to unite young people from erse communities to be \u0027advocates for positive change in their communities\u0027          Invited to sit on a park bench, the couple watched a ballet-inspired performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027The couple earlier went to Bondi Beach, one of Australia\u0027s most famous landmarks, to meet a local community surfing group known as One Wave.It was founded by Grant Trebilco who suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them.He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.When he came out, he said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He has now created \u0027Fluro Fridays\u0027 where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. Harry and Meghan, who was wearing a sleeveless Martin Grant dress with espadrille tie wedges, were both given brightly-coloured \u0027leis\u0027 - garlands of flowers - to put round their necks in order to enter into the spirit of things.Accompanied by Trebilco, they kicked off their shoes on the edge of the beach and walked barefoot to sit in a group with some of the colourfully-dressed surfers.          Among others, Meghan spoke to fellow expectant mother Charlotte, who is pictured with her two-year-old son Finn          Meghan shared with a group of yoga performers she does yoga to stay grounded, while Harry prefers to talk openly          Harry revealed her prefers informal chats about mental illness, hoping to reduce the stigma around them          The  couple met with members of a local surfing community called One Wave, which aims to raise awareness for mental health          The community group One Wave aims to raise awareness of mental health and wellbeing, saying it\u0027s a strength to ask for help    The couple spent around ten minutes listening to the experiences of other members of the group and sharing their own           Meghan told them yoga helps ground her and that she tries to find the time to make it part of her daily routine          One Wave founder Grant Trebilco said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health will help people across the globeTrebilco, 37, of Bondi, said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health would help people around the world.\u0027To have the Duke and Duchess down at Fluro Friday helped make mental health visible around the world,\u0027 he said.\u0027And it let people know that mental health doesn\u0027t descriminate.\u0027One thing that really stood out for me was that Prince Harry said asking for help is not a sign of weakness.\u0027It\u0027s a sign of strength.\u0027Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health\u0027It reduces that barrier.\u0027Those bright colours show we can make it visible and we don\u0027t have to go through it alone.\u0027    The couple donned floral leis as they met surfing and yoga members of the community          Members of the sharing group said the royal couple were relatable, open and honestDabriella Quayle, 37, said afterwards: ‘Oh my goodness, they were just so real, so relatable. They shared their own experiences, which was amazing.\u0027Harry said seeking help was the best thing he had ever done. He was really open and honest. He said it doesn\u0027t matter who you open up to, they don\u0027t have to be professional. Anyone can be there for you. It could be your best mate or a stranger. You just need to open up to them.\u0027She added: \u0027They talked about the strangeness of their own situation and the lives they lead but that at the end of the day they are just real people. They are just human beings.\u0027They said they were just like us in that people say lots of positive things to you and then they say one negative thing, and that\u0027s what gets you down.\u0027Meghan said how she did yoga at 4.30 this morning because of the jet lag. She says she is feeling OK, not too bad. They said they hadn\u0027t really had time to settle down and get their heads round thing, and they have another 70 odd engagements to go.\u0027          One member of One Wave said Meghan had a \u0027double whammy\u0027 of jet lag due to her pregnancy          Meghan revealed she had been up at 4.30am that morning practicing yoga when she couldn\u0027t get back to sleep           Meghan said yoga was her \u0027leveller\u0027, with the couple still having another 70 odd engagements to goAfter the circle the royals walked over to a group practising yoga. Nio Poniatowski, 25, said: \u0027Meghan said it was her leveller, it\u0027s what keeps her grounded, like surfing does for us. She said it was her escape.\u0027Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go.Surf instructor Sam Schumacher, 31, said the couple both revealed they had surfed, adding: \u0027The circle time was great. Two or three of us shared our personal stories.\u0027This visit will really raise the profile of what we are trying to do and the fact that mental health doesn\u0027t discriminate. \u0027It can affect anyone and that we all need to try and look after each other. \u0027I can see the passion in their eyes.\u0027Trebilco said the couple had been \u0027so nice, so friendly\u0027.          One member of the circle said he could \u0027see the passion\u0027 for awareness of mental health in the couples\u0027 eyes          Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go          The royal couple pictured with garlands of flowers, or \u0027leis\u0027, dangling around their necks as they walk through the sand          Thousands of well-wishers came out to Sydney\u0027s iconic Bondi Beach to see the royal couple on Friday morningStuart Klees, 34, of Bondi, said: \u0027Harry shared his views on mental health towards everyone.\u0027\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in normalising the conversation around mental health.\u0027He feels fortunate that he\u0027s in a position to get the right people together to spread that message.\u0027He\u0027s a big supporter of small community groups like One Wave.\u0027Prince Harry talked to the group about his own issues with mental health.\u0027He said he\u0027s seen a couple of counsellors before and never found one that suits him,\u0027 Klees said.\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in having normal conversations with normal people.\u0027He was pretty genuine, real honest, real open, real relaxed.\u0027He wasn\u0027t trying to put on a show. He was really genuine in the way he came across.\u0027As she left, Meghan told the group that she was \u0027loving\u0027 her first experience of Australia. \u0027It is so great to be here,\u0027 she said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/20/04/517792C300000578-0-image-m-34_1540006589245.jpg","title":"Karlie Kloss Joshua Kushner married","story":"Say \u0026#39I do\u0026#39 in a beautiful Dior wedding dress like KarlieGet the look belowSupermodel Karlie Kloss revealed on Instagram that she\u0026#39s tied the knot with her beau Joshua Kushner!The beautiful bride chose a stunning wedding gown by Dior, featuring a fitted bodice with long-sleeved lace overlay and a full skirt.

I love the smoky, sophisticated atmosphere of the image. This feels very right for now — escapist and sensual... You can start a whole script just by staring into her eyes.\u0027Their collaboration didn\u0027t stop there, and Kloss remained Galliano\u0027s muse until he was fired in 2011 following an anti-Semitic rant that was caught on tape Kloss has also said that a Dior bag gifted to her by Galliano is her dearest possession.\u0027He gave it to me after we shot my first campaign with Steven Meisel, and I cried when I opened it. It is the most beautiful, timeless Dior bag. It is such a special reminder of that time in my career someday I will give it to my daughter,\u0027 she told Vogue in 2012.The two have not worked together of recent, and it was the house’s current designer who made the dress Kloss wore in perhaps her last piece for the brand.Maria Grazia Churi announced earlier this year that she will leave Dior, where she became creative director two years ago after a successful stint at Valentino. Kloss took her mom with her to Paris for the final fitting of that dress, which occured during fashion week.           Family: Joshua, who is a \u0027lifelong Democrat,\u0027 is the younger brother of White House senior adviser Jared Kusnher, who is married to first daughter Ivanka Trump (pictured in 2013)          Siblings-in-law: Karlie and Joshua have not made a public appearance together with Jared and Ivanka.

and her new husband do not share the same political views as Ivanka and Jared.And Kloss, like Ivanka, is reported to have converted to Judaism ahead of the ceremony.Ivanka is particularly close with Josh as he manages her trust while she works for her father in the White House.That trust, which was revealed to be worth approximately $50million in White House documents released last year, is controlled by not only Josh but also Ivanka’s sister-in-law Nicole Meyer. Jared\u0027s brother Josh and sister Nicole may in fact be family, and as a result more accessible to Ivanka, but there is no question that the two were a logical choice to manage a trust.Josh is the owner of the venture capital firm Thrive, who were one of the first to invest in Instagram.He attended undergrad at Harvard, like his brother Jared, and stayed in Cambridge to attend business school at the Ivy League university as well, graduating in 2011.The real estate scion, who was raised in New Jersey, took a job at Goldman Sachs after school before heading off on his own with Thrive.Thrive closed its fifth fund in 2016 for $700 million, pushing the total amount managed by the group at the time to approximately $1.3 billion.He is also the co-founder of Oscar Health and was a Hillary Clinton supporter in the election.Nicole is a principal at Kushner properties (as is Josh) and her husband Joseph is the chief executive of Observer Media.There is a fourth Kushner sibling, Dara, who lives with her family in New Jersey near the home where she grew up with her brother

It\u0027s made you confident, well-spoken. You have an intention set to really do something to change the world, and you have to keep it up.\u0027It makes me so emotional. You\u0027re doing really, really good work and I\u0027m so happy that we\u0027re here. We give you our full support.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t stop,\u0027 the Prince reiterated. \u0027Get more people involved, guys as well.\u0027 Teachers explained that the girls have been taking an \u0027integrated course\u0027 on top of their usual studies, to give them \u002721st century capabilities\u0027 including creativity and critical thinking, with \u0027a core focus on making a change in local communities\u0027. One project saw them make boxes of supplies to donate to vulnerable women via police stations and refuge centres, while in another they created notebooks to pass forward for students to write about the women who have inspired them. Coincidentally, one pupil had written about the Duchess long before the royal visit had been announced.

It give you a good work ethic, right?\u0027 She joined groups of students from across different schools in Sydney who have been introduced via the programme, which teaches them: \u0027Everybody belongs.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s so important,\u0027 said the Duchess. \u0027All these people you know of in your neighbourhood, now you know them and you\u0027re united. You\u0027re proud of where you\u0027re from, you can champion where you\u0027re from and make people see it for what it is.\u0027 Harry, sitting with a second group of youngsters, joked that he was \u0027clinging onto my youth at the age of 34,\u0027 said he now looked to the younger generation for inspiration. \u0027We\u0027re so lucky that wherever we go in the world, we\u0027re finding young people like you guys,\u0027 he said. \u0027This sweeping wave of kindness and optimism and empathy that\u0027s seems to be lacking in some of the previous generation.

He said it doesn\u0027t matter who you open up to, they don\u0027t have to be professional. \u0027Anyone can be there for you. It could be your best mate or a stranger.

Harry said asking for help was not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength. We need to talk about this stuff. No matter what you are going through you don\u0027t have to do it alone,\u0027 he said.\u0027Meghan shared how yoga is her escape, she does yoga daily and how her mum is a yoga instructor. Harry talked about how everyone has their different recipe and how much sports can help with your mental health.\u0027He said he and Meghan had surfed before. We tried to get him in and told him we had a wet suit and surf board ready for him, but he said he couldn\u0027t. They were so engaging, they had time for everyone and really felt part of the One Wave community.\u0027 Mr Trebilco suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them. He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.He said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He then created Fluro Fridays - where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. British man and Nazi pilot seems to share similar facial featuresPrince Harry and Meghan board a boat to Cockatoo IslandPrince Harry and Meghan open ANZAC Memorial at Sydney\u0027s Hyde ParkPrince Harry and Meghan Markle meet with crowds gathered at BondiTeenager was disowned by his mother for giant facial tumourNick Clegg excited for \u0027new adventure\u0027 after news of Facebook jobPrince Harry and Meghan Markle return to Admiralty HouseSHOCKING moment pensioner is viciously attacked in BirminghamMoment backpacker sprays \u0027Scouse Lee\u0027 on 800-year-old Thai fortressMoment youth pulls knife in South London street altercation    The royal couple also met and shared jokes with local lifeguards (left), made famous by television series Bondi Rescue          Prince Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan are pictured meeting a young child during their Bondi Beach visit on Friday  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are on their official 16-day Autumn tour visiting cities in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand          Meghan is seen preparing to take part in OneWave\u0027s mental health awareness session on the sand at the world-famous beach          Meghan is seen laughing as she mingled with locals on Friday morning. She and Harry spent about half an hour on the sand\u0027To have the duke and duchess down at Flouro Friday helped make mental health visible around the world,\u0027 Mr Trebilco said.\u0027One thing that really stood out for me was that Prince Harry said asking for help is not a sign of weakness. It\u0027s a sign of strength. Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health. It reduces that barrier. Those bright colours show we can make it visible and we don\u0027t have to go through it alone.\u0027 Bondi local Charlie Adams is happy the royal couple are using their influence to shine a spotlight on mental illness and OneWave.\u0027I think there is still a lot of stigma around mental health and it\u0027s great that Harry and Meghan are addressing that here today,\u0027 Mr Adams said. British man and Nazi pilot seems to share similar facial featuresPrince Harry and Meghan board a boat to Cockatoo IslandPrince Harry and Meghan open ANZAC Memorial at Sydney\u0027s Hyde ParkPrince Harry and Meghan Markle meet with crowds gathered at BondiTeenager was disowned by his mother for giant facial tumourNick Clegg excited for \u0027new adventure\u0027 after news of Facebook jobPrince Harry and Meghan Markle return to Admiralty HouseSHOCKING moment pensioner is viciously attacked in BirminghamMoment backpacker sprays \u0027Scouse Lee\u0027 on 800-year-old Thai fortressMoment youth pulls knife in South London street altercation    Harry and Meghan are pictured chatting with OneWave members, while a small child gazes adoringly at the prince           Meghan appears to clean sand from her husband\u0027s ear as they take part in OneWave\u0027s Fluro Friday session on Friday morning  The purpose of Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s visit will later come back into focus, with the prince officially marking the arrival of the Invictus Games in the Harbour City          Britain\u0027s Duchess of Sussex hugs a participant of Fluro Friday, an event organised by surfing community OneWave tackling mental health issues          Harry is seen pointing to the north while his beaming wife flashes a smile as they speak with members of a local surfing group          Meghan is seen shaking hands with Bondi Beach head lifeguard Bruce \u0027Hoppo\u0027 Hopkins on Friday morning Meanwhile, Jacob Andrews, 12, has met some of the world\u0027s biggest pop stars - from Justin Bieber to Selena Gomez and Rihanna - but as far as he\u0027s concerned, none match the celebrity status of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Friday was the second time Jacob had met Prince Harry, following an encounter at Circular Quay when he was seven.This time in Bondi, Jacob didn\u0027t get a selfie with the young royal - but Meghan took a copy of a picture he had taken with her husband the first time they met.\u0027I was nervous,\u0027 Jacob said of the wait at Bondi Beach. \u0027Mum was nervous.

It is sold through smaller, low-end cafes and pubs.Congalsa’s international sales manager, Juan Prieto Canamero, said: ‘The squid fishing crisis has meant processors needed to make pre-formed products instead.

Physical activity like yoga and surfing is so good for healing your mind.\u0027 As a TV star based in Toronto presiding over her own lifestyle website, The Tig, then actress Meghan frequently updated her fans on her favourite workouts - revealing she was a fan of Pilates Platinum, the megaformer method founded by her close friend, pilates instructor Heather Dorak. Her remarks today made clear she intends to keep working out through pregnancy. Kensington Palace confirmed the Duke and Duchess\u0027 happy news in a statement on Monday, just hours after they touched down in Australia at the start of their first major overseas tour.The popular couple have been greeted by cheering crowds at all of their engagements to date, including a trip to Bondi Beach on Friday morning where Harry and Meghan joined a circle of colourfully dressed surfers to discuss the importance of being open about mental health battles.  The couple spent around ten minutes listening to the experiences of other members of the group and sharing their own, laughing and putting their arms around each other.           The royal couple visited Macarthur High School on the afternoon of the fourth day of their Australian tour          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle spoke to the high school students about striving for female empowerment          The royals\u0027 attendance to the school was the worst kept secret in town, with students anxiously awaiting their arrival          They were shown student projects, including one where students made boxes of supplies to donate to vulnerable women          Meghan was sympathetic when a student told her about their part-time job, reminiscing on her own first job          The Duke and Duchess were introduced to teenage boys and girls from the In League In Harmony project from the NRL          \u0027All these people you know of in your neighbourhood, now you know them and you\u0027re united,\u0027 the Duchess told studentsThey also visited Macarthur Girls High School on the fourth day of their visit to Australia and spoke to teenagers about equality, with the Duchess - who has even put her \u0027feminist manifesto\u0027 on the Buckingham Palace website - saying she felt \u0027emotional\u0027 hearing their passionate views.Harry, who is now said to identify as a feminist, told the girls he wants men to add their voices to the fight for equality. \u0027Men can help as well by getting involved, we have to,\u0027 he said. \u0027We need to get men\u0027s voices involved as soon as possible.\u0027 His wife, who has been a long-term advocate for women\u0027s rights, told students that their projects, including making boxes of supplies for women in need, made her proud.\u0027You guys all remind me so much of myself when I was growing up,\u0027 she told 14-year-old girls. \u0027I went to an all girls school which was incredibly erse as well. \u0027I think being around such empowered young women, it becomes something that you all just grasp onto to understand your world. \u0027It\u0027s made you confident, well-spoken. You have an intention set to really do something to change the world, and you have to keep it up. \u0027It makes me so emotional. You\u0027re doing really, really good work and I\u0027m so happy that we\u0027re here. We give you our full support.\u0027 The couple\u0027s \u0027surprise\u0027 appearance at the school on Friday turned out to be the worst-kept secret on campus.As Gladys Berejiklian, the Premier of New South Wales, teased them about being overexcited to see her, the teenagers fizzed with anticipation until the Duke and Duchess were finally introduced. Then, cheers and excited screams filled the air as they walked outside to meet the well-behaved girls, who had been sitting neatly for assembly. Invited to sit on a park bench in the centre, the couple watched a ballet-inspired dance performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027 before heading inside for the workshops.           The program aims to unite young people from erse communities to be \u0027advocates for positive change in their communities\u0027          Invited to sit on a park bench, the couple watched a ballet-inspired performance from students to the song \u0027Power of Love\u0027The couple earlier went to Bondi Beach, one of Australia\u0027s most famous landmarks, to meet a local community surfing group known as One Wave.It was founded by Grant Trebilco who suffered from mental health issues for a decade but felt unable to talk about them.He was eventually diagnosed as being bi-polar and hospitalised.When he came out, he said surfing was \u0027his saviour\u0027 and he finally felt able to open up to his closest friends, who were incredibly sympathetic to him and also shared issues of their own.He has now created \u0027Fluro Fridays\u0027 where people dress up in fluorescent clothes and go to the beach, with the aim of fostering an atmosphere where others can open up about their own mental health issues. Harry and Meghan, who was wearing a sleeveless Martin Grant dress with espadrille tie wedges, were both given brightly-coloured \u0027leis\u0027 - garlands of flowers - to put round their necks in order to enter into the spirit of things.Accompanied by Trebilco, they kicked off their shoes on the edge of the beach and walked barefoot to sit in a group with some of the colourfully-dressed surfers.          Among others, Meghan spoke to fellow expectant mother Charlotte, who is pictured with her two-year-old son Finn          Meghan shared with a group of yoga performers she does yoga to stay grounded, while Harry prefers to talk openly          Harry revealed her prefers informal chats about mental illness, hoping to reduce the stigma around them          The  couple met with members of a local surfing community called One Wave, which aims to raise awareness for mental health          The community group One Wave aims to raise awareness of mental health and wellbeing, saying it\u0027s a strength to ask for help    The couple spent around ten minutes listening to the experiences of other members of the group and sharing their own           Meghan told them yoga helps ground her and that she tries to find the time to make it part of her daily routine          One Wave founder Grant Trebilco said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health will help people across the globeTrebilco, 37, of Bondi, said the couple\u0027s openness about mental health would help people around the world.\u0027To have the Duke and Duchess down at Fluro Friday helped make mental health visible around the world,\u0027 he said.\u0027And it let people know that mental health doesn\u0027t descriminate.\u0027One thing that really stood out for me was that Prince Harry said asking for help is not a sign of weakness.\u0027It\u0027s a sign of strength.\u0027Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health\u0027It reduces that barrier.\u0027Those bright colours show we can make it visible and we don\u0027t have to go through it alone.\u0027    The couple donned floral leis as they met surfing and yoga members of the community          Members of the sharing group said the royal couple were relatable, open and honestDabriella Quayle, 37, said afterwards: ‘Oh my goodness, they were just so real, so relatable. They shared their own experiences, which was amazing.\u0027Harry said seeking help was the best thing he had ever done. He was really open and honest. He said it doesn\u0027t matter who you open up to, they don\u0027t have to be professional. Anyone can be there for you. It could be your best mate or a stranger. You just need to open up to them.\u0027She added: \u0027They talked about the strangeness of their own situation and the lives they lead but that at the end of the day they are just real people. They are just human beings.\u0027They said they were just like us in that people say lots of positive things to you and then they say one negative thing, and that\u0027s what gets you down.\u0027Meghan said how she did yoga at 4.30 this morning because of the jet lag. She says she is feeling OK, not too bad. They said they hadn\u0027t really had time to settle down and get their heads round thing, and they have another 70 odd engagements to go.\u0027          One member of One Wave said Meghan had a \u0027double whammy\u0027 of jet lag due to her pregnancy          Meghan revealed she had been up at 4.30am that morning practicing yoga when she couldn\u0027t get back to sleep           Meghan said yoga was her \u0027leveller\u0027, with the couple still having another 70 odd engagements to goAfter the circle the royals walked over to a group practising yoga. Nio Poniatowski, 25, said: \u0027Meghan said it was her leveller, it\u0027s what keeps her grounded, like surfing does for us. She said it was her escape.\u0027Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go.Surf instructor Sam Schumacher, 31, said the couple both revealed they had surfed, adding: \u0027The circle time was great. Two or three of us shared our personal stories.\u0027This visit will really raise the profile of what we are trying to do and the fact that mental health doesn\u0027t discriminate. \u0027It can affect anyone and that we all need to try and look after each other. \u0027I can see the passion in their eyes.\u0027Trebilco said the couple had been \u0027so nice, so friendly\u0027.          One member of the circle said he could \u0027see the passion\u0027 for awareness of mental health in the couples\u0027 eyes          Chatting with another group of surfers, Harry said he had never waxed a board before, so he and Meghan both had a go          The royal couple pictured with garlands of flowers, or \u0027leis\u0027, dangling around their necks as they walk through the sand          Thousands of well-wishers came out to Sydney\u0027s iconic Bondi Beach to see the royal couple on Friday morningStuart Klees, 34, of Bondi, said: \u0027Harry shared his views on mental health towards everyone.\u0027\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in normalising the conversation around mental health.\u0027He feels fortunate that he\u0027s in a position to get the right people together to spread that message.\u0027He\u0027s a big supporter of small community groups like One Wave.\u0027Prince Harry talked to the group about his own issues with mental health.\u0027He said he\u0027s seen a couple of counsellors before and never found one that suits him,\u0027 Klees said.\u0027He\u0027s a big believer in having normal conversations with normal people.\u0027He was pretty genuine, real honest, real open, real relaxed.\u0027He wasn\u0027t trying to put on a show. He was really genuine in the way he came across.\u0027As she left, Meghan told the group that she was \u0027loving\u0027 her first experience of Australia. \u0027It is so great to be here,\u0027 she said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/19/07/5170C1C000000578-6293371-image-a-90_1539932289944.jpg","title":"Prince Harry arrives climb Sydney Harbour Bridge","story":"    Prince Harry scaled the Sydney Harbour Bridge alongside Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison (second form left) and Invictus Games athletes (right) for one of the best views of the city          The group scaled the iconic bridge in quick time with former soldier Harry leading the charge of the 1,322 steps          The Duke of Sussex walks at the head of the group followed by Mr Morrison and the four Invictus Games competitors           In another shot just after they arrived, the Opera House and Sydney CBD is visible in the backgroundAlso participating in the climb is Gwen Cherne, whose late husband served in Cambodia, Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq. Meghan was originally tabbed to participate in the climb, but her name was mysteriously removed from the itinerary a month earlier.The reasoning wasn\u0027t clear until this past Monday, when it was announced she was pregnant.The Duke swapped his blazer and trousers for a short sleeved black shirt as he made quick pace up the bridge, swapping his position between up to a dozen others to chat to different climbing companions.However, he decided to forgo the goofy bright blue jumpsuit thousands of tourists have been photographed wearing as they smile at the arch’s summit.As luck would have it, the morning clouds and fog cleared up by the time he began his ascent about 3pm, treating him to an unblemished view as a flag advertising the Invictus Games flew next to the Australian flag.British man and Nazi pilot seems to share similar facial featuresPrince Harry and Meghan board a boat to Cockatoo IslandPrince Harry and Meghan open ANZAC Memorial at Sydney\u0027s Hyde ParkPrince Harry and Meghan Markle meet with crowds gathered at BondiTeenager was disowned by his mother for giant facial tumourNick Clegg excited for \u0027new adventure\u0027 after news of Facebook jobPrince Harry and Meghan Markle return to Admiralty HouseSHOCKING moment pensioner is viciously attacked in BirminghamMoment backpacker sprays \u0027Scouse Lee\u0027 on 800-year-old Thai fortressMoment youth pulls knife in South London street altercation    Prince Harry arrived at the Sydney Harbour Bridge for his afternoon climb of the 134-metre icon          The Duke of Sussex climbed the bridge alongside Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison while Meghan waited below          After stopping to admire the view, the group headed down the other side of the bridge after crossing the           Harry paused at the summit of the climb, pointing out landmarks across the city with his right arm          The pilgrimage, almost mandatory for any Sydney visitor, follows a comprehensive safety briefing with climbers hooked up to wires running up the steel structure throughout the climbWhen they made it to the top, Harry, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, and four others posed side-by-side for a memorable photo with the harbour and Opera House in the background.Mr Morrison appeared out of breath when the group reached the summit, but former military man Harry looked relaxed and unfazed by the arduous climb. \u0027The Sydney Harbour Bridge is an Australian icon and I can think of no better place to raise the Invictus Games Sydney 2018 flag,\u0027 Mr Morrison said earlier in the day.\u0027It will be especially wonderful for the Duke and me to share this moment with members of the Australian Team before they get ready to compete for Australia.\u0027          Harry climbed the iconic bridge with a party of up to a dozen, swapping his position between them to chat to different people during the ascent.

It\u0027s a sign of strength. Mental health is invisible. You can\u0027t see when people are struggling.\u0027Wearing the bright flouro helps start conversations that never usually happen around mental health. It reduces that barrier.

He has never travelled anywhere to fight and yet has been happy to see followers go abroad to wage jihad and die. \u0027He doesn\u0027t care about them. He is happy to radicalise vulnerable young men and send them to fight. But he is too scared to go. He is no martyr\u0027.           Neighbours are irate that Choudary is living next door to a primary in his bail hostel Choudary was to a probation hostel after serving half his sentence for swearing an oath of allegiance to Islamic State – despite security experts warning the \u0027Pied Piper of jihad\u0027 would inspire more terror attacks.However, he will be subject to a huge security operation, including surveillance teams, monitoring devices and demands that he adhere to up to 25 rules controlling his activities.          Anjem Choudary has been released from prison after serving just half his five-and-a-half year sentenceChoudary, 51, a married father of five, is one of Britain\u0027s most notorious firebrand clerics. He was jailed for five-and-a-half years for inviting support for ISIS, but was given automatic release after serving half his sentence. The judge who sent him to prison in 2016, Mr Justice Holroyde, said he would be dangerous in jail and on release.He told him at the Old Bailey: \u0027You show no remorse at all for anything you have said or done and I have no doubt you will continue to communicate your message whenever you can\u0027. His unpopular  release came as:■Campaigners said he remained \u0027Britain\u0027s most dangerous extremist\u0027 after research showed he is already linked to over 120 Islamist terrorists.■It was revealed that the huge security surrounding him is estimated to cost the taxpayer more than £2million a year - compared to the £50,000 to keep him in jail.■An imam who has met Choudary in jail suggested he had used human rights laws to be placed in a half-way house in North London – close to where he used to preach – by claiming he had to be near his children.The release is a landmark moment for the Government, which is still reeling from a string of atrocities which left more than 30 dead last year.          Hate preacher Anjem Choudary pictured in the 1990s as a student drinking with friends who are reading Mayfair magazineThe preacher, who once led banned group Al-Muhajiroun, was sentenced in 2016. Fiyaz Mughal, head of anti-extremist group Faith Matters, has spoken to the imam who was brought into jail to try to de-radicalise him.\u0027Choudary was put in containment that stops him engaging with other prisoners, but also given pastoral care to see if they could get through to him,\u0027 he said. \u0027I asked the guy who spoke to him if the de-radicalisation programme had worked and he said, \u0027No, he\u0027s got worse. He\u0027s hardened\u0027. He speaks in the mind-set of the victim. He sees himself as a martyr the state tried to silence.\u0027Choudary does not plan to directly challenge the conditions of his release, but instead is working out ways to get round them, Mr Mughal said.\u0027He\u0027s said things like, \u0027if someone wants to upload my videos I\u0027m not going to stop them\u0027.\u0027Mr Mughal added: \u0027He should have served the full term. It\u0027s a terrible day for victims of the attacks he has helped incite.\u0027We need a change in the law so that anyone named as the inciter in two terrorist attacks should automatically serve the full sentence.\u0027Dr Michael Kenney, of the University of Pittsburgh, who followed Al-Muhajiroun for five years for his research, said its followers were \u0027very excited\u0027 about his release.They had been dormant following his arrest, but are now expected to try to \u0027rebuild and revitalise\u0027, he said.And he warned it was \u0027entirely possible\u0027 that more of his followers would turn to terrorism, like Khuram Butt, who was part of last year\u0027s London Bridge terror attack and Lee Rigby killers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.Security expert Professor Anthony Glees, of Buckingham University, said: \u0027He is charismatic and a very gifted orator – he is the Pied Piper of Jihad.\u0027Those who are vulnerable to his warped messages will see him as a hero … who has been through the fire of imprisonment.\u0027Security sources say Choudary\u0027s conviction has raised his credibility among fanatics. In the past, his desire not to go to prison and, what was seen in some quarters as his cowardice by not going to Syria, raised suspicions that he was a stooge for the security services.      Hate preacher Anjem Choudary - who inspired some of Britain\u0027s most notorious terrorists - is to be released on Friday and moved to a bail hostel Campaign group Hope not Hate found he has been directly or indirectly linked to at least 123 Islamist terrorists.\u0027Anjem Choudary will remain the most dangerous extremist in Britain today,\u0027 said Nick Lowles, chief executive. \u0027This is a man who has inspired dozens to commit acts of violence.\u0027The security operation will include surveillance teams, monitoring devices and demands that Choudary adhere to up to 25 rules. He also faces being targeted by UN sanctions to freeze his assets, prevent him travelling and even enforce \u0027arms embargo provisions\u0027.Theresa May yesterday insisted safeguards were place to protect people from him.  Web of hate: How Anjem Choudary\u0027s sermons inspired a generation of home-grown terrorists and radicals The hate-filled circle around Anjem Choudary was a breeding ground for the Islamic extremism which plagued Britain in the last two decades.Former law-student Choudary, who previously called for adulterers to be stoned to death and branded UK troops \u0027cowards\u0027, always hid behind free speech rules whenever challenged by the authorities.But the group he helped to set up were linked to a series of terrorist attacks, as easily-influenced young men became inspired by his twisted vision of jihad.The best known of his disciples was Muslim convert Michael Adebolajo, who, along with Michael Adebowale, attacked Fusilier Lee Rigby with a meat cleaver in Woolwich in 2013 in a murder which shocked the country.            Anjem Choudary was at the centre of a web of extremists who operated in LondonAdebolajo was a supporter of Choudary\u0027s al-Muhajiroun group and was pictured standing behind the hate preacher in 2007.After the incident, Choudary said Adebolajo was \u0027a practising Muslim and a family man\u0027 who he was \u0027proud of\u0027.But he denied encouraging the killer to carry out the attack, insisting he was \u0027channeling the energy of the youth through demonstrations and processions\u0027.London Bridge attacker Khuram Butt  also joined one of Choudary\u0027s rallies, this time on College Green outside the Palace of Westminster in 2013.There, Butt \u0027verbally assaulted\u0027 a moderate Muslim leader who had opposed Choudary\u0027s extremist rhetoric.Meanwhile, Mohammed Reza Haque, thought of as Choudary\u0027s bodyguard, disappeared from Britain in 2014.  London Bridge attacker Kharum Butt (left) and Westminster attacker Khalid Masood (right)A photograph taken in Syria showed him in a balaclava and camouflage clothing, brandishing an AK-47 assault rifle and he has since been suspected as being a tall figure in ISIS\u0027s horrific execution films.Siddhartha Dhar, who once ran Choudary\u0027s media operation, was also seen posing in a military style coat and boots, brandishing an assault rifle and holding his new born baby in Syria, labelling the picture \u0027Generation Khilafah\u0027.In December 2014, two other close associates were discovered in the back of a lorry at Dover as they tried to leave the country.Westminster attacker Khalid Masood was also linked to Choudary through Ibrahim Anderson, an al-Muhajiroun activist  convicted of inviting support for ISIS in 2016.  Will this fanatic branded despicable by fellow Muslims spark a new terror wave, asks NEIL TWEEDIEHe laughs boorishly for the camera across a pub table crammed with half-drained pint glasses and cans of cider, while a friend sitting next to him flaunts a copy of a soft-porn magazine. As a young man – a failed medical student turned aspiring lawyer – Anjem Choudary liked porn, casual sex, booze and getting stoned.Now, at the age of 51, he prefers others to get stoned – but not on drugs. ‘For people who have had adultery committed against them, people who have had their wives taken, a lot will say: “I think stoning to death is appropriate”,’ he has said.Welcome to the warped, medieval world of Britain’s most virulent Islamist hate-preacher who, following his expected release from prison today, is back in circulation – albeit hemmed in by draconian restrictions on his freedom.Choudary, who was raised in Kent by Pakistani immigrant parents, is a man consumed with hatred for the liberal society that nurtured him, and a believer in the unforgiving rule of sharia law. In his universe, for every human weakness there is a brutally appropriate punishment, including crucifixion, and for every infidel a place in hellfire.            Hate preacher Anjem Choudary - who inspired some of Britain\u0027s most notorious terrorists - is to be released on Friday and moved to a bail hostel including Michael Adebolajo (left) who beheaded Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013This so-called cleric, who is not a recognised religious scholar, has inspired some of Britain’s most infamous Islamist terrorists, including Khuram Butt, leader of the London Bridge attacks in June last year, and Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, murderers of Fusilier Lee Rigby who was hacked to death in Woolwich in 2013.It is thought that more than 100 terrorists owe him some degree of allegiance, and many more acolytes have made their way to Syria to take part in jihad. Choudary, a qualified solicitor who used his skills to stay just the right side of the law during two decades of extolling extremism, was brought to justice after being caught expressing support for the banned terrorist sect Islamic State.Jailed for five and a half years at the Old Bailey in August 2016, he is now free on licence after serving half his sentence – to the frustration of those who understand the danger he represents.‘I would describe him as a hardened terrorist, somebody who has had huge influence on the Islamist extremist scene in this country over many years,’ says Richard Walton, a former head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command. ‘I believe we are under-estimating the potency and danger of the radicalisers who don’t carry knives, guns and overtly plot terrorist attacks but who pollute the minds of young Muslim men.’During a debate in the House of Lords on the Government’s proposed counter-terrorism and border security Bill this month, Lord Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said a quarter of jihadis convicted in Britain between 2001 and 2015 were ‘associated’ with Choudary, compared with a tenth linked to al-Qaeda and one in 20 connected to Islamic State.Describing Choudary as a ‘highly dangerous fanatical extremist’, prisons minister Rory Stewart has promised that he will be subject to round-the-clock surveillance.Under the terms of his early release, which cannot be prevented under current law, he will be housed in a probation hostel in London for six months, away from his family home in Ilford in the east of the city, and must remain within the area bounded by the M25 motorway.            There are fears Choudary, who previously mocked up a picture of Buckingham Palace as a mosque, could go back to radicalising young men after his release this weekHe will be electronically tagged, subject to a curfew, banned from preaching and attending certain mosques, allowed to associate only with ‘approved’ people and barred from using the internet. A single mobile phone is allowed – but subject to examination at any time. In addition, Choudary’s assets have been frozen, and he will be subject to strict limits on financial activity.MI5 and intelligence agency GCHQ will participate in the surveillance operation targeting the preacher, but pressure on resources makes continuous physical surveillance less likely. With 23,000 potential extremists at large, they have their hands full.Choudary spent most of his sentence at Frankland high-security prison in County Durham. It is one of three institutions in Britain equipped with a separation unit, a ‘prison-within-a-prison’ intended to isolate terrorists from ordinary inmates.            Choudary is barred from contacting partner-in-crime Mohammed Mizanur RahmanChoudary, whose release date takes into account time spent on curfew and remand before his trial, was allowed to associate only with a handful of similar prisoners, and subject to psychological and spiritual counselling involving an approved imam.Much good it did him – he is reported to be as extreme as ever and has been penning a book chronicling his ‘martyrdom’. ‘Choudary may not have coached suicide bombers directly,’ says David Videcette, a former counter-terrorism officer,’ but he is the calibre of person who would do such a thing. A person thinking of sacrificing his or herself for Allah, in Syria or elsewhere, will seek this man’s approval, and he has the contacts to make this ambition a reality.’Now he is expected to tread very carefully, giving the authorities no excuse to send him back to prison.‘He is aware of what the law allows him to say and what not to say, and he rarely steps over the line,’ adds Mr Videcette. ‘He knows how not to get himself into trouble – we were extremely lucky to find some material showing him promoting IS that allowed us to put him away. He remains a danger to anyone with whom he comes into contact – those who are vulnerable and impressionable.’Choudary studied medicine at Southampton University but failed his first-year exams and took up law. As an undergraduate, he was known as Andy, a ‘party animal’ who indulged his appetite for alcohol, cannabis and women.Estrangement from British society began with his failure to secure a job in a top law firm and he began to gravitate towards extremism, becoming a disciple of Syrian-born Islamist preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad. Together, the men founded al-Muhajiroun (ALM), a shadowy organisation promoting a hardline version of Islam.All the time, he and his equally radical wife, and their children, were sustained by benefits from the state they both profess to loathe – totalling some £20,000 a year in child benefit, housing benefit and tax credits.An incubator for terrorism, al-Muhajiroun was proscribed in 2010 but re-emerged under a series of new names such as Muslims Against Crusades. Bakri had left the UK in 2005, leaving Choudary as the guiding light of the Islamist movement here.A narcissist with a taste for the limelight, he was adept at courting media attention. In his vision of the future, the black flag of the caliphate will fly over Buckingham Palace and Downing Street, and the Queen will be forced to cover her face, he repeatedly told journalists. In 2010, he led a protest in the Wiltshire market town of Wootton Bassett, through which the coffins of British servicemen killed in action in Afghanistan were paraded and honoured after being flown in to nearby RAF Lyneham.‘Goading is part of his strategy,’ says Mr Videcette. ‘He wants to drive a wedge between the Muslim community and the secular community. Terrorism is about polarising views – Muslims are left alone by the main population and that allows extremists to thrive within that community.‘Choudary is one of the few public faces of Islamist extremism. There are not many people with his public persona, but several hundred who behind closed doors share his views. He is at the top of a hierarchical structure that at its base has about 20,000 people who are known to have contact with these hundreds of advisers.’As a young man, Adam Deen was seduced by the simplistic ‘Muslims against the rest’ message of ALM and joined the group. Now a director of the anti-extremist organisation Quilliam, he warns that the impending release of Islamist leaders like Choudary from prison could re-energise groups whose ranks have been thinned by deaths in Syria and other causes.‘Restrictions are not going to stop Anjem’s act,’ says Mr Deen. ‘Be it middle-men or whoever, he will find a way to make an impact. I would be very surprised if he has in any way been reformed by prison. He has too much invested in his image. Some think he doesn’t mean what he says, but he does. It’s the scariest thing about him.’            The new counter-terrorism bill should reduce the legal threshold for incitement, making it easier to prosecute the Choudarys of this worldSentences for most Islamist extremists in the UK have been relatively short due to the effective tactic of convicting them for conventional crimes. About half of known extremists were found guilty of other forms of criminality.This approach resulted in a spate of arrests but now many of those offenders are coming up for release, presenting the already stretchedsecurity services with a fresh headache. A BBC Newsnight report this week cited Akbar Dad Khan, a moderate Muslim councillor in Luton, who warns that al-Muhajiroun is far from a spent force and that ‘thousands’ of Muslims continue to support its aims.Imprisonment has failed to dent the enthusiasm of many extremists, and Britain’s embattled penal system has, if anything, served as a breeding ground for radicalism. Separation units are not billed as a punishment but as a precaution. So Islamist extremists enjoy access to television, participate in Friday prayers and are entitled to a halal diet.The separation unit at Frankland has been described as ‘successful’ but ‘claustrophobic’ by prison monitors. The three separation units in the country can hold just 28 prisoners in total.Before he tripped himself up over endorsing IS, Choudary was happy to exploit his country’s protection of free speech while rubbishing the freedom that allowed him to exercise it. ‘You see, we don’t believe in the concepts of freedom and democracy,’ he told an interviewer. ‘We believe sovereignty belongs to God.’Extolling the dystopian horror that was the so-called caliphate established by IS in Syria and Iraq, he went on: ‘They don’t see in the public arena things like alcohol, drugs, gambling, these kinds of vices. They’ve been completely wiped out.‘In many respects it’s the kind of society I’d love to live in with my family.’Radicalism is certainly a feature of the Choudary household. In 1996, Anjem married Rubana Akhtar, then 22. She proved to be every bit as extreme as her husband, being secretly filmed in 2016 speaking in favour of IS, making light of the burning to death in a cage of a captured Jordanian fighter pilot and predicting the destruction of the non-Muslim population of Britain.Their daughter, Hediya Mehraj, appears to have followed in her parents’ footsteps. In 2013, the then 16-year-old used Twitter to urge Muslims to wage holy war in Syria.The new counter-terrorism bill should reduce the legal threshold for incitement, making it easier to prosecute the Choudarys of this world. But the hate preacher of Ilford will be on his guard.‘Choudary was hard to catch in the first place and will be harder to catch in future,’ says Mr Videcette. ‘These people become skilled at countering electronic surveillance. They leave their phones in separate rooms and conduct business in open spaces. Messages will be passed by hand, and important contacts made through third parties.‘Our best bet is to make him as paranoid as possible. We will be looking to feed agents into his circle – people who will be recording him. Yes, we are going to bug his phone yes, we are going to break into his house and bug it and yes, we are going to install bugs in his car. Yes, every single person he talks to could be an agent.‘But we need to be at the top of our game. We are going to be stuck with him for some time.’Understandably, moderate Muslims are alarmed at the prospect of Choudary’s release. Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain says: ‘Mr Anjem Choudary has long been condemned by Muslim organisations and Muslims across the country, who consider him and his support for Daesh (IS) to be despicable.‘Many Muslims have long been puzzled why this man was regularly approached by the media to give outrageous statements that inflamed Islamophobia.’Surely the best thing to do – when once again Anjem Choudary attempts to spread his own special brand of hatred – is to ignore him. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/04/15/03EF9FDF0000044D-0-image-a-60_1536071295077.jpg","title":"Turkish worshippers prayed wrong direction Mosque nearly four decades","story":"    A villager prays in the right direction indicated by the white lines painted on the carpetSaudi Arabia plans to build a \u0027Riviera of the Middle East\u0027...Muharram 2018: When does the Islamic New Year start and how...Share this articleThe muftis said the Mihrab, a niche built into the Mosque\u0027s wall to indicate the direction of Mecca, was facing the wrong way.It is thought that the mistake was a relic from the old mosque so villagers may have been praying in the wrong direction for many more years.The faith says that prayers should be directed towards the Kaaba which sits at the centre of Islam\u0027s most sacred site in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.As a temporary solution Mr Kaya laid down arrows of white tape to point his flock right, the Hurriyet Daily News said.

It was then brought out for display at regimental gatherings. But when the last of the old \u0027Terriers\u0027, as the North Staffords called themselves, ended their reunions in the Seventies, the great canvas disappeared with them. Eventually, last year, it was found (wrongly labelled) in a warehouse. As they unrolled it, the staff were astonished.For here was a warscape on both a grand and human scale, set amid towns and villages with tragically familiar names like Ypres, Lens and Passchendaele.

Here the men witnessed their first aerial dogfight. Many regimental accounts refer to a grim scene on June 25, 1915, when a German pilot leapt from his burning plane right above the British lines — in pre-parachute days. And there he is.In the same year, the 5th North Staffords suffered their worst losses at the Battle of Loos when 800 men went over the top and 500 were lost in half an hour (including three brothers). They endured similar carnage a year later during the Battle of the Somme where they were ordered to charge an impregnable German bunker at Gommecourt Wood.By the start of 1918, so many men had been killed that the battalion was disbanded and its survivors transferred to other units, including the 6th Battalion which helped capture the Riqueval Bridge over the St Quentin Canal, a pivotal action at the end of the war. As a result, the bridge features right at the end of the \u0027tapestry\u0027.After the war, survivors resumed civilian careers. The last of the \u0027Terriers\u0027 is now long gone, of course.

By turns galumphing and graceful, the roughly £260m hulk contains an opera house, concert hall, theatre and recital hall, seating up to 7,000 people within its curvaceous shell. As Taiwan faces ever more pressure for assimilation from mainland China, whose cultural building boom has led to a new museum or concert hall open practically every week in recent years, the National Kaohsiung Centre for the Arts, AKA Weiwuying, is a monumental statement that this plucky nation means business on the international cultural stage.Gaping openings in the building’s hefty flanks beckon you into a cave-like landscape, where the floor rides up in great waves as the ceiling plunges down to meet the ground, forming a world of tunnels and canyons. The glossy-white steel skin is sliced open in places, bringing shafts of light into the space and offering intriguing glimpses of the venues within. It provides cooling respite from the tropical heat of this coastal city, channelling the breeze beneath its bulging belly to make a welcome place for picnics, tai-chi, yoga classes and some exhilarating swings.“We were struck by the informality of the performing arts in Taiwan,” says Dutch architect Francine Houben, whose practice, Mecanoo (designers of the Birmingham Library), won the competition for the project in 2007. “Chinese opera has its origins in street theatre, so we wanted to make a place that would feel as casual and informal as going to see a performance in the park.”The venue’s ambience is more that of a leisure centre than an opera house, particularly compared with Taipei’s national theatre and concert hall, each built in 1987, which stand on either side of the capital’s central square, like a pair of regal temples from the Forbidden City. By contrast, Weiwuying’s artistic director, Chien Wen-Pin, hopes people will spill into its theatres from the park, and treat it as their living room. “We had over 50,000 people turn up to our open day,” he says. “People occupied the space in a way were weren’t planning or expecting, taking their shoes off, doing exercise, lying in the shade, even breaking into song as they entered the concert hall.”Featuring the largest organ in Asia, designed as two thickets of bamboo with more than 9,000 pipes, the concert hall is a swirling symphony of oak and champagne-coloured seats, with a 22-tonne acoustic reflector dangling ominously from the ceiling. Despite its 2,000-person capacity, it feels surprisingly intimate, the furthest seat being 30 metres from the conductor. The Parisian magician of acoustics, Albert Xu, built a 1:10 model of it to ensure it provides the perfect reverberation time for everything from a classical orchestra to the twanging of the Taiwanese aboriginal mouth harp. He also worked his magic on the other three spaces, each designed with a distinct character and calibrated to accommodate a variety of art forms.The 434-seat recital hall has an asymmetrical seating layout, “so more people can see the pianists’ fingers”, say the architects, while its panelled walls can rotate to provide different levels of absorption, whether it’s hosting harsher classical Chinese music or jazz, or softer baroque chamber music. The playhouse, with deep blue seats, can accommodate an orchestra to the side of the stage (important for Chinese opera, where there must be a direct line of sight between the musicians and performers). Meanwhile, the deep red 2,236-seat opera house enjoys a humungous backstage, four times the size of the auditorium, conceived as a “theatre machine” that can contain the scenery and equipment for five different shows at once. “It’s even bigger and better equipped than Beijing’s opera,” Houben whispers conspiratorially about an important point of national pride.If the auditoria are exemplars of their kind, then the circulation and foyer space between them feels a little like an afterthought. With the four ovoid venues set in a rectangular volume stretching 225 metres long by 160 metres wide, there is a lot of leftover space, mainly decked out with acres of grey carpet, plasterboard walls and suspended ceiling tiles, every surface painted black or white, giving it a rather bleak, monotonous feeling. Within the building there is little of the spatial drama promised by the undulating plaza outside. Instead, it has the air of a deep-plan office block with theatrical ambitions.The architects are quick to point out that the budget is actually very tight for a project of this scale, which necessitated some of the prosaic fittings. While Jean Nouvel’s Philharmonie de Paris cost £340m, and Herzog \u0026amp de Meuron’s Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg was a whopping £690m (each housing a single auditorium), Mecanoo has provided four theatres in one for a fraction of the price.The robust, rough-and-ready quality is also somehow appropriate for the nature of this no-nonsense port city. “We wanted it to have the detailing of a cargo ship, not a luxury yacht,” says Houben, referring to the visible steel welding joints between the panels of the building’s billowing white hull. Those who aren’t told of the container ship allusion might just think it is badly finished, but various nautical markings reinforce the seafaring air.The bigger question is if this city of three million, which has enjoyed a single 1,600-capacity theatre until now, has the ability to fill such an enormous complex on a regular basis. The director of the £106m National Taichung theatre, another ambitious cave-like opera house, an hour away by train and built by Toyo Ito in 2015, admits it is struggling to sell tickets to its current run of Wagner’s Siegfried, after the novelty of the venue’s opening has worn off. Taipei, meanwhile, awaits the opening of its long-delayed £133m performing arts centre designed by OMA, another theatre, concert hall and blackbox auditorium combined in a thrilling multilayered transformer of a building.It is an extraordinary abundance of venues for one country to be opening in the  of a few years, all planned in the mid-2000s by different regional and national administrations. As China picks off Taiwan’s allies with dollar diplomacy (only 17 countries now recognise the island as independent, thereby disqualifying themselves from formal relations with China), it seems as if cultural diplomacy is one of the few weapons it has left.If the palpable level of excitement in Kaohsiung on the opening night of Weiwuying last week is anything to go by – when tens of thousands gathered in the park for a spectacular gala performance staged on the building’s outdoor amphitheatre, complete with an aerial ballet of drones – there’s an eager population waiting to fill its great halls with life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe1419ab907ee682630bffa4b05b2c25b1b31dc0/0_154_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9190a367589035b9707a93e48976b7cc","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The disappearance of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the aftermath of the earthquake in Palu, protests in Gaza and migrants in Central America and Mexico – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7301138b71e8d9807b9986042b444d6b9c883b88/0_122_5532_3319/master/5532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06f517903e2e1385ea99a35cd589efd5","title":"schadenfreude review tiffany watt smith","story":"Tiffany Watt Smith’s delightful book, full of jokes and confessions, ides examples of laughing at others’ misfortunes into good and badWhen I interviewed Daniel Craig for his first outing as James Bond, his pecs were ripped, his clothes elegant, his manner intolerably genial. The whole package was that of an alpha male at ease under interrogation by a babbling slob with no muscle tone. God, I hated him. And then he did something that cheered me up. He bent down to sip a banana milkshake and almost skewered himself with the straw. “Oooh, I nearly put my eye out,” he said in a satisfyingly effete voice.Evolutionary biologists suggest that the emotion of schadenfreude I felt then, that pleasure in witnessing a tall poppy cut itself down to size, stems from early societies that were dependent on cooperation and so needed to be egalitarian. That said, if Bond had actually put out his eye with the straw, I wouldn’t have delighted in his misfortune. Probably.But there’s more to schadenfreude than that. Tiffany Watt Smith’s favourite YouTube video features a cute toddler reaching out to a fluffy kitten, ostensibly to stroke it. Instead, the toddler punches it on the nose. The cat then rears up and swipes the child with its paw. Why is Smith’s resultant giggling socially defensible? “If you found this funny,” she writes, “you may be, in fact, celebrating the toddler learning an Important Life Lesson.” Whatever you need to tell yourself.Watt Smith argues with Freud, who suggested that when babies laugh at adult incompetence, it’s not because they have a sense of humour, but because they have a taste for gloating and triumph – or schadenfreude. After visiting psychologists at the University of London’s beguiling-sounding Baby Laughter Project, she comes to another conclusion: when babies laugh they are taking pleasure in surprise at the unexpected happening. That’s why they giggle at peekaboo and delight in adult fails. Laughter has a cognitive element: it helps us to see the world afresh and to learn. Such is what she calls good schadenfreude.I much prefer bad schadenfreude. The boss calling himself “Head of Pubic Services” on an important letter. The joy remainers took in the apostrophe in the slogan “Brexit Mean’s Brexit”. Giggling over the MP who called Jane Austen “our greatest living author”. I enjoyed it when Watt Smith, a university lecturer, happily tells us there’s an article suggesting students who complain about their lecturers are bad in bed. Even though that reads like wish fulfilment.I especially loved the story about Dutch schadenfreude at the nation that gave us the word. Towards the end of coverage of the 2010 football World Cup semi-final, ratings peaked on the German TV channel ADR. Why? Dutch viewers, realising Germany was poised to lose against Spain, were tuning in in their hundreds of thousands to hear German commentators describe their nation’s defeat.Watt Smith is at her best when she relates cases that flirt with bad taste. Racing driver Stirling Moss once told an interviewer why he thought so few women competed in Formula One:“I think they have the strength, but I don’t know if they have the mental aptitude to race.” He then walked off into an empty lift shaft, fell and broke his ankles. “Did you smile?” Smith asks her readers. Too right I did, though a split second later, I felt a twinge of self-disgust. If he’d just sprained his ankles, maybe I’d have had less compunction. Appealingly, Watt Smith isn’t above this grubby fray. She recalls feeling jealous of her husband. He was writing a book in another room as she struggled to complete this one. Then he got an email from an editor hailing the superb manuscript he’d submitted, while she got one from her publisher asking where the hell hers was. She yearned to take joy in his misfortune, but even after scrutinising his email she couldn’t find any cracks in the praise. After she confessed these feelings he, “being a very kind person”, laughed and then the two bonded by giggling over a successful writer getting their book trashed in a newspaper review. Schadenfreude – keeping couples together.Which brings me to my schadenfreude shame. Eight years after I gave Joanne Harris’s novel Coastliners a stinking review in these pages, she took her revenge by creating a sleazy  journalist called Jeffrey Stuart. But here’s the thing. Who felt more schadenfreude? Harris by trashing me in her fiction, or me for realising that my review must have really hurt if she had to take such an elaborate retaliation? Either way, the other week I found three copies of her book in a secondhand shop. I examined them and found all had their spines broken a third of the way through, as if each reader had given up 70 pages in.But I now realise my schadenfreude in finding these discarded books was just the joy of a petty man who can’t write a novel, not even one as terrible as Coastliners. Which is why I’d like to apologise to Harris for starting this mutually demeaning schadenfreude spiral 16 years ago.Nietzsche called it the joy of the impotent and insisted we should avoid it if we seek, as we ought, to overcome our shortcomings. Watt Smith, by contrast, concludes that in itself schadenfreude is “ethically ambiguous”. Yes, the 256 million of us who’ve watched the video of a dad getting kicked in the nuts by a toddler may not be better people as a result, but experiencing this emotion has, she suggests, its uses. It can make you feel good if you’re feeling inferior, highlight life’s absurdity, create a soothing solidarity among fellow failures, help take down a smug arsehole.On that last point, consider the suffragette Annie Kenney. “If you were my wife I’d give you poison,” yelled a man during a suffragette rally. “Yes, and if I were your wife I’d take it,” Kenney snapped back. Who could not enjoy the heckler’s misfortune?But are we living, Smith worries, in a Spitegeist where joy in others’ misfortunes becomes toxic and risks obliterating serious political debate? “If there was ever an environment that would leave us jonesing for a new hit of justice, it is our digital age.” For “justice” in the previous sentence, read schadenfreude, and think of TV host James Corden playing on it when he tweeted that the theft of Kim Kardashian’s jewels from a Paris hotel was not a fit subject for others’ joyful tweets at her misfortune. He had a point, but I can’t help feeling conflicted: anything that gets Corden moralising can’t be all bad.Watt Smith wrote her book as part of a research project for the University of London’s Centre for the History of the Emotions. It is filled not just with gags and shaming confessions, but chastening thoughts – nowhere more so than when she challenges the orthodoxy that schadenfreude has its limits. “Flirting with the morally questionable, testing the limits of where we ‘ought’ to stop, is an exciting game,” she argues. And not just a game but the basis of, say, Frankie Boyle’s career. But my pleasure curdled when I saw the author photo and blurb. Look at her with her smug scarf, clever hair and face, not to mention a Twitter handle referencing her doctorate. How I hope I’ll be stumbling into discounted piles of her book come January. But it is so delightful that probably won’t happen.Good grief, that last sentence was hard to write. Taking joy in others’ misfortune is easy applauding their achievement without rancour much more difficult.• Schadenfreude: The Joy of Another’s Misfortune is published by Wellcome Collection.

You often sit around waiting for an order. By 7.30pm there might be 50 people logged in. All you end up getting is about £20 to £25 a day. I only work for Deliveroo. I used to do work for Uber Eats but they blocked me after a customer complained that I hadn’t delivered something, when I had.“Because there are so many other workers there now, I usually end up doing about five deliveries, using my motorbike. My bike has been stolen twice. Once I managed to recover it, but everything was broken. The bike cost £1,600 so this has been really bad for me.“I don’t have a full-time job during the day. What I’m trying to do is make some money by buying and selling stuff on eBay, but it doesn’t make much. I’m trying to build my own website.“I have a wife and a young child. We pay £650 a month for a room in a two-bed flat, which we share with someone who rents the other room. My wife does some part-time teaching work but generally we live very much day to day.

But then you find yourself living on baked beans”Dan Martell, 26, is a Deliveroo rider in Brighton“I’ve worked for Deliveroo for the last two years. For the first year it was a bit of an adventure. It was possible to make a comfortable, if not particularly high level of living. It was the summer of 2016, there weren’t too many other Deliveroo cyclists around, and I was picking up £10 to £12 an hour. I was able to start paying off my overdraft. It was flexible, you could earn money, or take a day off, it was really good.“Then I got a knee injury. I couldn’t work for three months, and there was no sick pay from Deliveroo. I got a bit of statutory sick pay and my grandparents gave me £50 a week, but it soon became a beans on toast life.“I came back to work to find a lot of the other couriers struggling. Loads of the orders were going to the scooter guys. One ice-cold day in February 2017 there were 20 of us waiting outside all day for orders. In the end I earned just £4 that day.“I’ve had to get side jobs on building sites and pubs. I switched from bike to scooter with Deliveroo and started getting more drops. It was brilliant again. Then I got hit by a car. It was months before I was able to work again. Above all, it’s a very precarious living.

I like being self-employed. I have a target every day – some days are quiet, others very busy.“There are many more Uber drivers around now, but I’ve not seen a drop in fares or my income. I think it’s because Glasgow and Edinburgh had such a cap on hackney cab drivers.“I make good money. I work about 48 hours a week and it comes in at about £700. My income has actually considerably increased because of Uber. But in Glasgow, when the students go home, my income drops a fair bit.“It’s definitely safer working for Uber. Bad things are less likely to happen. When I was a private hire driver I was involved in a stabbing. And I’d get women touching my leg when driving. Don’t laugh. You wouldn’t laugh if it was a female driver saying that.“Uber can be harsh: I know a pal taken off for five days after a complaint from a customer. There were five of them, and it’s illegal to have more than four. But they said to Uber he was rude, and Uber believed them. That’s the thing with Uber – they give you no right of reply, they just take the money off you.“And I hate it when the customer says ‘I’ll give you five stars.’ I just wish they’d give a tip instead.”“Uber should be forced to do in London what’s happened in New York and ensure a minimum wage”James Farrar is a former Uber driver who won a court case over the minimum wage. Uber is appealing.“No Uber driver is ever given the benefit of the doubt. If the customer makes a claim, Uber suspends their account and it can be three weeks before they are back on. What I’ve been doing is fighting for better terms and conditions.“New York brought in a new system where Uber drivers are effectively guaranteed $15 an hour after costs. The idea is that for every hour the driver is logged on to the system, Uber has to top up the driver’s pay if they don’t reach the threshold through fares. What it means is that Uber no longer has any incentive to oversupply the platform with drivers. The tragedy of the system in the UK is that the only way you can make up for lack of fares is to work more and more hours.“We’re going to continue with strike action, and we’re urging people not to cross the digital picket line. We won in court, Uber appealed and lost, now it’s the court of appeal and, if it loses that, it will probably go to the supreme court. It could take seven years from start to finish.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c708184f94ae4869a94b7c685478a86eb19ab21/0_127_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f277203571c8a37fcfe56317e9c5621e","title":"rising high the evolving skyline new york city manhattan in pictures","story":"Manhattan’s skyline is the most famous in the world.

Some of them are the type who don’t normally go on marches, but they feel strongly and they want to make their voices heard. I won’t be joining them. Not because I don’t care about their feelings or voices, but because of the strange denial of what this is all about.Remainers would like a second referendum where all the deluded leavers suddenly see the light. They see themselves as wholly on the side of good. They want collaboration and cheap flights, good cheese and Spanish carers. They want to safeguard scientific research and human rights. Sure, I want those things too.Brexit, as it is being played out, is a disaster, boring beyond words and full of words that mean zilch. The dreadful feeling is that it will all go on for ever. Are we going to be Canada or Norway? No, we are going to be England. Does May know what she is doing? The friendless, sleepless leader ploughs on. The Labour party, meanwhile, has absented itself, mainly with an eye on its many leave-voting seats. Principles are traded like derivatives. Who knows what a Labour Brexit would look like?But really this is all about feelings – and I wonder why politicos are so bad at even beginning to understand this. Two years on, it is all, as Danny Dyer said, “a mad riddle”. Progressives still prefer to bully leavers rather than understand what drives them. Despising half the country is now the progressive position. So half the country are racist, old, small-minded, poor people who were seduced by a combination of Aaron Banks and delusions of empire. What these people really need is to be lectured constantly by a motley crew of metropolitan celebrities and has-been politicians (Clegg, Heseltine, Blair). Spare me, please.Maybe these people are supremely persuasive. But the reality is not – as is so often claimed – that leave voters regret their vote (some do, but not many). They mostly just wish it was over. Me too. I wish it was over.At one level, it is a disaster for progressives – and part of that is the refusal to see the Brexit vote as a revolution. It was, but just not the one we thought was coming. There was a massive turnout, and it was close. The simplistic idea that really people didn’t understand anything at all and were just very angry about austerity and neoliberalism is just that. Remove the agency of half the people, why don’t you? Sticking two fingers up to the establishment in an irrational and possibly self-harming way remains an analysis that no one wants to deal with. I see why. Self-harm is a form of agency when all else fails – but it is hard to watch.All the portents of that vote were there – and if you want to change things, you need to understand them. The remain tactic was to dismiss leave as irrational, and it still is. Understanding the power of the irrational is not the forte of political analysts.We are all familiar with the economic arguments and yet the earthquake of leave turned on its head the mantra that everyone votes out of economic interest. Something deeper and darker is going on. Identity matters, belonging matters. If the left don’t address these issues, the right owns them. Brexit was an act of transgression in terms of the articles of faith of liberal democracy – and it is this transgression that we need to address.A few thinkers recognise this, and a great collection of writings from Compass, The Causes of Brexit and the Cures, brings together Caroline Lucas, Lisa Nandy and John Harris among others to try and unpick what is happening. For all those marching on Saturday – marching because you are so sure in your hearts that you are on the side of good – can you not for one minute examine your own hearts and ask yourselves why half the country doesn’t share your cultural capital? Why Arts Council England spends £8 in Islington for every £1 it spends in the former coalfields? Why, as Neal Lawson puts it, so many people hit “the panic button”? Are you so convinced that we want another vote? Is this not a huge loss of faith in democracy? I myself sometimes waver – but I see a second referendum as undoable, expensive and part of a strange denial by the great and the good. And in the end, I don’t want to be told what to do by those who could not see it coming. Why am I to trust them? Because, yes, this is about hearts not just heads, as even the redoubtable Timothy Garton-Ash tells us today. Yet we don’t want to talk about the visceral. Everything must be subsumed to reason even when reason has been shown not to work. Often I think of an interview Mark Rylance did about the success of Jez Butterworth’s Jerusalem, long before Brexit. He spoke of the play “satisfying a hunger in audiences for wildness and defiance. There’s a feeling that they’ve eaten something they haven’t eaten for years – something they’d forgotten, that’s really needed for their health.”What was that thing? Nasty nationalism, a sense of agency, a revolt? Has that thing gone away, or will it be played by the likes of Steve Bannon? For while we dawdle in technocratic limbo, that thing remains and it will not be overcome by the rehearsal of numbers. Brexit is happening. The people voted. They were the wrong people.But raise your voices on Saturday. I will listen to your anger as you say no one voted for this. For the reason we are in this mess is a basic refusal to listen. And learn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1716cfbea4e0004325b8797cba1b1fd35a3df0f/657_843_3318_1991/master/3318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebcae0e15757687332f2fe7e55aed54f","title":"saudi arabia jamal khashoggi life mission brutal regime","story":"In death he is achieving his life’s work. Jamal Khashoggi was a Saudi patriot and reformer, whose journalism helped expose the reality of Saudi Arabia and the cosseted, hypocritical relationship the kingdom enjoys with the west. Through his brutal, pitiless death, he has succeeded more effectively in that mission than he could ever have imagined.The brightest light shone by the dissident journalist through his murder is, of course, on the morally repugnant nature of the regime that rules the nation he fled. The nauseating details of his killing, according to Turkish leaks – the bone saw the instruction from the lead limb-chopper, a doctor, to his colleagues to put on headphones and listen to music to distract themselves from the gruesomeness of their task the hasty repaint of the walls of the Istanbul consulate – confirm what we already knew. The House of Saud is itself soaked in blood.Besides its record of beheadings and amputations at home, Saudi Arabia has spent three years creating carnage in Yemen, and starving one of the world’s poorest nations of food and medicine – thereby imposing a crisis long deemed by the UN to be the planet’s worst humanitarian disaster. I can understand the frustration of campaigners for Yemen that the death of one man has captured a global attention that has so rarely focused on the tens of thousands killed in that dirtiest of wars. But sometimes it takes the story of a single inidual – his life and death – to break through. So it has proved with Khashoggi.His death has illuminated not only a general truth about Saudi Arabia, but the specific ugliness of its current ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Analysts say that, from the start, Bin Salman has been in the business of demonstrating power. The war on Yemen, of which he is credited as the architect, has been about projecting Saudi strength, as was last year’s arrest and imprisonment of hundreds of potential challengers to his authority, including members of his own family. The sheer brazenness of Khashoggi’s murder in a foreign country – with 15 Saudi officials flying into Istanbul carrying equipment to dismember a body, later followed by a squad of cleaners bearing mops before the Turkish authorities could inspect the premises – suggests a ruler who wanted to send a message: I can kill my enemies with impunity.And who can blame him for thinking that? After all, the world has barely acted to stay his hand in Yemen, or even to pay it much attention. A similar shrug greeted the Saudi abduction of Saad Hariri, Lebanon’s prime minister, during a visit to Riyadh last November – when, in the manner of a hostage video, Hariri was forced to read out a resignation statement that his Saudi hostscaptors had written for him. This, then, is the style of a young autocrat who only recently established a “tiger team” to conduct covert special operations, which sounds a lot like a death squad charged with hunting down anyone unlucky enough to find themselves on Bin Salman’s enemies list.It seems Bin Salman has now picked an intelligence official as his fall guy for the Istanbul murder, but his earlier lines of defence are instructive. For a while, state-controlled media were claiming that the 15 Saudi heavies caught on Turkish CCTV were in fact “tourists” unfairly accused. One wonders if they were drawn to St George’s Cathedral in Istanbul perhaps by its unusually tall spire.Of course, such excuses are all but meant to be laughable, to advertise the killers’ impunity – just as they were when they were offered by the alleged poisoners of the Skripals, who insisted they were in Salisbury to see the sights. Which brings us to yet another truth confirmed by Khashoggi in death: western hypocrisy. Those in Washington or London who, rightly, demanded Moscow face swift punishment for the attempted murder of the Skripals found themselves tongue-tied when it came to acting against Riyadh. Suddenly they needed to wait for a full investigation, albeit one conducted by the Saudis themselves. Imagine how they would have, rightly, mocked the notion of an inquiry conducted by Chief Inspector Putin.This double standard is not confined to governments, incidentally. Among those who, rightly, condemn the hypocrisy of the west, and who demanded instant action against Saudi Arabia, were some who were oddly more cautious in the Skripal case, open to all kinds of alternative, even wild explanations. In the same way, some of those who are, rightly, outraged by the slaughter in Yemen are curiously slow to show anger about the bloodshed in Syria. And yet a life taken is a life, whether it’s taken by a western ally, like Saudi Arabia or Israel or the US itself, or by a western enemy, such as President Assad or Putin.Of course, there’s nothing new about double standards and Saudi Arabia: British and US governments have been compromised for decades, thanks to dependence on Saudi oil and arms sales. Yet Khashoggi has put up in lights what is novel about the Trump era. For one thing, Trump is more open than his predecessors, admitting out loud that he doesn’t want to risk lucrative weapons deals.But he is also personally compromised, thanks to business ties – especially involving his son-in-law Jared Kushner – that point to a possible financial dependence on Bin Salman. What’s more, while previous US presidents at least paid lip service to Saudi human rights violations, Trump has cheered Bin Salman’s every move towards autocracy. (“Strongman” is Trump’s favoured form of government.) Note how in the very week that Saudi Arabia stands accused of murdering a journalist, Trump applauded a US politician for having body-slammed a reporter (my  colleague, Ben Jacobs). Again, who can blame Bin Salman if he believed Trump would indulge his version of robust action to curb a troublesome press? Kushner reportedly reckons that Bin Salman can ride out this current storm, that the media will soon lose interest. Others will hope that the realpolitik argument will prevail: that the west can’t act against the Saudis because we need them too much. But that’s nonsense. Riyadh does not cooperate with the west against terrorism or Iran for altruistic reasons: it does so out of self-interest. That self-interest will remain, even if Britain, the US and others move now to impose Magnitsky-style sanctions on those responsible for this outrageous murder. It’s the very least we can do, if only to honour a man who in death achieved what he sought to do in life – to force the world to look into the darkness of the desert kingdom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fb9117397e8153349364f0fc3ebf00ead14e29c/0_192_1668_1000/master/1668.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12adac3d23b69f1967f97fb499ead05c","title":"the guardian view on theresa mays brexit march to stop the madness","story":"If ever there was a reason for the people of Britain to take to the streets to protest about the reckless hazarding of our country’s interests, the Conservative government’s Brexit failure during the past two years provides one. If ever there was a moment to insist, through a peaceful display of outrage, that Britain can do so much better by following a different course, this is it. And if ever there was a chance for the voices that Theresa May’s government has consistently snubbed and ignored to shift the agenda of the Brexit debate away from the fantasies of the fanatical few towards the practical priorities of the ordinary many, then Saturday’s People’s Vote March for the Future provides that opportunity.Brexit is by any measure the most important change of strategic direction that this country has faced in more than 70 years. The people voted for it. But they did not vote for the terms of separation. Those remained to be negotiated, debated and agreed. The outcome of those negotiations with our European Union neighbours will shape the job prospects and life chances of anxious millions of Britons today and of future generations too. The terms on which the agreement is implemented will be pivotal to Britain’s – and Europe’s – shared ability, in a world where the rules-based order is increasingly under challenge, to deal with international problems ranging from banking stability and climate change to terrorism. The deal will also shape whether the United Kingdom – another union in which, as with the EU, our peoples have been better off together than apart – holds together or breaks into less consequential parts.From almost the very moment that the referendum result was declared, the handling of Brexit has been a story of unremitting and nationally humiliating failure. The negotiations were said to be simple. But they weren’t. The EU would bend over backwards, it was said, to give Britain special favours. It wouldn’t. Other nations would beat a path to Britain’s door to strike trade deals. They didn’t. Under Theresa May, the Tory party would bring the nation back together after the referendum. That didn’t happen either, because Mrs May and the Tory party didn’t even try instead they split ever more deeply. Not only has the government failed to strike a deal with the EU. It has even failed to reach a coherent agreement with its own MPs. As a result, Brexit threatens to be both a policy failure without precedent and a national betrayal whose reverberations will send tremors down the decades.This was supposed to have been the week in which the government finally struck a deal with the European Union. Whether you support or oppose Britain’s departure from the EU – and this newspaper still opposes it – a deal would be a turning point for Britain. It might – possibly – have been the time when some of the country’s post-Brexit economic and security needs could have been agreed. It might – potentially – have allowed the long process of healing some of the Brexit isions to begin. Instead, in Brussels this week, the moment simply came and went, with Mrs May’s government powerless to sign up.This is not just another unfortunate slippage of a timetable. It is yet another unavoidable collision between Brexit fantasy and Brexit reality. Yet this one risks, now more than ever before, a completely unacceptable sacrifice of the national interest to the interests of the Tory party, in the form of a no-deal crash-out from the EU. From the start, Mrs May has told the Tory party that she could deliver a form of Brexit that was simply not achievable. Nearly half of the country did not want this in the first place. Many more have become alarmed at the chaos and incompetence with which it has been pursued.The coming weeks will decide if Britain and the EU can forge a Brexit relationship that works for their peoples or not. Huge choices have to be made in parliament by MPs, perhaps including a second vote on the terms of any deal. All this is on the table. But the journey ahead requires leadership that neither main party has yet offered on an issue of such historic importance. Saturday is a day to bear witness to the urgent truth that Britain must have a far better future relationship with the rest of Europe than anything that Mrs May has come close to providing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ba18fec1239e9d1a75da6a4d6aa360fde1410c5/0_132_3088_1854/master/3088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97e10e54123cb31b852b26bee953e5f4","title":"harry and meghan where are you i cant see you","story":"There’s no experience like being in a crowd, waiting for a royal – no experience I want to go through again Life as a royal correspondent must be glamorous – all that rubbing shoulders with monarchs, flying around the country, getting a ringside seat for all the pomp and pageantry.But what’s it like from the other side of the fence that keeps the public from the anointed ones? What’s it like from the people’s perspective?Here’s my (half) week finding out ...Gee, this is boring, just waiting here and – for what? To see … them? What would seeing them achieve? Would it transform my life in any way? No, apart from the fact I need to see them for my job, but if I didn’t need to see them, would I be here? Probably not. Why is everyone else here then? Will seeing them change things for these people? Ugh, stop being so negative! It’s not about what you can get from the royals it’s about what you can give back to the royals. Meghan is pregnant FFS. It’s a special time. Then there’s the Invictus games. They are brilliant. Harry has done more to destigmatise mental health than almost any other public figure. You love him … kind of, in an abstract sort of way. He’s the prince you would most like to have a beer with. Isn’t it good it’s not Charles and Camilla visiting. That would have been dreary. Ugh, it’s hot. I’m getting sunburnt! Where are they?I leave my spot to go and interview some people dressed as Charles and Camilla (the people I interview are dressed as Charles and Camilla, not me). When I come back, I cannot get back in. More people have arrived. Also I am too short and can’t see anything. I take solace in the fact that there is nothing to see anyway.I find another spot behind some prams. Prams are good to stand behind as they are not high but wide. They form a barrier and you can see over the top.Some people from a sketch show arrive. They are dressed as royal fans and run up and down the forecourt screaming, “Harry, Harry remember me? We met in Orange in 2014! You shook my hand!” People loathe them, I can feel it. I loathe them – and I don’t even like the royals that much. We loathe them because when they are mocking the royals, they are also mocking us, mocking us for being here, for lining up in the sun, for three hours, for a glimpse … or if we’re lucky, a touch.In my area, my people – for that is who they have now become – are on their phones. There is a ripple, the royals are there! There! Where?! There! There? There! I jump up and down on the spot. I cannot see a thing! Where? There!I break away from the pram area and rush to the top of the crowd. It is 12 deep! They are there ... somewhere! This is a terrible idea! I can see even less here! I try to climb on a fence and fall down. There is a guy in front of me – he has the world’s biggest selfie stick and he is tall. The only way to see the royals is to look at them through his camera.I tap him on the shoulder. “Show me your phone.” He ignores me. Maybe he doesn’t speak English.I go back down to my former section where I tell my people that the royals are up there but I couldn’t see anything. “Too short, too many people, everyone just holding their phones over their heads.” I need a ladder. The royals are moving slowly. At this rate they would get to us at 4pm. By then the sunburn would be catastrophic. I am telling my people about the tall man with the selfie stick when suddenly a car whizzes past. Our area gasps. “It’s them!”The disappointment is crushing. My people had spent hours standing, packed into this godforsaken bit of Opera House forecourt only to see a car. “I wasted hours for this,” says one traumatised man as he packs away his Australian flag.I try not to feel smug, but tomorrow I will going to Dubbo, where the royals are visiting a community picnic. It isn’t over for me. I will definitely see them at this sparsely attended picnic.I arrive four hours early to the parkto find at least 10 times the number of people at this picnic as there were at the Opera House.All around, bits are enclosed off, and around the enclosures, people sit two or three deep. No one knows if the royals are going to come to their enclosure or if they have backed a dud, shadow enclosure. I tell anyone that will listen about my horror story from the Opera House – “they just whizzed by our section, IN A CAR!”For four hours I shuffle around from one enclosure to the next, assessing the best vantage point for when the royals eventually arrive.It is now of paramount importance that I see them. All this time. All this sunburn. How could it be for nothing? As I roam the parameter of the swelling crowd, never quite committing to a “spot”, always thinking the next area will be “it” – I feel something akin to existential dread.What is life about anyway? This? I fall into a brief depression and settle on a spot. It is 20 deep, behind a school of children. But it has a television screen that shows the news (people around me boo when it shows footage of Scott Morrison) and I console myself that at least I will see them – even if it is on a screen.The MC tells us they will be here soon and (again) a ripple of excitement goes through the crowd. Will this mean Thirsty Merc will finally stop playing?“Remember they like to see your smiling faces – so don’t just stick a camera in their faces,” says the MC.People start cheering when the screen shows the duchess getting out of a car. They are here! Hang on, this is old footage they are replaying on the screen, when they were at the Flying Doctors service. This mutes the crowd – what is real, and what is a replay? We don’t know. We don’t want to cheer at the news or get excited at old footage.Then the announcement that they are here. Where? Here. The screen shows them getting out of a car. Is it here? Then suddenly it starts raining. Not on the screen but in real life. And not just a little bit but Old Testament style storms. This was what they built the ark for.My area, in fact all areas, faces a choice. We either perish here in the park, trying to get a glimpse of the royals, or we flee to shelter.At a cafe down the main street, after I purchase dry clothes from the op shop, three tables of us get talking. There is a group of women from a nearby farming community, in their 70s, and a husband and wife from Dubbo, also retired.“Did you see anything?” I ask.“Waited all that time.”“I didn’t see them in Sydney, and didn’t see them in Dubbo!”Two school girls come into the cafe with life-size cutouts of Harry and Meghan, cracking everybody up. We all pose for photos with the cardboard Meghan and Harry.This is it. This is the closest we are ever going to get."},{"url":null,"title":"trevor noah stephen colbert jamal khashoggi voter suppression","story":"Late-night hosts discussed Trump’s latest remarks on the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and attempts to suppress voters before the midtermsLate-night hosts covered Donald Trump’s latest refusal to attack the Saudis for their alleged involvement in the presumed death of Jamal Khashoggi and discussed voter suppression in Georgia.On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed reported attempts by the Republicans to suppress voters. “This year every single vote counts, but there are a few states that are working to change that,” he said.He continued: “It’s like being a contestant on Jeopardy! and instead of trying to win by being the smartest person, you just spend all your time tasing your competition.”Noah moved on to the hotly contested race in Georgia between Stacey Abrams, who could be the first black female governor in the US and Brian Kemp, who could be “the first white governor named Brian Kemp in Georgia, I think”.The latest ruling insists that the name on a person’s driver’s license must be exactly the same as their real name with the slightest mistake meaning that someone won’t be able to vote. “It’s funny how this happens with voting but it never stops the IRS,” Noah said.The majority of people affected by the ruling are black. “Well, well, well, my old friend racism, I’ve been expecting you,” he joked.Noah continued: “Isn’t it interesting how every time Republicans create a voting restriction, it just so happens to disproportionately affect people of the brown brown?”He expressed frustration at another attempt to stop people of colour from voting. “You don’t have to say who you’re targeting to target someone, you just have to say which rules are likely to hit them most,” he said. “Like, if I was trying to block white people at the voting booth, I wouldn’t need to say ‘No white people are allowed’, I’d just be like ‘Sorry, no pumpkin spice lattes in the voting booth.’”Noah explained that Kemp is also secretary of state in Georgia so essentially controls the regulations that affect this year’s vote. “That is some Africa-level shit right there,” he said.Noah’s idea is that “every black person in America needs to register as a Republican” so they will be allowed to vote. “They will make sure every vote counts,” he said. “They’re going to be waving Trayvons into the voting booth like a third-base coach.”On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert started with news that special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s alleged ties to Russia will be released after the midterms. “Enough waiting,” he said. “Mueller’s been teasing us for so long at this point, even Sting is like, ‘Just finish already.’”Trump continues to choose financial ties to Saudi Arabia over criticising them for their alleged involvement in the disappearance of Khashoggi leading some to claim he is showing an uncharacteristic amount of caution. “Yes, an uncharacteristic amount,” he said. “In other words: any.”While speaking to the press, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, referred to Khashoggi’s alleged death as an incident. “Just like the Hitchcock movie Dial M for Incident,” Colbert quipped.Turkish reports have said the alleged killing was carried out by a squad of 15 Saudis, one of whom has since mysteriously died in a car accident. “Right now in Riyadh, there are 14 other guys saying, ‘It’s a nice day, I think I’m gonna walk,’” he said.Televangelist Pat Robertson was on television this week to defend Trump’s decision to choose the importance of an arms deal with Saudi Arabia over the life of one journalist. “Thank you Reverend for capturing the core message of Christianity: how important can one man’s death be?” he joked.There was also a report that the chief of staff, John Kelly, and national security adviser, John Bolton, has a profanity-laced argument outside the Oval Office. “Well, it’s good they didn’t do it inside the Oval Office,” he said. “That is reserved for the sacred presidential duty of tweeting about porn stars being horsefaces.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18df1b107396e82d489d3fb24eaeee16790026d/0_212_3173_1904/master/3173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf5445f0930b79c23181e2a9e98bcd62","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A 1,000-metre spider web and a hellbender devouring a snake are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e4a75435365a2a2300e29973d18af91b9f8795b/0_172_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c42d2de12816b44309e4f814613f2b42","title":"javier bardem woody allen defence","story":"The Spanish actor has spoken in defence of the director, calling him a ‘genius’ with whom he’d work again immediatelyJavier Bardem has spoken out in support of Woody Allen, who directed him and his wife Penélope Cruz in the 2008 comedy Vicky Cristina Barcelona.Bardem’s comments emerged from a masterclass at the Lumiere festival in Lyon, France.

He’s a genius.”Bardem’s attitude contrasts strongly with a number of high-profile actors, including Colin Firth, Greta Gerwig, and Timothée Chalamet, who have said they regret working with Allen and won’t do so again, following a newspaper article in 2013 by Allen’s daughter Dylan Farrow in which she repeated accusations of child sexual abuse by her father, alleged to have taken place in 1992. Allen denies all the allegations. An investigation by the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut concluded in 1993 that no abuse had taken place, and New York state’s Department of Social Services cleared Allen later the same year following a child welfare investigation.Allen, meanwhile, has said that he intends to keep working despite the hostility of large sections of the film industry. Page Six, the New York Post’s gossip section, reported Allen as saying: “I’m a writer. It’s what I am. What I do. What I always will be. I’ll write. Since I continually have ideas it’ll be new ideas and I’ll write new things.”Allen’s most recent film, A Rainy Day in New York, has yet to secure a release date."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecb714834db18244ef43d9238bfe6e152eea7191/0_170_1764_1058/master/1764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8e3c2da67c919db8dfa508a515df3c4","title":"tell us how does it feel to watch a classic film on first release","story":"As audio of frenzied audience reactions to the original Halloween has gone viral, we want to hear your stories of seeing defining films at the cinemaThe much-hyped release of the latest Halloween installment (tipped to break records with a $70m opening) has led many to think back to the film that started it all back in 1978.While there have been rankings aplenty, there’s also been a rather fascinating video going viral that gives us an idea of what it would have been like to see the original on the big screen.

The actor, along with other film-makers, asks whether that moment actually made a difference“There’s a mistake. Moonlight. You guys won best picture. This is not a joke. Come up here.” The fiasco of the 2017 Oscars, when retro musical La La Land was initially, erroneously, given the best picture statue, was unfortunate beyond the unbearable cringe of the mix-up itself. The kerfuffle obscured the fact that Barry Jenkins’s coming-of-age tale about a boy growing up gay in Florida had just made history: a film with an all-black cast, with a story not about racism or slavery but simply contemporary black people’s lives, had won the Academy’s top prize.It’s the watershed moment that opens Black Hollywood: “They’ve Gotta Have Us”, a new documentary series by the artist and photographer Simon Frederick. The three-part oral history of black cinema replays that Academy Awards debacle, then spools back to laud cinema’s original black trailblazers. Moonlight is to some extent presented as the full stop at the end of a story about a fight for representation. So was it a new dawn or is there much more work to do? What happened next?Moonlight’s win put an end, temporarily at least, to #OscarsSoWhite, a campaign against the overwhelming whiteness of the awards that had begun two years earlier when the Martin Luther King biopic Selma was among several films whose black stars were overlooked. But since then, David Oyelowo, who played King, has embodied an uncomfortable dichotomy. He has consciously starred in types of films that, still, rarely have black leads: the comic thriller Gringo, and the romantic period drama A United Kingdom. He’s been glad to break that ground, while feeling exasperation that his films carry such extra significance. “If my white colleagues do a comedy like Gringo,” Oyelowo says, on the phone from his home in Los Angeles, “it doesn’t become about ersity or representation. It’s just pure entertainment.”Oyelowo, who is among the interviewees in Black Hollywood: “They’ve Gotta Have Us”, is “Hollywood’s ersity champion”, according to a BBC News article this year. How does he feel about that responsibility? “I hate it. I really wish it wasn’t mine. It’s not why I do what I do. But I embrace it because this is where we are.”Where we are, nevertheless, is a place where black performers and film-makers are in a stronger position than ever. “Moonlight was really important,” says Nathalie Emmanuel of Game of Thrones and Fast \u0026amp Furious 7 fame, who is also interviewed in Black Hollywood. “So many people needed to see that story. La La Land had been criticised for its lack of ersity, so for a black story to win against it was huge. As a result of that, Get Out and Black Panther and BlacKkKlansman opened up the door. I’m reading so many more scripts now that centre around black and brown people.”This change has been a long time coming. Although it adds archive clips to the mix, Black Hollywood retains the distinctively styled, intimate interviews that made up Frederick’s previous series, 2016’s Black Is the New Black. Remarkably, the speakers include three actors who can claim to be cinematic pioneers: 91-year-old Harry Belafonte, 83-year-old Claudine star Diahann Carroll, and British actor Earl Cameron, who is 101. Their recollections are lucid and personal, a direct line to a distant but still acutely relevant past. Belafonte and Carroll talk revealingly of their interactions with Sidney Poitier, and how for years he bore the burden of being the icon of black film acting. The evolution of black cinema in the latter part of the 20th century is then analysed by other contributors, including Barry Jenkins.In terms of box office performance, the next step beyond Moonlight, an independent movie that earned its modest budget back many times over, was the following year’s Black Panther. An entry in the expensive, expansive Marvel superhero franchise, it was a colossal hit, proving that such films can have a black cast. “I smiled all the way through it,” says Frederick. “They have technology that is ahead of the curve, but they can’t tell anyone because it wouldn’t be seen as credible. And if it was, someone would take it away from them, or people would be fearful of it. For me, it was an analogy for black film-makers. They have always known they could make content that would touch the lives and souls of audiences who saw it. There were just gatekeepers telling them they couldn’t. Now, black film-makers are leading a revolution in film that is not just about them, but women, the LGBTQ community, everybody who is seen as ‘other’.“Black film-makers realised they didn’t need the permission or approval of the industry,” Frederick adds. “They realised the lessons they’d been taught by Harry, Sidney, Diahann and Earl: you have to go out and make your own careers, defined by yourself. Black film-makers are doing things now on their terms.”Oyelowo arrives at the same point about self-sufficiency from a different angle. “We cannot expect what our white counterparts can expect, which is a pipeline of opportunities coming their way that they haven’t necessarily created. Idris Elba is directing, he’s producing, he’s creating his own opportunities. John Boyega is doing the same. Eighty per cent of what I do nowadays is stuff I’m developing because I know I cannot rely on my industry to keep me creatively fed. White actors do that, but we have to do it – that’s the difference.“What we don’t pay enough attention to is black and brown actors being afforded the opportunity to fail,” he continues. “When something we do doesn’t work, it becomes an excuse to not do it again.” Oyelowo cites duds such as The Dark Tower starring Idris Elba, which are used as evidence that black actors cannot front such a movie. “His co-star in that film, Matthew McConaughey, who I adore, is not subjected to the same scrutiny if he does films that don’t work at the box office. Every white male star or director has had films that didn’t work.“I’m not browbeaten or steaming with anger,” Oyelowo concludes. “I am incredibly proud of the fact Selma was not only a film that people responded to in and of itself, but was part of a movement towards the very thing that we’re talking about now. I feel great about all these indicators we see of change and real progress. What I love about They’ve Gotta Have Us is that we are in a moment where we can talk about the successes, about Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier and Denzel Washington as beacons. What you’re seeing in the documentary is a sense of pride and galvanised energy. It’s an opportunity to celebrate, but also to keep our industries accountable. My thing is vigilance. We are prone to pendulum swings. Moonlight doesn’t signify arrival it signifies hope. It’s a journey we are still on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50eef110e9bdb4edec2ffefde4f4efd5130f65e4/0_298_1373_824/master/1373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e83583ec524e7021cd4f2e04e551e97a","title":"jack monroe on jamie oliver the cooks cook","story":"A chance cookbook purchase turned Jack Monroe on to a cheeky, chatty, more confident way with foodOne of the only books I had as a single mum on the dole was 30 Minute Meals. I had bought a copy at my local Waterstones while I was still working at the fire brigade. It jumped out at me. At the time, cookbooks were glossy, beautiful, aspirational, whereas this was: “Look, you can do this in half an hour or less, what are you waiting for?” And I thought, “All right, I’ll give it a go.”I’ve riffed off his recipes so often. All the pastas, the quick pizza doughs, the mushroom risotto, tomato soup, the curries. I’d flick through the book, knocking out ingredients I didn’t have and changing them to fit whatever I could afford at the time. It is a comforting classic.The puttanesca recipe is still one of my favourites. When I first read it, I’d never heard of the dish before. Jamie uses fresh tomatoes, anchovies and capers, but I thought, I can make that with tinned stuff. I put it all together and it was amazing it didn’t taste like I was eating “poor person food”. There’s such a stigma around what people in dire financial circumstances can eat. And really it was just a tin of tomatoes, a tin of fish, some lemon juice, salt and pepper. But it tasted like actual great food. It’s cropped up again and again in my own books, in various guises.All Jamie’s early stuff was cheeky but encouraging. It’s how I try to communicate with my readers now: simple, chatty, bish bash bosh, come-into-my-kitchen banter. And you can’t take away from what an impact that had on people’s cooking. It was revolutionary. I don’t know if it’s because he started out in a pub, or that he’s worked in kitchens, or that he is also raising a family, but he meets it from every possible angle.His recipes are brilliant. I’ve never made one that hasn’t worked. He’s not prescriptive or obsessive. To be sure, he loves what he loves, and always places a great emphasis on good-quality ingredients, but there’s no condescending undertone that if you don’t have this ingredient, you can’t make this great recipe. And that instils great confidence in a cook. There’s real skill in being able to give people both a set of instructions and the freedom to do whatever they want.Confidence is important. Lots of people don’t cook because they’re scared to. What I loved about Jamie Oliver’s early work was his little kitchen, the simplicity of it all. His execution might have sometimes been a little clumsy, but his basic message of cooking what you can with what you’ve got is a good one.If I did meet him, I would love to just cook for half a day with him and see what nuggets of wisdom I could pick up. And I’d also want just to say thank you. His work has had a real impact on me. Even now, if I’m stuck for a recipe or an ingredient, I’ll go on his website and have a little poke around."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e28da6c82c32c574e208e76bcf5a6795f9d3d7b/280_407_4963_2978/master/4963.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae1c2d4a7edfa9da9c0699bca3b0848c","title":"four vegan recipes bosh chinese caribbean italian mexican students","story":"Classic Italian, Chinese, Caribbean and Mexican dishes get a plant-based makeover250g portobello mushrooms5 tbsp soy sauce20ml maple syrup20ml cider vinegar20ml olive oil130g cashew nuts5 garlic cloves190ml plant-based milk10g nutritional yeast150g silken tofu300g spaghetti125g peas1 handful flat-leaf parsley or rocket, to serveHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6, and line a baking tray with baking paper.

Klopp admits the focus on defensive improvement has had a detrimental effect on Liverpool’s forward play, with Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino yet to recapture last season’s heights, but was necessary to provide a platform for a title challenge. He insists Liverpool can develop defensively “without killing our nature”.The Liverpool manager, who could have Salah and Mané available after injury problems on international duty, said: “We want to be stronger defensively but that doesn’t mean we don’t have interest in offensive things. It is normal in a period of adaptation. You put the focus a bit more on something – close this gap, close this space – and immediately you lose a bit of the fluency in something else. But we have created enough chances it’s just that we didn’t use them like we used them in the best period of last season.“We have had good results and scored goals but it’s obvious we can improve. We need to keep the stability, no doubt about that. What we’ve done defensively so far is credit to the whole team. We don’t concede a lot of shots in general. It’s not that we don’t concede because Alisson makes one world-class save after another. We don’t let them shoot often and that’s the best thing.”Liverpool rank ninth for the effectiveness of their pressing game among Premier League teams this season, according to Opta. Klopp believes the statistic reflects a change in tactics against Liverpool – and his team’s maturity when in winning positions – rather than a radical departure from pressing on his part.“It’s more the case that teams don’t usually play against us,” explained Klopp. “They overplay our pressing with long balls, which makes sense. In a lot of games our counter-press has been really good, which is much more important in terms of losing the ball and winning it back. In terms of the high press, it depends on the style of play of the other team. You can’t do it if they don’t play. It’s not that we don’t want to do it any more. If they play then we should be there.“It’s not been a proper plan to sit back a little bit more but we have done that after being 1-0 or 2-0 up in games. We did sit back a bit more to not give space away, that’s true. It’s a question of maturity and that makes absolute sense. With the number of games we have it’s not about chasing a game always like crazy, you have to be smart. We try to be that without killing our nature.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04a8102d10edb10bb331bc9c78df9aff90d8cc53/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b0554716f95a3911dab0e2a79c4c5f3","title":"paul scholes manchester united","story":"Their club’s former midfielder has turned into an effective pundit but his targets need to be more wide-rangingI remember having a discussion at least a decade ago about things you just couldn’t say in a football press box, the kind of stuff that could get you excommunicated from polite society. The opening suggestion was something along the lines of: “So, Paul Scholes. Not that great is he?”Even now I can hear the snorts of rage and the sound of newspapers hurled to the floor. And rightly so. Under current UK law criticism of Scholes is still punishable by anything from a lifetime ban to being stabbed through the ear with a skewer by the Queen while weeping, reproachful children stick pins into the back of your hands.This sanctity is well-earned. First because Scholes was such a fine player, both very English in his bearing and his manner, and also exotic in the range of his craft, the way he could drive and unpick a game.Part of the joy of Scholes was the way he just so clearly loved kicking the ball, which seems an odd thing to say until you remember how much he loved it: backspin, fade, drift, those vicious little pinged crossfield nudges and volleys and ks, the way the ball just seemed to come alive with some other kind of intelligence at his feet. Leave him alone on a Pacific island with only a ball for company and within the year he’d have it following him around, hunting for squirrels, building an irrigation system, lovingly trimming his beard.Plus Scholes had that patina of authenticity. He played for only one club, albeit the most famous and wealthy and successful one, but you get the idea. He refused to preen and prance, to such an extent he would occasionally draw attention to the fact he didn’t preen and prance so humble that his humility just isn’t something he likes to talk about except when he’s talking about it. This is also very English. In retirement Scholes has become a devastatingly good misery-pundit on BT Sport, a brilliantly salty and astringent presence, as English as winter rain, with special responsibility for the struggles of Manchester United. His ability to twang the most painful exposed nerve ends is compelling. In this sense he is a very good pundit. He frames the debate. He has become a part of it.But there is a problem here too, bound up in the enduring weight of his own status. Scholes is right. There do seem to be quite a few problems at Manchester United. But it is hard not to feel that this sense of unhappy voices-off and star names constantly sniping might just be one of them.Unexpectedly, Scholes the no-bullshit team-man has become the single largest public irritant for every manager that has followed Alex Ferguson. “He’s killed me there” was David Moyes’s response as he stood with the players watching Scholes pick his United team apart after the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City in March 2014. Moyes chose the wrong moment to be right. A month later he was gone.Louis van Gaal was also routinely eviscerated towards the end. Right now it’s both barrels for José Mourinho, a manager Scholes clearly doesn’t like and about whom he will say anything he fancies. This week there was the suggestion even Lionel Messi would be unable to function in this current team, and that Romelu Lukaku is also a part of the problem. Really? And Pogba? And Mourinho too? Are we dealing in certainties here, or throwing out lines, trying to be right, trying to win the narrative?It is all great television. I’m already hoping Scholes is up for Huddersfield versus Liverpool this Saturday so he can pronounce on United’s early kick-off at Chelsea. But there are a couple of things worth saying about all this. First, for all his first-hand experience, his brutal eloquence, maybe Scholes isn’t actually the best person to talk about things being dysfunctional at Manchester United.Scholes speaks from a position of immense privilege. He was an astonishingly talented player who spent his whole career surrounded by other astonishingly talented players under the greatest manager of the age. United were the richest club in England for most of that time. When the first billionaires began to turn up conditions were perfect. The bigger question back then was: what would it have taken for United to fail? If Scholes sounds genuinely baffled at bad choices, teams that turn sour, irresolvable structural problems, then perhaps he is.Whereas in the current era nothing makes much sense. The defining quality is frantic, misdirected energy. United have a £90m midfielder. Great news. But is he actually any good? And how much does he hate the manager? United have spent hundreds of millions on bolt-on parts. Why aren’t they better? Maybe because a club built on aristocratic continuity has spent hundreds of millions on bolt-on parts, an operation overseen by successive mismatched managers and a puzzled-looking banker in a baggy suit.Anyone can see the glitches on the surface. How much more worthwhile, how much more illuminating if Scholes could turn his fire on the structures behind the disposable faces. Where is the criticism of the club hierarchy? Where is the anger towards the owners, who continue to use one of the nation’s great sporting institutions as a cash-sluicer, and who have overseen this period of piecemeal, self-interested stasis?Plus, of course, there are the wider inanities of modern football, the billionaire-ball short-termism, the shrill tides of contrary opinion and vested interest. It is easy to goggle at the fallout from this process. But at some point you also have to decide which side of it you want to be on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c92a3f220bdd1c99c8cb10d823b6bc1fa1eda3e9/0_87_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1cef98ebb03bf4e9f0aab975a46e79f","title":"is my child old enough for a mobile phone","story":"No matter when parents choose to entrust their offspring with a smartphone – and it very much depends on the child in question – there’s agreement that boundaries about usage must be establishedThere are many milestones in the relationship between parents and their children. The first step. The first word. The first time they turn to you and say: “Please stop, you are embarrassing me.” To these, we can now add the moment a parent solemnly hands their child their first mobile phone. But what’s the right age for this to happen? According to Dr Linda Papadopoulos – a child psychologist and ambassador for Internet Matters, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to children’s online security – the beginning of secondary school is a good starting point. “It makes them contactable and means they can get in touch with their parents if things go wrong,” she says. “A lot of their peers will get a phone at that age, so it means they can communicate with their friends and feel part of that.” Some believe that the right age may be even earlier. The moment when children start travelling alone on a regular basis is a commonly recommended start point for a phone – which in some cases could be a year or two before or after they start secondary school. Sean Hargrave, a tech journalist and father of three, says: “It’s when your children are spending more time on their own. Their independence and geographic borders start to widen, so it makes sense to trust them with a smartphone.” Statistics suggest that most parents tend to agree that secondary school is the right age for a phone, with a July 2018 survey of 1,000 parents by Tesco Mobile concluding that the mean age most think a child should have their first phone is 11. But a mobile is more than just a phone, it offers access to a multitude of information and ideas. Much of this is positive – a child can use the phone to look up bus timetables and talk to friends, as well as let adults know when they require the parental taxi service – but parents still need to remain engaged, continually talking to children about their internet use and monitoring the sites they access and the amount of time they are online. For this reason, some experts suggest that there’s no such thing as a right age for a phone, with it depending entirely on the inidual child, the parents and the circumstances.  “When a child first receives a smartphone is a parent’s choice,” says Andy Burrows, head of child safety online at the NSPCC – which has introduced a guide to children’s online safety called Net Aware. “What’s most important is that mums, dads and carers have early conversations with their children.” For Papadopoulos, it is essential to have these conversations. These shouldn’t be lectures, but instead should encourage a child to think critically. “Until now, they will mainly have communicated face-to-face now they are communicating using texts, memes and emojis. What does it mean if they send a picture to one friend and not another? How do group chat dynamics work? Invite them to talk to you and think about these things.”  Having seen three children reach an age where they are entrusted with a phone, Hargrave has had some testing moments, but also feels children get a lot from their new devices. “They are using them for so many different things – they might be playing games, making films, watching TV, chatting to friends, researching homework,” says Hargrave. “It’s not just sitting in an armchair tapping screens. One of my kids makes films, another does arty stuff, one researches astronomy. They are a force for good, it’s just about having parameters.” And once the boundaries are established, children will be better equipped to enjoy their new device no matter what their age. Encouraging a healthy dynamic around mobile phone usage might even be easier if children get their first phone at a younger age. Hargrave believes that retaining parental access to the phone is essential, which is easier to do with an 11-year-old than a teenager. “The phone is a great safety device and it’s also great for them to communicate with their peers, but you need to keep an eye on it,” he says. “You need to have a conversation, let them know you will look at their phone periodically. You should only do it when they are there and the phone is in front of you. It’s not right to rifle around behind their backs.” It’s natural for parents to worry about their child in any new situation, and mobiles are no exception. While that can be mitigated by the use of parental controls and location tracking, these technological solutions don’t absolve parents from the responsibility of parenting. “We know that this is something parents worry about,” says Papadopoulos. “Up to now, everything the child has done the parent will have done first. But now the child will be using apps the parents have never heard of. It can make us feel insecure. But you do need to engage. You can’t just say: ‘I don’t understand.’ That’s not good enough. You need to understand, you need to get on the apps and figure them out for yourself.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdbf79728fe1b052ae2e3d67fb45248b0ae7a5fe/0_2099_4672_2803/master/4672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0120a147f680ba3ba1b92962b23427f5","title":"switch off your phone and start bonding great ideas for family nights in","story":"Cutting down mobile usage is a great way to create family time. Here are the best TV programmes, films and games to enjoy with your family this autumnTrying to find more family time together by limiting your mobile phone usage is a good thing, and experts increasingly agree that it’s important to establish family ground rules for phone usage. Family tech expert Andy Robertson and Tesco Mobile’s new contract for mobile phone usage is designed to help families set healthy limits. It’s a great way to increase the amount of time you have to spend together, particularly as there are absolutely loads of brilliant new family-minded games, films and TV to enjoy on a night in this autumn. Here is our pick of the best.Keep Talking and Nobody ExplodesGame, PS VR  Oculus Rift  HTC Vive  Samsung Gear VRStrapping on a VR headset sounds like a fairly efficient way off blotting out one’s family entirely, but there are a few games designed with social, on-couch multiplayers in mind. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes puts the headset-wearer in the reinforced boots of a bomb disposal technician. They must then describe said explosive to their teammates, who issue increasingly tricky instructions to disarm it from a manual. Cue much filmic “the red wire!” “which red wire?!” bickering and a fair bit of genuine tension. With VR headsets now affordable to those without hereditary peerages, this could be a fine reason to invest.Monster HuntFilmYou could settle for the latest po-faced superhero smash-em-up that plops from Marvel’s blockbuster-peristalsis machine, but it doesn’t hurt to go off-piste with your movie-watching from time to time. And Hollywood is far from the only place producing epic family movies. Spirited Away or Howl’s Moving Castle – any of Hayao Miyazaki’s oeuvre, really – offer just the right balance of whimsy and menace, but for sheer epic scale, try Raman Hui’s charmingly weird action-comedy, and its barmy $150m sequel (Monster Hunt 2). The plot about monsters and humans happily coexisting until they don’t is basically nonsense, but you get a lot of bang, fart jokes and spectacle for your buck.Wynona EarpTV show, Netflix  SYFYThink Buffy on a budget and you’re in the right area. Wild west moustache enthusiast Wyatt Earp was in fact a demon hunter, you see. His curse – the curse of having to shoot demons in the middle of the face – was then passed down through his heirs, until it landed in the lap of Wynona, a wisecracking, leather-jacketed ex-juvie tearaway with a penchant for booze and thumping people. The show’s tone is on the mature end, but is light enough for most young teens, keeping its scares, sexual references and profanity just on the correct side of Mary Whitehouse. It’s a ton of knockabout, demon-slaying fun.PandemicBoard game, 2-4 playersThere is nothing – nothing – more certain to trigger a weeks-long Christmas-ruining family row than a “friendly” game of Monopoly. But the award-winning Pandemic is not your classic, dog-eat-dog board game – it places its emphasis on cooperation, rather than crushing your enemies before sullying their honour with a thumb-and-finger L on the forehead. The setup, admittedly, is bleak: four diseases have ravaged the Earth, and it’s the players’ job to work together to find the cures. You may just save the world. At the very least, by leaving Monopoly languishing in the cupboard where it belongs, you’ll definitely save your family harmony.Brooklyn Nine-NineTV show, NetflixThe Lonely Island’s Andy Samberg is Jake Peralta, an affably man-childish detective in the fictional 99th precinct’s weird melting pot of eccentric coworkers, pop culture references and inept crooks. The gags come thick and fast (Google “Brooklyn Nine-Nine I Want It That Way” for an idea of what to expect) the characters are all lovable and, refreshingly, kind and content and tone never ventures beyond 12A. Plus, the majestic Terry Crews is in it. Oh, did we mention it’s funny? Well it is. Very.Mario Party SwitchGame, Nintendo SwitchFor anyone unfamiliar with the series, this is essentially a virtual board game whose cutesy wickle graphics disguise a brutal crucible of tactics, skill and white-hot rage, as you battle through its dozens of infuriating, competitive mini-games until a winner is finally crowned. You will laugh. You may cry. Be warned, though, you’ll probably also swear.Lost in SpaceTV show, NetflixA Netflix original that seems to have been buried by the critical adoration achieved by some of its stablemates, Lost in Space is a beautiful, mega-budget 4K TV production aimed squarely at the family market. The Robinson family are part of an expedition to find humanity a home beyond the stars, until all manner of problems leave them ... yep, you guessed it. Far superior to the iffy 90s film, this reboot delivers family drama, a delectably evil baddie in Parker Posey’s Dr Smith, and a giant robot saying: “Danger, Will Robinson!” And, crucially, Matt LeBlanc is nowhere to be seen.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53efb5bcbe0e31b0cd8cd53a12a39d55b697f039/1167_388_793_476/master/793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a83244ae88d43ef66f040b233427c664","title":"teens without screens one familys attempt to rein in mobile phone usage","story":"How would writer  John Lewis and his family fare when they tried to limit their mobile phone usage? We challenged him to limit his family’s mobile usage for a week. Could it bring them closer? This is his diary.SaturdayWe are sitting down to dinner, all four of us, something that only happens a few times a week. My 13-year-old son Harry has his headphones on and is giggling at a YouTube video on his phone, occasionally getting cables caught up in his fork. My 16-year-old daughter Laurie is also multitasking as she eats, scrolling through memes on Instagram and getting flecks of fish curry on her screen.This is no way to eat a meal.My wife and I once tried restricting mobile phone use. We turned off the wifi at night, but my children used their phones in bed and ate through their data allowance in a couple of days. Looking at my family, though, it’s obvious we need to address the situation again. This time, we’ll do it using the “contract” about family phone usage that Tesco Mobile has devised with family tech expert Andy Robertson.“Right,” I announce, in my best Victorian Father voice. “The entire family is going to reduce its reliance on mobiles.”After much mocking laughter, we eventually agree on some basic rules. No phones at the dinner table. We will try to limit our mobile phone use. The children won’t accept friend requests from – or talk online to – anyone they don’t know. And this time, to avoid nocturnal data problems, everyone will leave their phone in another room when it comes to bedtime.SundaySitting on the sofa, I realise that I am baffled by what my children really do while pretending to watch their favourite TV shows.“What are you actually looking at?” I ask my daughter, whose face is glued to her phone.“Just … stuff. Instagram. Tumblr. WhatsApp. I can’t actually watch TV on its own. I have to have something else to do.”“This,” says my wife, “is why I used to smoke.”To distract our children from their phones, we play board games for the evening. It actually works – although, after an hour of hilarity and excitement, the game descends into rage, bitterness and tantrums.MondayWe are on holiday abroad. Within minutes of stopping at a restaurant or museum, the children have worked out the wifi password and are busy scrolling through Instagram and watching YouTube videos.So we pledge to completely avoid phone use when out and about. For a couple of hours, this is great – they engage with the sights, photograph buildings, ask questions and patiently listen as I bluff my answers. And then we get hopelessly lost and end up having to resort to Google Maps to navigate our way around the city.TuesdayIt is evening in the holiday apartment, and we play cards. As the only games we can actually play are Snap and Go Fish, we try to learn the rules to poker. Of course, we have to look them up online, on our phones, and have to repeatedly check back on whether a flush beats a straight.WednesdayWe continue our lengthy poker session. My wife and I are surprised when my son clarifies some of the more arcane rules and then explains, in great detail, how to play a variant of poker called Texas hold ‘em. It turns out that he has been playing a Texas hold ‘em app on his phone for much of the day. We have unwittingly created a gambling expert.ThursdayThanks to this experiment making me engage with my children’s phone usage far more, I realise that I now know what my children actually do on their phones. My son plays ridiculous shoot-em-up games, discovers obscure music on Spotify and YouTube, and watches endless drumming tutorials. He is also adept at quickly looking up information to use as ammunition in an argument, making him invariably right about all sorts of things.My daughter is scrolling through endless memes on social media and watching episodes of John Oliver and Trevor Noah giggling at comedy videos about history or playing logic puzzles or quizzes on the Sporcle website.During our holiday she read an entire playscript in German on her phone. Frankly, this is a relief. My wife and I have long lived in fear that dark forces on the internet could be preying on her, so we’re far happier with the German theatre discovery.FridayThe week is now over. Cutting down on phone use has not been easy. You realise how reliant we are on them for things such as maps and basic information.But I’ve realised something: there’s no problem with this. The problem is the kind of listless, passive reliance on your mobile for the sake of it. Restricting phone use actually reminds you that the internet is quite amazing. You could be learning Italian on Duolingo, teaching yourself how to change the oil in your car using an online tutorial, reading thousands of academic papers, or watching countless arts documentaries.I pick up my phone, flick through social media and consider getting into a furious political argument with someone on Twitter. Instead, I put the phone away and start reading a book. I should do this more often.Photography: Laura McCluskey for Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084e59c09a14979e3e6a7e71feb2c5b58031320d/0_408_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65e7d4d87bf899b298d75cd53462505b","title":"experience pulled a 1500 year old sword lake saga vanecek","story":"People are saying I am the queen of Sweden because of the legend of King ArthurEvery summer, my parents, my six-year-old brother and I go to stay in a cabin by a lake called Vidöstern in Tånnö in southern Sweden, not far from where we live. I like to build sandcastles on the beach, or find rocks to skim across the water and see how many times I can make them bounce. Mamma says she used to play and swim in the lake when she was little, too.On 15 July this year, I was playing on the beach with my friend, when Daddy told me to get a buoy from the cabin: he said the water level in the lake was very shallow and we had to warn any boats that might come along because it was dangerous. He said it had been the hottest summer for 260 years.I waded into the water and it was very soft on my skin and refreshing, a little bit cool but not too cold. It was a nice feeling because the sun was shining and I was very hot. Daddy was begging me to rush so he could watch the World Cup final, but I like to take my time about things so I ignored him.I was crawling along the bottom of the lake on my arms and knees, looking for stones to skim, when my hand and knee felt something long and hard buried in the clay and sand. I pulled it out and saw that it was different from the sticks or rocks I usually find. One end had a point, and the other had a handle, so I pointed it up to the sky, put my other hand on my hip and called out, “Daddy, I’ve found a sword!”I felt like a warrior, but Daddy said I looked like Pippi Longstocking. The sword felt rough and hard, and I got some sticky, icky brown rust on my hands. It started to bend and Daddy splashed up to me, and said I should let him hold it. It was my sword and now he was taking it away! I gave it to him in the end.I ran to my mamma and my mormor – my grandma – and some other relatives who were all sitting outside having fika, which is Swedish for having a sit-down with coffee and cookies. I was yelling, “I found a sword, I found a sword!” Daddy went to show it to our neighbours, whose family has lived in the village for more than 100 years, and they said it looked like a Viking sword. Daddy didn’t get to watch the football in the end.When he showed it to an archaeologist, she said she had goosebumps and that it was at least 1,000 years old. Actually, they now think it’s 1,500 years old – from before the Vikings. She called it “sensational” and said nothing like this had ever been found in Scandinavia before, and that maybe I had found it because of the low water levels. She made me promise not to tell anyone because she and other archaeologists wanted to see if there was anything else buried in the lake they didn’t want anyone else to come and take the treasures.It wasn’t hard to keep the secret. But I did tell one of my best friends, Emmy, and now I know I can trust her because she didn’t tell anybody, except her parents – but they promised not to tell anybody else, so that’s OK.This month, the archaeologists finally came to search the rest of the lake and they found a brooch that is as old as my sword, and a coin from the 18th century. Then they announced the news and I could finally tell everyone at school. I came back from gym class and the whiteboard said, “Saga’s sword” and there were balloons, and the whole class got to have ice-cream.I had to give the sword to the local museum – Daddy explained that it’s part of history and important to share it with others. I felt “boo” that it’s gone away, but “yay” that other people will get to see it. I’m going to try to raise some money to make a replica sword that I can keep.People on the internet are saying I am the queen of Sweden, because in the legend of King Arthur, he was given a sword by a lady in a lake, and that meant he would become king. I am not a lady – I’m only eight – but it’s true I found a sword in the lake. I wouldn’t mind being queen for a day, but when I grow up I want to be a vet. Or an actor in Paris.Now, whenever I go swimming in the lake, I will be looking to see what I can find. It feels like that lake might be a little bit magic. On that day I felt a little bit magic, too.• As told to Moya SarnerDo you have an experience to share?

It’s the new shoulder pads, a sartorial norm in which structure and adornment have given way to slouch and utility. Basically, if you go out to lunch looking as if you could happily sprint 15 miles home, and defeat a foe with kick-boxing on the way, that’s good. But don’t mistake it for active wear. Active wear is when you dress for the gym, but your true intentions are coffee and a muffin. This is delusional and inauthentic, the stuff of parodic videos, the stain of that already much-derided class, the Yummy Mummy.The problem is, athleisure and active wear are really hard to tell apart. It mostly comes down to smelliness. As Jodi Kerschl, who founded Bellum (beautiful sports stuff, mainly for runners), tells me, the technology of sweat is now in a new league. “Some of the older polyester fabrics, that mesh look, were absolutely awful. Even after you’d washed it, you could still smell every odour. Performance fabrics now breathe really well.”Today, you could do a boot camp and smell premium afterwards. In extreme temperatures (running, doing hot yoga), you can genuinely tell the difference between a bra top made this year and one made in 2016. You will be too hot in either, of course but in the older one, you’ll also be sticky, maybe even sore, and definitely unhappy (this will play havoc with finding your inner stillness).The other big development is compression fabric, which slimlines the silhouette, as well as supposedly helping with muscle soreness and fatigue. You can do a lot in saggy leggings except walk around in public, when it all looks a bit pyjama-y. You’ll notice a lot of panelling in the modern legging: it has a performance element, in that it’s often a hyper-breathable fabric, but it also plays a trick on the eye and makes it look more like a trouser and less like a costume you stole from a superhero. Perfectionism has migrated from elite athletics, so that everything matters, from the position of each seam to the varying breathability of each panel whether or not it will make the average gym-goer faster, who knows? But it certainly works aesthetically.Ultimately, when it comes to buying clothes you want to do actual sport in, there are some dos and don’ts. Do buy proper sports trainers, even if they’re too bulky to pass as fashionable. Do invest in an actual tight sports bra, and do consider a proper pair of compression leggings (ideally high-waisted for comfort and support). If you’re planning on doing medium-intensity exercise, such as Zumba, then those roomy, relaxed yoga pants are a very good all-purpose purchase.Don’t bother with any of that thick, meshy, panelled stuff that looks fairly sporty, but is actually horrendously sweaty. Don’t buy high-street “sports casual” clothes – vests, or leggings, say – that don’t work as either casual or for actual sport. Don’t buy those shiny satin joggers currently all over the high street, unless they’re for a party. In which case, go, dance and be sweaty in style.If you invest in only one bit of proper technical wear, make it your underwear. Chafing at the crotch or chest is no joke."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/916ce019eabde590800754f1f758e7ad9a1da089/0_41_5615_3369/master/5615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8633958fd931049e27fcdd713bf1ea7c","title":"thank you and goodbye readers you helped make my dream come true","story":"Over four years, you have allowed me to delight in the things that give me joyIt has been my experience that endings are the hardest things to write.

At lunchtime, I push it back to the kitchen, where my wife is unloading the dishwasher.“What are you doing?” she says.“Harnessing the energy of my journey to and from work,” I say.“I’m already sorry I asked,” she says.“From now on, each time I go to my office, I push the mower there,” I say. “Whenever I return, I push it back.”“You’re allowed to help,” she says, handing me a stack of hot plates.“As long as I take a slightly different path each time, the lawn is effectively self-mowing,” I say.“And the lawnmower never gets put away ever,” she says.“Not under this new system,” I say. “Anyway, I shouldn’t even have to mow the lawn now. What happened to autumn?”“If you’re in the mood for maintenance, you could fix that,” she says, pointing to the blinking ceiling light above the oven.“You need to get Kitch for that,” I say.“Am I really going to pay an electrician to change a lightbulb?” she says.“It’s not the bulb,” I say.“How do you know?” she says.“Because that’s a new bulb,” I say.“But it’s flickering,” she says.“It’s not flickering,” I say. “It’s flashing in a precise pattern.”“What?” she says.“Look,” I say. “Blink blink blink, five-second interval, blink blink blink. It’s sending a message.”“I don’t know,” I say. “I’m not an electrician.”The next afternoon, it’s so hot in my office that I have to open the door and all the windows. I hear the squirrel crossing the roof over my head, and turn in time to see him leaping into the middle of the tomato vines.“You bastard,” I say.The next evening, I come back from the shops around sunset. “This hot weather is getting weird,” I say to my wife. “The man at the wine shop says people are buying rosé again.” My wife does not answer she is staring up at the ceiling, phone to ear, talking to Kitch.“He claims it’s not the bulb,” she says. “He says it’s a warning from space or something.”“I did not say that,” I say.“It doesn’t matter what time,” my wife says to Kitch. “You know him, he never goes anywhere.”“That’s because I work here,” I say.“Now he’s going to say he’s a businessman,” she says.“I am a businessman,” I say. I put down my bags and push the mower to my office.On Sunday night, I am woken at hourly intervals by the pounding of rain against the skylight, and again just before 6am by a piercing burglar alarm.“Is that us?” I say. I realise I’ve never heard our alarm.“It’s the school,” my wife says. The cat stands on my chest and stares at me.“I guess I’m getting up,” I say.The kitchen is cold and dark. I turn on the tap for the cat. In the garden, the mower is leaning against the house, dripping with rain. The tomato plants beyond are bare and yellowing, and the squirrel is nowhere to be seen. I stand there, arms folded, contemplating the forbidding commute ahead of me, while the light above me blinks three times, waits, then blinks again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfb49db0f3303d0a259d56ff436bc1f4d20cc3f8/5_175_3849_2310/master/3849.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4f25bde26f8c621fa149e53c58e5d0c","title":"julian assange launches legal action against ecuador","story":"WikiLeaks founder accuses government of violating his ‘rights and freedoms’Julian Assange has launched legal action against the government of Ecuador, arguing that new house rules for his stay in the country’s London embassy violate his “fundamental rights and freedoms”, his lawyers said on Friday.Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garzón, said the WikiLeaks founder was suing Ecuador’s foreign minister, José Valencia, for “isolating and muzzling” him with the new rules, which order Assange to avoid making online political comments and to take better care of his cat.“He has been held in inhuman conditions for more than six years,” Garzón said, describing the conditions regarding the cat as “denigrating”.He added Assange had not had his internet restored even though the new rules allow him to use the embassy wifi for his personal computer and phone.The move follows a deterioration in relations between the Ecuadorian government and the WikiLeaks founder, who was granted refuge at Ecuador’s London embassy in 2012 while on bail in the UK over sexual assault allegations against him in Sweden.Valencia said the country would respond to the lawsuit and that it had the “absolute prerogative and right” to protect its offices, workers and Assange himself inside its embassy.“Protocol has to be respected, whether they like it or not. It’s a norm to regulate Mr Assange’s stay in our embassy,” he told journalists, adding that the rules met with international standards and Ecuadorean laws.Garzón said the new rules had been imposed “unilaterally” and WikiLeaks had not been properly consulted about its contents.Newly-released Ecuadorian government documents this week laid bare an unorthodox attempt to extricate the WikiLeaks founder from his embassy hideaway in London by naming him as a political counsellor to the country’s embassy in Moscow.Under the new rules, Assange must obtain approval for all visitors from diplomatic staff three days in advance. He is banned from activities that could be “considered as political or interfering with the internal affairs of other states”, according to a memo seen by the .In a statement posted on Friday, WikiLeaks said Ecuador was now a “strategic ally” of the United States and there was a heightened risk of extradition for Assange.Earlier this week, US congressmen wrote an open letter to Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, which stated that to advance “crucial matters ... from economic co-operation to counter-narcotics assistance to the possible return of a USAID mission to Ecuador, we must first resolve a significant challenge created by your predecessor, Rafael Correa – the status of Julian Assange”.The Ecuadorian government partially lifted restrictions on Assange’s internet access last weekend, but stipulated he would only be allowed to use the embassy wifi for his personal computer and phone.The WikiLeaks Twitter account stated on Thursday that, “after US pressure”, moves had accelerated to strip Assange of Ecuadorian citizenship. “His citizenship status is a barrier to rendering him to another state as article 79 of Ecuador’s constitution forbids extradition of citizens,” it added.Assange was made an Ecuadorian citizen last December in an attempt by the nation’s foreign ministry to resolve the political impasse over his continued presence in the UK. The 47-year-old was naturalised after living for five-and-a-half years in the Latin American country’s cramped embassy in Knightsbridge, central London.Earlier this year, the UK Foreign Office revealed Ecuador had asked for Assange, who was born in Australia, to be accredited as a diplomat. The request was dismissed.The Ecuadorian initiative was intended to confer legal immunity on the WikiLeaks founder, allowing him to slip out of the embassy and Britain without being arrested for breaching his former bail conditions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c583dbbe3d3f32632169b74a0f3e8a6c0c90554a/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dfc953a4db46426e2353ad48f199a69","title":"pensions claim cash change jobs home","story":"People lose track of pensions when they change jobs or home – but it’s not hard to find themIs there an old pension plan out there with your name on it? A new study this week estimated there are more than £19bn of lost and forgotten pension pots waiting to be reunited with their owners, many of them worth thousands of pounds.This is typically money that people paid into a former employer’s pension scheme and then forgot about, or lost track of. The good news is, locating it is often a lot easier than you might think.Yvonne Mavin is one of those who lost track of an old pension pot. She used the government’s online Pension Tracing Service (PTS), and told  Money this week that she was “stunned” to find that the pension plan from years ago was worth £10,000.Losing track of retirement cash typically occurs when changing jobs or moving home – for example, you forget to tell the company you used to work for that you have moved to a new address. In the meantime, the firm that managed your money may have been taken over, changed names or largely shut down.The average person will have around 11 different jobs (which potentially means 11 pension pots) over their lifetime, and move home eight times.Many workers in their 20s and 30s have already worked for half a dozen or more employers. So it’s probably no wonder there are potentially about 1.6m pots worth £19.4bn lying unclaimed. That estimate comes from a study published by the Association of British Insurers, which calls it a “lost pensions mountain”.Not everyone who thinks they left behind a pension pot will actually have an entitlement, says the Pensions Advisory Service (TPAS), an independent body that is grant-aided by the Department for Work and Pensions.It adds that, as a rough rule of thumb, if you left the employer:• Before April 1975 – it is likely you will have received a refund of your pension contributions.• Between April 1975 and April 1988 – you will have a pension, provided you were over 26 and completed five years in the scheme.• After 1988 – you will be entitled to a pension, as long as you completed at least two years’ service.Step 1 Dig out all your old paperwork and see if you have details of any schemes you had forgotten about, such as an old workplace pension or personal pension. If the paperwork carries a former postal address for you, write to the scheme provider giving your current contact details.Step 2 Alternatively, or in addition, make use of some of the free-to-use official services.The Pension Tracing Service (gov.ukfind-pension-contact-details, or 0800 731 0193) and TPAS (pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk, or 0800 011 3797) can both be used to try to locate lost or forgotten workplace or personal pensions.The PTS is a free service which searches a database of schemes to try to find the contact details you need. However, you will need the name of an employer or pension provider, and the service will not tell you whether you have a pension, or what its value is.If you are struggling, give TPAS a go. It told us: “Customers contacting us as part of the pension-tracing journey will often not know which questions to ask, or which type of pension they are looking for. We can help talk through any information such as policy documents or certificates of entitlement. This often helps to tease out crucial information … In some cases, this will involve TPAS following up and searching for the lost pension if there is evidence that the customer has an entitlement.”Step 3 Once you have tracked down your pension, you may want to think about consolidating smaller pots into a single one that is easier to manage, says Tim Bennett at investment firm Killik \u0026amp Co. However, in some cases it may be better to leave a pot where it is – for example, if there are benefits you might sacrifice if you move the money.Step 4 Make sure you keep up-to-date records going forward.Mavin, who works at a London university, told Money she had held several jobs and was “semi-organised – I kept track of where I had pensions, insofar as I stuffed the correspondence in a file and forgot about it.”She adds: “Approaching retirement age, there was one pension I couldn’t track down, despite that fact that I’d managed to keep the contact details of the organisation. I was really not sure what to do next after I got the inquiry letter returned as ‘not known’.“I was aware of the Pension Tracing Service but I confess to not doing anything for ages because I thought it would be complicated and ask for lots of information I didn’t have, or didn’t understand.“When I finally made myself get round to it, it was really simple – there was a box (and I hope it still exists) that said ‘Tell us anything you think may help us in tracing your pension,’ so I just wrote in all the odd reference numbers from my documentation I didn’t understand.“I got a quick response that the organisation my pension was with originally, had been taken over by Aviva, plus contact details. And I was stunned to find out finally that it was worth £10,000 when I hadn’t even been sure it was worth the effort to try to find it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c45a1575ffcb03dbd75b2a67cf2bc445e014d24c/0_90_5897_3538/master/5897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31e78f8278aba44195bbddeedde35e2b","title":"tell us are you taking part in the peoples vote march","story":"Share your views if you plan to be in London on 20 October and tell us a little about whyThousands of people are expected to march in London on Saturday calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.Organisers of the People’s Vote March for the Future demonstration on 20 October say they hope at least 100,000 people will attend after similar numbers were seen in June.Theresa May has repeatedly rejected the idea of a second referendum on Brexit, but on Wednesday said she was open to extending the transition period in an effort to solve the Irish border issue.We would like to find out more about your views on the concept of a people’s vote and the march in London.

The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told the BBC that the government was “four weeks before the November deadline that’s been talked about”.The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, has told cabinet colleagues that November is the final realistic moment to switch to full-blown no-deal planning if the government is to be ready by next March.Ministers fear that businesses and financial markets will start betting on a no-deal outcome in the coming weeks, weighing on the pound and creating an unstable economic backdrop to the talks.Much of Tuesday’s cabinet meeting is to be devoted to Brexit. The prime minister will update colleagues on this week’s European council in Brussels, where she floated the idea of extending the transition period – during which the UK would remain subject to EU laws – to help kickstart the stalled talks.But the sticking points remain the same as they were when talks broke down last Sunday – and the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, stressed on Friday that the main obstacle to agreement was what he called the “complex” politics in Westminster.Asked whether a deal was still possible, Barnier told France Inter radio: “I have no deep conviction on this subject, because in the UK the political situation is very complex and I don’t know what decisions Theresa May will take. I hope for a deal I am working for it, because it is in our common interest.”May will have to test the wriggle room her cabinet is prepared to give negotiators over the next fortnight.Government insiders remain hopeful they can persuade EU leaders to give Barnier the green light to drop the “backstop to the backstop” – the insistence that the EU’s proposal for avoiding a hard border in Ireland must be included in the legally binding withdrawal agreement.Hunt reiterated on Friday that the government would not accept any proposal that “means the potential breakup of the United Kingdom”.Yet senior Brussels sources remain insistent that the EU’s backstop, which involves Northern Ireland alone effectively staying inside the customs union and single market, must remain in the final text.Several ministers, including Hunt, Andrea Leadsom and Michael Gove are pressing for a mechanism to be written into the backstop text to allow the UK to extricate itself, although they appear to have accepted that having a date written into the text is impossible.Hunt said: “There has to be a way that we can exit from it, and that has to be a sovereign decision of the UK parliament. What is not acceptable is that we could be indefinitely in the customs union.”The idea of extending the transition had been signed off in principle by the cabinet and also discussed and not rejected by ministers at the so-called pizza summit in Leadsom’s office on Monday night.But it infuriated some backbenchers and prompted a warning from the Scottish secretary, David Mundell, who is concerned it could mean the UK still being inside the common fisheries policy at the time of the Holyrood elections in May 2021.Outside the cabinet, May faces a growing backlash from MPs concerned about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU. Downing Street is optimistic about the negotiations on the “future framework”, but admits that only headings have been agreed, with just a few weeks left to go.Matthew Pennycook, the a shadow Brexit minister, said: “Businesses and communities across the country are crying out for clarity about what our future relationship with the EU will look like after Brexit.“If the government’s deadline for reaching a deal with the EU slips any further, then we face the very real risk of businesses implementing no-deal plans and taking investment out of the UK. We can’t have any more failed summits and missed deadlines. The Tories have got to get a grip.”If a deal is delayed until the next formal summit in December, the government may struggle to find the time to allow MPs to vote on it and pass the necessary legislation in time for March next year.Senior Conservatives warn that if the deal is to pass through the House of Commons, May will have to pivot from the cautious approach she has displayed in recent weeks to selling her deal.Meanwhile, three former cabinet secretaries, Lord Armstrong, Lord Butler and Lord O’Donnell, have hit back at Brexiters, accusing them of undermining the civil service with their constant attacks, particularly on May’s chief Brexit adviser Olly Robbins. O’Donnell told the Times the way to strike a good deal with the EU was not by “attacking our own officials”.

When you are a woman and you win the prize in physics, as the Canadian professor Donna Strickland did earlier this month, you can expect the level of attention to be overwhelming.The day after the announcement, just about everyone Strickland knew – and several people she did not, including Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada – called or emailed with congratulations. The day after that, her inbox overflowed with thousands more messages. The interview requests were similarly incessant Strickland expects to be travelling non-stop, talking at schools and scientific organisations about her work, for the next two or three years. For a self-described recluse, the frenzy was all a bit much. “Two or three weeks ago, I was an ordinary human being and now I’m not,” she says with a laugh.“Ordinary human being” is characteristic Strickland self-deprecation. Long before the Nobel bestowed its honour, the 59-year-old was considered one of the world’s foremost laser physics pioneers. The research that the Nobel committee recognised was published in 1985, when Strickland was still a doctoral student at the University of Rochester in upstate New York. Along with her supervisor and mentor Gérard Mourou (with whom she shared the Nobel), Strickland figured out a way to generate ultra-short, high-intensity laser pulses without destroying the material amplifying them. The idea was Mourou’s, she says, but “I got to make it work”.Their revolutionary technique, called chirped pulse amplification (CPA), led to the creation of small, incredibly powerful lasers now used in corrective eye surgery, industrial machining and medical imaging. (Arthur Ashkin, a US scientist, was also awarded the physics prize this year, for the development of “optical tweezers” – using light to manipulate small objects.)Before her Nobel win, Strickland’s time was split between classroom and lab, but on this day in the middle of October we are sitting in the sunnier, more interview-friendly office of the university’s chancellor. She is wearing the sensible black trousers and black shoes of a lifelong academic, a shirt with a Burberry-like pattern (it is not Burberry: “I would never spend money on that”) and thick glasses (she refuses to get the corrective surgery her work made possible: “I have great faith in lasers, but no one’s putting one near my eye”). She laughs often, speaks quickly and is unfailingly courteous – she even apologises for drinking coffee during our chat. When she talks about lasers, it is with the excitement and affection most people reserve for their pets.Strickland is only the third woman to win the Nobel in physics. The first was Marie Curie, in 1903 the second was the German-born US physicist Maria Goeppert-Mayer, who won in 1963. The fact that female scientists are so often ignored by the Nobel committee, coupled with studies that show women in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) experience more discrimination, ensured that a lot of the discussion around Strickland’s prize concerned gender. News stories drew attention to the fact that, despite having received numerous accolades before her Nobel win, Strickland was not deemed worthy of a Wikipedia page until this month (an attempt by a user to create a profile for her in March was denied by a moderator). Also highlighted was the fact that she was still an associate professor at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, rather than a full professor. It did not help that, in September, the Italian physicist Alessandro Strumia gave a conference lecture at Cern, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in which he said men were now being discriminated against because of their gender and that physics was “invented and built by men”. (Cern subsequently suspended him.)Strickland was surprised by the focus on gender. “I know there is certainly a lot of effort right now being placed on equity, ersity and inclusivity,” she says. “We consider that in our hiring practices and I’ve sat on many of the hiring committees. I was on the board of the Canadian Association of Physicists and we really discussed, as a board, how to incorporate these ideas. So, I’m certainly aware of the climate. But I don’t see myself as a woman in science. I see myself as a scientist. I didn’t think that would be the big story. I thought the big story would be the science.”Strickland’s focus has always been the science. She was born in Guelph, Ontario, a university town about an hour’s drive from Toronto. Her father was an electrical engineer and her mother was an English teacher. According to family lore, when Strickland was a child, they took a trip to the then recently opened Ontario Science Centre. Her father showed her the museum’s big laser, saying: “You’ll want to see this. Lasers are the way of the future.” Strickland barely remembers the trip, but evidently something sunk in. Later, when she enrolled as an undergraduate at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, she was torn between electrical engineering (lots of jobs) and physics (more fun). Fortunately, McMaster offered a hybrid programme – engineering physics – so she did not have to choose. Better yet, electro-optics and lasers was an area of study within the course. “I was like: ‘Oh my God, that sounds cool,’” Strickland says.When Strickland entered graduate school, the Canadian space programme was just starting up and her father often asked if she wanted to be an astronaut. No, she said, she was claustrophobic and afraid of heights – going into space sounded like a nightmare. All she wanted to do was stay in school. She was good at it, especially maths and science. When someone told her that a PhD was “the ultimate in school”, that degree became her ambition. Despite a few years on the edge of academia after Rochester, she never really left school. In 1997, she was hired by Waterloo, where she now runs the ultrafast laser group, the goal of which is, essentially, to create lasers that people have never seen before.From her first Nobel press conference onwards, Strickland has insisted that she has been treated as an equal throughout her career she has always been paid the same as her male colleagues, always been given the same opportunities. Her Nobel win is a symbol of progress, she says. Nonetheless, she has encountered men who share the defensive fragility demonstrated by Strumia in his Cern lecture. On one occasion during her undergraduate years, for example, a male student whom she had outperformed in a notoriously tough applied maths class was so furious that he threatened to “pound” her. Strickland was shocked, but also inwardly delighted: “All I could think was: ‘Girl beat you. Girl beat you bad.’”A significant obstacle for women that she highlights is the “two-body problem”. Given that men outnumber women so heavily in physics, straight women who want to marry have a much wider choice among their colleagues then straight men do. If they marry a fellow physicist, however, it becomes almost impossible for the couple to find long-term university jobs at the same time, due to the relative scarcity of academic roles. Almost always, a wife’s career is subordinated to her husband’s – which is another reason for the smaller number of women in science.Strickland would much rather talk about science than gender issues. When I ask her to describe some research she has done that is as cutting-edge as CPA, she launches into an impromptu, 10-minute lecture on a couple of experiments. I have not studied physics for about 30 years, so while I am more or less familiar with the words she uses – waveform, light, colour, intensity, pulse – her use and combination of them is baffling. She is patient, though, and almost giddy in her explanation – her eyes brighten, her smile never droops. She has said that her job is to impart her excitement about lasers to her students in these few minutes, I feel a tingle of that excitement. Strickland clearly misses the classroom. She regrets that, with all the Nobel nonsense going on, she is able to spend only about an hour a day in her lab, checking in with her group. “I’m trying my best not to abandon them,” she says. She will get back there eventually. In the meantime, there are more interviews, more photoshoots, more talks. She has to go shopping for ball gowns – three for herself, as well as ones for her daughter and her sister. There are a lot of events during Nobel week in December – balls, lectures, concerts, dinners, a meet-and-greet with the Swedish royal family. “I’ve asked a couple of other Nobel laureates for advice,” Strickland says. “They all say the same thing: ‘Pace yourself. You can only do so much.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/624188aad085530fcbc6391b1620b3c0ea2fe541/0_161_4324_2595/master/4324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1ae0ffb9dedb7a6ab0d35576713c0fc","title":"bath request toulouse replay","story":"• Club claim final whistle was blown early in the 22-20 defeat• Citings suggest Toulouse should have been down to 13 menThe Champions Cup organisers have confirmed Bath have signalled their intentions to request formally that last week’s defeat by Toulouse is replayed in what represents a remarkable course of action from the West Country club.Bath have informed European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) they want last weekend’s 22-20 defeat to be chalked off and the match played again with the competition organisers waiting on an official letter from the club before taking any decision.In an unprecedented move the club feels justified for doing so because, according to the match clock shown on television screens, there were still a few seconds to go before the referee, Andrew Brace, blew for full-time, denying Bath an attacking lineout in a promising position.Bath also believe that, because two Toulouse players – Jerome Kaino and Lucas Pointud – have since had citing complaints against them upheld, the French side should have been down to 13 men.Kaino was shown a yellow card for striking Jamie Roberts with his shoulder and has subsequently been banned for five weeks. Pointud was cited for striking Nathan Catt and has been suspended for four weeks but he stayed on the field after the incident. Toulouse for their part are appealing against Kaino’s suspension.Bath ultimately lost a thrilling contest by two points when Freddie Burns made a colossal error in failing to score the match-winning try in the dying stages. Burns had started to celebrate the try early but was caught unawares by Maxime Médard before touching the ball down under the posts. Todd Blackadder, the Bath director of rugby, has kept faith with Burns for Saturday’s Champions Cup match against Wasps and even selected him at fly-half with Rhys Priestland sidelined for up to eight weeks with a knee injury. Roberts is ruled out, however, by the head injury suffered as a result of Kaino’s tackle.Meanwhile Christian Wade is believed to be buying himself out of his Wasps contract in order to facilitate his planned pursuit of a career in NFL. News of Wade’s shock move emerged on Thursday night and, while the club has refused to confirm Wade’s departure for the US, it is believed the 27-year-old has played his last game of rugby union.A club statement released on Friday night said: “The club are aware of speculation regarding the future of Christian Wade. Unfortunately we are unable to make any comment at this time but hope to be able to provide an update in the coming days.”Wade is again absent from the Wasps team named to face Bath on Saturday and his player profile was temporarily removed from the club’s website on Friday. While Wade’s decision comes as a bolt from the blue it is believed he has been mulling it over for some time. He spent time with the renowned speed coach Steve Gonzalez, who has worked with a host of NFL players, in New Jersey over the summer and it is understood that he was approached by NFL scouts last year about a possible move.He is not the first rugby player to attempt to make the switch to NFL and he follows in the footsteps of his former England age-grade captain Alex Gray, who is currently with the Atlanta Falcons.The former Worcester lock Christian Scotland-Williamson is on the books of the Pittsburgh Steelers.Ben Te’o has given Eddie Jones a boost after he was named on Worcester’s bench for their Challenge Cup match against the Ospreys n Saturday. Te’o has been sidelined since missing England’s summer tour of South Africa with quadriceps and calf injuries but is set for a first appearance of the season before Jones takes his autumn internationals squad to Portugal next week for a warm-weather training camp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0a57bc6a41695aaf2953cd08a6cb52e8c3e44d8/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dc4d3899ffc528d8d6189b2a920d3d8","title":"leicester scarlets rugby champions cup match report","story":"Leicester and England have both been waiting a long time for a rejuvenated Manu Tuilagi and finally the big man is back.With his national coach, Eddie Jones, in attendance, the fit-again centre chose the perfect night to produce his most compelling display of the season and help the Tigers secure the bonus-point victory they required to revive their European campaign.By the end there was no need to refer this particular Champions Cup contest to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Tigers scored five tries in all, with Tuilagi sealing a man-of-the-match performance by powering over for his side’s crucial fourth after 64 minutes. With Jonny May also proving his fitness with a try following his recent shoulder knock and George Ford contributing 20 classy points, it was a most welcome night for Jones with the autumn Tests looming.Among those who also enjoyed their evening was Dan Cole, pointedly omitted from England’s squad for next month’s internationals, but ultimately this was a result for everyone at Leicester to cherish. Not only did it maintain their record of never having lost at home to Welsh opposition in this tournament it also yielded an overdue victory after five straight European defeats.The Tigers, who had trailed by two points entering the final quarter, still have to find a way past Racing 92 in Pool 4 but, after a sticky start to the domestic season, their late surge delighted their interim head coach, Geordan Murphy.Murphy was also encouraged by his forwards’ improved showing, particularly as his club captain, Tom Youngs, withdrew through illness just before kick-off. Any coach would love to have a fully-firing Tuilagi at his disposal and Murphy thinks England will soon feel the benefit as well. “He gets better every week,” said the former Ireland full-back. “The way he played tonight you’d think he’s got a shot at getting selected. That try was world-class.”Murphy also believes Cole’s international career is far from finished – “He’d be one of my first bodies on the team sheet” – having seen his team start and finish the game like the Tigers of old. After eight minutes they were already 10-0 up via a Ford penalty and an eighth-minute converted try from the lock Harry Wells, only for the Scarlets to hit back strongly. Even their tight forwards can give and take a slick pass and, after an attempted chip over the top by Ford had fallen into Scarlets’ hands, Wyn Jones and David Bulbring combined to put Gareth Davies away for a fine score.In addition to Leigh Halfpenny’s conversion and subsequent penalty, Scotland’s new back-row addition Blade Thomson came within inches of another try, the ball just bobbling from his grasp as he slid towards the line and Leicester’s supporters were mightily relieved when the busy Guy Thompson dotted down in the left corner to restore the home lead. Halfpenny still had time to drill over another penalty to make it 15-13 at the break and set up an intriguing second-half.Even without the injured Rhys Patchell, Aaron Shingler and Jake Ball, the Scarlets visibly fancied their chances of raiding the Tigers’ lair for the first time in their European history. But they reckoned without Leicester re-emerging as the sharper side. Another Ford penalty was followed by a 47th-minute close-range try for the onrushing Sione Kalamafoni to give the Tigers a 25-13 cushion. Once again, though, the visitors swiftly found a way back into the contest, a clever inside ball from Gareth Davies sending Steff Evans through the narrowest of gaps.When Ben Youngs’ attempted clearance failed to find touch, allowing Ken Owens to send the electric Davies clear and put Thomson over for the visitors’ third converted score, a grandstand finish loomed. Much to Leicester’s relief it was to prove merely a temporary blip, Tuilagi and May burying any chance of a Welsh triumph.The Scarlets, having been defeated in both their opening two pool games, already have it all to do to reach the last eight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4fa12b9c68ddd83219cb46daeb7a11ca7af0bfb/0_56_4851_2912/master/4851.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fd3dd524ddf64d6ee6eab4876c8cf1f","title":"lewis hamilton fastest wet us grand prix practice f1","story":"The second practice session in rainy Austin looked set to be a damp squib until Lewis Hamilton emerged for a 10-minute period that underlined why he is poised to win his fifth Formula One title at a circuit he routinely dominates.With the surface sodden and slow it looked doubtful that Hamilton would even leave the garage. But with only a few minutes left on Friday he immediately set the fastest lap by a second, three seconds better than his title rival, Sebastian Vettel.“You know when you tell me to go steady I’m not going to go steady,” the 33-year-old said on the team radio as he briskly returned to the pits.Moments after that statement of intent it emerged that the stewards had imposed a three-place grid penalty on Vettel, nudging the world champion closer to the title.Hamilton was also fastest during opening practice by about 1.3 seconds ahead of his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas, with Vettel down in fifth in his Ferrari.Vettel’s punishment for his latest error just as Hamilton demonstrated his superiority felt telling before Sunday’s race.The German was summoned to see the stewards after failing to slow sufficiently during a red flag period in the first practice to allow for gravel to be cleared off the track. While consistent with previous rulings for similar offences, the outcome threatens to decrease the drama on Sunday.A best-case scenario for Vettel will see him qualify in fourth, but to keep his faint title hopes alive he can ill afford to finish below Hamilton.Vettel criticised the decision. “I think I slowed down, I had a good look around at what was going on. The rules are clear so we know,” he told reporters.” It is the first time we had this in the wet, where the target is a lot slower.”After several days of heavy rain that have caused severe flooding in towns west of Austin, the surface at the Texan capital’s circuit was slippery under granite, drizzly skies during first practice.Hamilton has been at pains this week to stress the importance of avoiding complacency. “The weather is up and down, our goal is really just to perform as we have in previous races, we’re not thinking of it in any other way,” he said.Pictured standing outside the Nasdaq site in Times Square earlier this week for a photo opportunity, Hamilton currently looks a far more reliable bet than the stock market.He is 67 points clear of Vettel with four races remaining and since the summer has been in form as imperious as the Ferrari driver’s has been indifferent.Hamilton’s triumph at Suzuka on 7 October was his sixth win in the past seven races and he has won the past four in Austin.Aware that most of the US is largely unaware or uninterested, the US Grand Prix’s pop concerts are promoted almost as heavily as the race itself. For many spectators the event is defined not by Hamilton or Vettel but singers such as Taylor Swift and Justin Timberlake.This year Britney Spears and Bruno Mars will perform on a large stage between turn 11 and turn 12. “We want people to understand that F1 is entertainment in the broadest sense,” Sean Bratches, F1’s commercial managing director, said in an interview for the official F1 newsletter.Lando Norris, the Bristol-born 18-year-old who will make his race debut in 2019, was 12th fastest for McLaren in first practice as he stood in for Stoffel Vandoorne."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1023c68f846a0c792e49c850e79e1067f39e77c5/0_86_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9428177245a5399f3764380b96daf3b8","title":"lizzie deignan interview motherhood cycling return","story":"There are three of us in this interview, and in the best of ways. As Lizzie Deignan details her pregnancy and her hopes and plans for her cycling future from a half-complete house in Yorkshire, her new-born daughter Orla is cooing and chirping in that engaging way newborns have. She is, Deignan tells me, very calm, does not cry much, “not much fazes her”, and at four weeks she appears to be taking this little episode in her stride.Three years after winning the road race world championships in Richmond, Philadelphia, with her 30th birthday on the horizon, Deignan has taken on a different challenge, with the support of her husband Philip, 35, and a new team, Trek-Segafredo: doing it all again as a mother, with the goal of more world championship success when the title race comes to her home roads next year, and that elusive Olympic gold medal in Tokyo a year later.Deignan kept fans up to date with her pregnancy through Instagram, but relished the quiet of the period out of racing that followed her announcement in March. “Personally and professionally it’s been a nice year away from the pressures of sport. It’s made me realise how lucky I am to do what I do. I’d got stale and felt I was just going through the motions, so I’m pleased to have a second chance of approaching my career.”The decision to come back to racing after the birth of her daughter came early in her pregnancy. She had hitherto assumed motherhood would be “an all-encompassing thing, that when you became a mother that should be your sole focus. I had no plan to come back afterwards, but about a month in I realised that was what I wanted to do, and that I might be capable of doing both, and that it might inspire other women.“It’s a genuine motivation. As an athlete you have to promote stuff, communicate about things, but this is different. I just genuinely feel you should encourage people to try to have it all.”Deignan kept riding until three days before Orla’s birth on 24 September, and was intrigued to discover what she could do so late into her pregnancy. “The first three months were the hardest because of morning sickness and tiredness, but I’d have laughed if you had told me I would keep riding until then. It was good for my physical and mental health, keeping moving was important, keeping the swelling down. Every woman is different but I was surprised by what we are capable of.”Presenting her Lizzie x Santini clothing range at the recent CycleExpo in Harrogate was a rare public outing for the 2012 London silver medallist. She has no set date in her head for a return to racing, which is deliberate, to ensure that she does not put herself under pressure. “I wanted to be cautious, because the goal is the Yorkshire Worlds. I haven’t got to race until June so I’ve got a good amount of time, although it’s possible it may be earlier.”That date has been agreed with Trek-Segafredo, who stepped in after Deignan left her long-time team Boels-Dolmans in the spring following the announcement of her pregnancy. “All I have had from Trek about my comeback is positive enthusiasm, there is no judgment on me as a mother. They thought it was an excellent opportunity and it would encourage other mothers to ride their bikes.”Trek will be run alongside the men’s WorldTour team of the same name. It is not a novelty, but it is increasingly the norm, with Movistar and FDJ recently following the early adopter Sunweb. Some say it should be obligatory for all WorldTour teams, but Deignan is not sure. “It shouldn’t be the only model, because there are standalone women’s teams doing a great job. But we are lucky to have the infrastructure of the men’s team, so we can use that without needing a huge budget.”It is unclear as yet how she and her husband will manage childcare, largely because his future is currently more uncertain than his wife’s. “The original plan was that he would keep racing as well, but men’s racing is having a turbulent time. He’s looking for a contract but he may end up as a full-time dad as his next career move. We’ve looked into other arrangements such as childcare and we’re ready for both options.”Deignan’s big target for 2019 is 11 months away, when Yorkshire, the county where she was born, hosts the world road race championships. The course, she says, is, “awesome”.She adds: “If I could design a circuit like the one in Harrogate, it would be like that. There are two bottlenecks, chicanes, you come down both descents on to humpback bridges over a stream and back up the other side of the valley. It’s very hard, very good, with lots of places to launch attacks. It’s great for racing.”She has few concerns about the scale of what she is taking on. “I have no doubt it will be a serious challenge but I’m excited by that. I wasn’t very happy with my racing before, if you are winning you are expected to be happy but I’d fallen out of love with it. Now I have a second chance to enjoy it.“I’d rather try and fail than not try. I’m absolutely prepared to fail but I will have to decide what failure is. I’ve not really considered it.“I’ve got two years to do it, and so far I’ve only surprised myself. If the worst happens and I don’t win bike races I’ve got Orla, so it won’t be a big deal.”For now, she is waiting until what feels the right moment to get back on two wheels she is determined not to rush into it. “I’m looking forward to my first ride. I feel very balanced about it. I love Orla to bits but I’m sure I’ll be fine for an hour on the bike.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4751821085070709fe2f04eae8390d9ff57afa1c/126_416_3732_2240/master/3732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3237e17ae5f28a2abfb0641c5afcea8d","title":"talking horses racing tips ascot champions day cracksman","story":"Soft ground will once more be a main factor in the calculations of every punter on Champions Day, Ascot having taken 40mm of rain last weekend. Conditions are likely to be against one, two or perhaps even three of the favourites to be fielded by John Gosden on this card but they are no obstacle to Cracksman (3.50), who can shore up his reputation in the Champion Stakes.Some cutting things have been said about this four-year-old since his defeat at Royal Ascot, partly inspired by Gosden’s seeming reluctance to return him to the track. The fitting of blinkers does not exactly inspire confidence.But the fact remains that he has won two top-class races this year. True, 10 furlongs on fast ground exposed the limits of his speed when he was last seen still, there was no disgrace in being bested by Poet’s Word, who won the King George next time, and the likelihood is that Cracksman remains a serious talent. He will be fresher here than Crystal Ocean and perhaps that may also help.1.25 Long Distance Cup As was noted this week by Timeform, it’s half a century since the Gold Cup winner completed a full season undefeated. Straarius could achieve that feat here, having won all four races since reappearing in the Yorkshire Cup in mid-May, but there must be some concern that the flashy chestnut does not really want such a testing surface. He coped fairly well to be third last year when he was getting the three-year-old allowance from the first two but was still a bit below his best and may be vulnerable again. Flag Of Honour’s best form has also been on a sounder surface, so perhaps Sir Erec is the way to go, for all that he seems Aidan O’Brien’s second string. A scopey type, he was really impressive in a Listed race on bad ground at Limerick last weekend, finishing powerfully after being trapped behind a wall of rivals.2.00 Sprint Stakes It’s asking a lot for a horse to win both Haydock’s Sprint Cup in September and this race the following month, for all that they are very similar races. No horse has done the double since Ascot’s Champions Day was created, though placed horses from Haydock have won here. With that in mind, Brando must be of interest at roughly double the odds of The Tin Man, who beat him by half a length in the Haydock race. A Group One winner in France last year, Brando has had another fine year, having also been second in the July Cup. He is ridden for the first time in years by Jamie Spencer, poor Tom Eaves having broken a leg since his last race.2.40 Fillies and Mares Stakes As with Straarius, there must be a concern about Lah Ti Dar’s ability to cope with this surface, which is radically different from anything she has so far encountered. That by itself would stop me from taking a short price about her, but there are also some interesting, improving sorts ranged against her. Kitesurf is just about the pick and, although she must also prove herself on soft, her odds offer more margin for error than the favourite’s. There was a lot to like about the way she ran down Magic Wand in France last month and her run style suggests the mud may help her by slowing up those ahead of her in the first mile. Aidan O’Brien fields six and his Broadway is priced up as a no-hoper but this half-sister to Danedream has been crying out for this distance and could run into a place.3.15 QEII Stakes Once again, punters will be offered short odds about a John Gosden runner for whom soft ground is not ideal. Distance is also a factor for Roaring Lion, who steps down to a mile, having been beaten in his last three races at that distance. At least that means he will avoid the worst of the ground, on the round course, and perhaps he is classy enough to win anyway, but I would rather bet that one of his 14 rivals can mug him. Happily will do for me, having won back to back Group Ones on deep ground last autumn. She went down by just a head to Laurens a fortnight ago, when her rival had the rail to help her, and this softer ground may help her to an even better performance. 4.30 Balmoral Handicap A disappointing favourite at Haydock last month, Mitchum Swagger may have needed that first run for half a year and the drying ground was against him. A good third behind Addeybb in the Lincoln, he would at least go close here if able to reproduce that effort on just his third run since joining Ralph Beckett."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e27444113a10ef559f6aabbfde53c11c12afd75/0_34_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c98dbc61101f95506f49ceb14e4c267","title":"sri lanka v england fourth odi live","story":"46th over: Sri Lanka 229-6 (Perera 30, Akila 8) Perera tries to flay a wide one from Stone over point, but doesn’t time it and picks up two where he might have got double that. Akila chips over wide mid-wicket but again only for two: all well and good, but Sri Lanka could do with some boundaries - none since that assualt by Shanaka at the back end of the 42nd over. 45th over: Sri Lanka 223-6 (Perera 27, Akila 5) Akila plays a weird shot, trying to ramp a slow bouncer over the keeper, but it ends up nearer fine leg, and it has enough pace only for a single. There are four more, less interesting singles from the over, and a near run-out as Morgan goes whisker close with a throw from the covers. 44th over: Sri Lanka 218-6 (Perera 24, Akila 3) Perera puts one straight up in the air, but it lands exactly - but exactly - in the middle of three converging fielders. Hales then throws the ball in to nobody, but Sri Lanka miss out on an overthrow because Perera was dozingcontemplating the enormity of existence. Morgan gives away a single with some careless fielding at point. Not the best cricket in that over, all told. 43rd over: Sri Lanka 213-6 (Perera 22, Akila 0) A proper kick in the pants that. If Shanaka had stayed in Sri Lanka would have been looking at high 200s, but now...Oh boy. Just as Shanaka was starting to loosen his shoulders, some brainless running sees him gone. And it was his fault too, charging up the track after Perera hit a leading edge more or less straight to Morgan in the covers. The England skipper flips the ball to Woakes, who throws down the stumps and Shanaka is a foot or so short trying to get back. He just seemed incredibly slow to hear the screamed “NO” shout from Perera. 42nd over: Sri Lanka 212-5 (Shanaka 66, Perera 21) Stone is here for his first bowl since the eighth over. He starts with a wide down leg, then sends another the same route. Perera goes for a big drive but only gets a thick edge down to third man for a single. Then Shanaka throws the sink, the dishwasher, the waste disposal unit, fridge and anything else he can find from the kitchen at a length ball, sending it way over cow corner. After a third wide of the over, Shanaka takes him deep again, this time straight. 17 runs from a nine ball over: exactly what Sri Lanka need, but file under ‘not ideal’ for England. 41st over: Sri Lanka 195-5 (Shanaka 53, Perera 20) Woakes in again. Perera tries to open his arms and go for the big inside-out shot over the covers, but doesn’t get all of it and it just drops safe with Olly Stone in the postcode. Buttler drops one after Perera wafts outside off: don’t think there was an edge there, but chances are Woakes would be too polite to mention it if there was. 40th over: Sri Lanka 190-5 (Shanaka 51, Perera 17) And there’s another, Shanaka jumping all over a short one from Stokes and slapping it with extreme prejudice to the square leg fence. Then after a couple of plays-and-misses, he goes to 50 by battering a cover drive just wide of mid-off. 39th over: Sri Lanka 181-5 (Shanaka 42, Perera 17) Bowling change, and it’s Chris Woakes back with the ball. Shanaka takes a step or two down the pitch, waits for the slower ball and with a lovely flourish and dainty flick of his back leg, whacks the ball wide of mid-off and to the boundary. He’s batted well, but again having taken 53 balls for his 42 runs, he’ll need plenty more of those shots to justify the time taken over setting the base. 38th over: Sri Lanka 175-5 (Shanaka 37, Perera 16) Perera absolutely nails a back-of-a-length ball from Stokes, middling a cross-batter straight back down the pitch, a shot that would have brained umpire Lyndon Hannibal had he not ducked at just the right time. A slower ball slips out of Stokes’s hand a little, but Perera can’t take full advantage of the full toss. 37th over: Sri Lanka 166-5 (Shanaka 36, Perera 8) Shanaka scandalises anyone with Victorian sensibilities, as either by accident or design his left trouser leg is scrunched up behind his pad, EXPOSING his calf muscle. Someone fan me down, all this flesh on display. The cricket action isn’t nearly as thrilling in that over, just three singles coming from it. 36th over: Sri Lanka 163-5 (Shanaka 35, Perera 6) Stokes doesn’t escape the wide call this time, one really no higher than the ball in his last over getting the airplane arms. Then a classic overcorrection, going straight and full but too full, Perera flicking the half-volley between mid-wicket and mid-on, to the boundary.35th over: Sri Lanka 156-5 (Shanaka 34, Perera 1) Despite comfortably taking that catch, Buttler has been having some problems with his left hand. Could just be the large amounts of taping keepers tend to have, could be some pain in his thumb, but this is the second time in the last half hour or so he’s removed his glove for some attention. Still, he’s all taped up and ready to go now. Last time out Perera smacked his first ball up in the air, but on this occasion rather more sensibly takes a single off his hip. Curran drifts onto De Silva’s pads and he duly flicks a boundary down to the fine-leg boundary, but that’s a brief moment of batting satisfaction. He plays a profoundly odd shot, shuffling down the pitch before realising the ball wasn’t as full as he would’ve liked, but reacts by just absently jabbing at it. The feather edge carries through to Buttler. 34th over: Sri Lanka 150-4 (De Silva 13, Shanaka 33) Here’s Ben Stokes, on point straight away with a short one that hops up and Shanaka just avoids edging. Then he gets away with an even shorter one, high and down leg side, not called a wide for reasons passing understanding. Shanaka breaks a run of 13 balls without a run by dabbing carefully to third man for a single, De Silva pushes another out to the sweeper but that’s still only three runs from the last three overs. Easier said, etc and so forth, but they need to get a wriggle on. 33rd over: Sri Lanka 148-4 (De Silva 12, Shanaka 32) Deciding not to score runs off Rashid’s final over is fine, but it does mean Sri Lanka have to give the quicks some tap. Easier said than done when Curran is keeping things tight: that’s a maiden, which in the 33rd over of a limited overs game in 2018 is...unusual. 32nd over: Sri Lanka 148-4 (De Silva 12, Shanaka 32) Here’s Rashid in for his final over. And the batsman just look like they want it out of the way, barely playing a shot so there’s a only a single from it. Rashid ends with 10-0-36-1. 31st over: Sri Lanka 147-4 (De Silva 11, Shanaka 32) Back to pace for England now, and it’s Tom Curran. Interesting that Stokes hasn’t bowled yet: Morgan may well be saving him for the last overs now that he only has one frontline spin over left. Morgan nips round from cover and throws the stumps down as they go for a quick single, but De Silva was in fairly comfortably. After a loose first two, that’s a tight comeback over from Curran, only two runs from it. 30th over: Sri Lanka 145-4 (De Silva 10, Shanaka 31) Shanaka goes BIG off Rashid, a top-edged slog-sweep going high in the air. Hales is underneath it, but misjudges his feet: he stopped a couple of steps before the boundary, not realising he had more room, the ball bursts through his hands and over the rope for six. Had he taken one or two steps back, which he had room for, he might well have taken a comfortable catch. 29th over: Sri Lanka 138-4 (De Silva 10, Shanaka 24) Mo is bowling through, he begins his final over, which is a bit ragged, featuring two legside wides. Still, not as ragged as my attempt to complete the ostensibly straightforward task of drinking tea: my plain blue t-shirt is now no longer plain. Mo ends with 10-0-55-2. Solid stuff. 28th over: Sri Lanka 131-4 (De Silva 7, Shanaka 22) Rashid on for his eighth over, and he succeeds in stemming this nascent assault, keeping Sri Lanka to a pair of singles. 27th over: Sri Lanka 129-4 (De Silva 6, Shanaka 21) Sri Lanka getting on with it now: De Silva cuts nicely to the cover fence for a boundary, then if Shanaka nailed that six in the last over, he nails this one, waaaaaaaay over cow corner. 12 from the over, and these two have decided that messing around is not an option. 26th over: Sri Lanka 117-4 (De Silva 1, Shanaka 14) Bosh! Shanaka shifts his left leg out of the way and launches one over mid-on, dropping just over the ropes for the first six of the innings. Maybe he’s going for a death or glory approach. It’s nearly death next up, as a running mix-up leaves De Silva stranded, and only a bad throw from Buttler to the bowler’s end saves them from a comical run-out. 25th over: Sri Lanka 110-4 (De Silva 1, Shanaka 7) Turn all over the shop here, but Shanaka gets himself four runs with a beautifully executed reverse sweep, zooting through third man to the boundary. These two have bowled 14 overs on the bounce now. 24th over: Sri Lanka 103-4 (De Silva 0, Shanaka 1) Rashid greets Shanaka with an absolutely sensational leg break, the sort the batsman just has to shove his bat at, close his eyes and hope for the best. The best in this case was the ball turning safely past the outside edge. House of cards time now: the collapse is on. Mendis goes back to a length ball from Rashid, it strikes him in front of middle-leg and the finger goes up. Could have been a bit high but the review was burned three balls earlier, and Mendis has to slink off. 23rd over: Sri Lanka 102-3 (Mendis 5, De Silva 0) Oh mercy! De Silva, for reasons best known to him, decides to dance down the track to his first ball, runs past it but Buttler drops the ball and can’t complete a simple stumping. That actually hit Dickwella on the elbow, but that still counts. The review suggests the ball was heading for the top of middle, and Dickwella is gone. Dickwella goes for the sweep again, misses, and it looks very lbw. Only doubt might be how far he was down the pitch when struck. He goes upstairs just in case...22nd over: Sri Lanka 100-2 (Dickwella 51, Mendis 4) Sun! There’s sun! It’s sunny! First time we’ve seen that for a while.

Which will weigh heavier at the ballot box in crucial midterm elections for House, Senate and governor?When I checked in at Heathrow for my flight to Racine, the woman helping me tag my bags asked the purpose of my journey. When I told her I was going to cover the midterm elections she asked: “Do you think it’ll make any difference? He just does what he wants.”Then she leaned in conspiratorially and whispered: “I think he’s mad.”When I later told the American immigration officer at Chicago O’Hare about my plans, he sighed: “Oh, it’s time for that circus again!” and waved me through. At the car rental counter, the assistant just laughed. “I won’t tell you what I think,” she said, shaking her head. “I’m not sure I even have the words.”The 90-minute drive from O’Hare to Racine is a straight run from suburb to farmland from Illinois (“Land of Lincoln”) to Wisconsin (“America’s Dairyland”) until you reach the county road and then head east past fields of pumpkin and corn to Lake Michigan. Racine sits on the western banks of the lake – a former manufacturing town which, at first sight, seems to have managed better than most such places. Evidence of its post-industrial status abounds in former factory buildings and manufacturing sites but many have been repurposed. Downsized but not derelict, it’s a rust belt town without too much rust.“It’s a working-class town where there’s not a lot of work,” says Angelina Cruz, a teacher and union organiser. “And the work there is tends to be service work that doesn’t pay well and doesn’t have great benefits.”“We have two Racines,” says Kelly Gallaher, a retired teacher. “We have a beautiful place to live and wonderful, wonderful people. We’re 25 minutes from Milwaukee and an hour on the train from Chicago. We have great ersity. But when you look under it you see that there are problems we’re not addressing.“You can find yourself a job, but it’ll pay $9 an hour and at the same time there’s no housing to buy and no housing to rent. Wisconsin has the worst achievement gap between black and white children in the country and Racine is up there in the top three cities within Wisconsin.”Over the summer Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) launched a series of raids that led to detention of several local people, including Ricardo Fierro, the former local director of the Hiic Chamber of Commerce and member of the City of Racine mayoral advisory board.Racine faces three elections, all of which have national interest. The current congressman is the Republican House speaker, Paul Ryan: he is stepping down and Democrats have an outside chance of taking his seat. In a year with a record number of female candidates two women, Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir, are running for the Senate. Baldwin, the sitting Democratic senator, appears to have a strong lead, but Republicans have not yet given up. And in the governor’s race the Republican Scott Walker, whose attacks on public sector workers over the past eight years made him a poster boy for conservatives and a hate-figure for progressives, is in an extremely tight race. Bernie Sanders is coming to campaign in nextdoor Kenosha next week Donald Trump will be holding a rally a few hours away too.But during the drive through the county and into the city there are very few yard signs in the city there are not many posters. It may well be that people are momentarily captivated by the fate of the Milwaukee Brewers in the playoffs, but three weeks from election day the political intensity of the last two years is not immediately apparent.Midterm elections are strange affairs. Votes to the lower house (the House of Representatives) and a third of the upper house (the Senate) can have a considerable impact on how much of a president’s agenda can be achieved. But they are far more low key than presidential contests. The turnout is always lower and interest slower to catch on. I recall asking people on the Las Vegas Strip their thoughts the weekend before the 2006 midterms and discovering most didn’t know they were even happening.But the only way you could avoid them in Racine is if the only things you watched were streamed through the likes of Netflix or Amazon Prime. Regular TV is awash with ads. Most are negative. In the local race, James Bryce tells people not to vote for his Democratic brother Randy, which has prompted their mother to call for the ad to be taken down. At the governor level, Walker’s supporters are running ads criticizing his opponent for not revoking the license of a teacher caught watching porn on his school computer. One ad focuses in on a teenage girl’s chest and refers to oral sex while featuring school students.In a recent campaign call, local Republican activists were told the races were extremely close and there was everything to play for. Democrats have been told the same thing. But burned by Donald Trump’s election in the state – Wisconsin had not voted Republican since 1984 and nobody I have spoken to saw it coming even as they were campaigning on the day – and their failed attempts to get rid of Walker, Democrats dare not hope too much. Anecdotally, they sense people are more engaged than they can remember since Obama’s election. Emotionally, thanks to recurring disappointments, they have ceased to fully trust their senses.“I’ve been doing this every cycle since 2006,” says Gallaher, a Democrat. “The closer you get to election day it starts to tighten and it gets closer and closer, and when it comes down to it Republicans will turn out and Democrats won’t. My hope is that all the things that have happened over the last two years will make a difference and bring people out. But having been active as long as I have in Wisconsin, I can’t afford the luxury of hope any longer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

But hurdles remain before the change can be formalised.A referendum on the agreement several weeks ago failed to pass the turnout threshold of 50 percent, leaving it up to the Skopje parliament to settle the issue.The procedure to complete constitutional changes is lengthy and requires several rounds of voting, with Friday’s being just the first stage. The procedure should be completed by January at the latest.“Today is a historic day for the country,” Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said. “Macedonia will be part of the European family our dreams and visions for better life in a better country will be fulfilled.”Once Macedonia formally changes the constitution, the Greek parliament will also have to vote on the deal.Defence Minister Panos Kammenos, who heads a small right-wing party that props up the government in the legislature, has threatened to quit the coalition if the Greek vote goes ahead.“A great day for democracy in Skopje,” Johannes Hahn, the EU’s commissioner in charge of enlargement, wrote on his Twitter account.Russia and the US have traded allegations of interfering in Macedonia’s affairs.Last month Washington accused Moscow of running a disinformation campaign to sour the public on the deal ahead of a referendum on the changes.Russia, which opposes Macedonia’s NATO aspirations, on Thursday fired back.“There is a continuation of the crudest interference of the US and EU in Skopje’s internal affairs, the level of which has already surpassed conceivable boundaries,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement."},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days offer prospective students a unique opportunity to sample life on campusWhat you need to know to make sure you take full advantage of your open day opportunityOpen days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will be"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660278.1539269071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit the truck driver and 20 tonnes of frozen chicken","story":"Simon Carswell travels with truck driver Stephen Heasley to find out how post-Brexit customs checks could affect food supplies. Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:   ReutersClodagh KilcoyneThe 2018 presidential election campaign is often compared to the campaign of seven years ago. But for a more appropriate comparison, go back another seven years to 2004.Of course there was no election back then. No candidate emerged to challenge Mary McAleese, so she was re-elected unopposed. But her playbook, and the narrative of what ensued in that non-election, are uncannily similar to what has been happening this time round, right down to it being a non-election.For one, the iron law of incumbency applies to this largely titular role more than any other public position in Irish life. Not only is the president above politics, he or she is seemingly above criticism as well.McAleese waited until the last minute (September 2004) before confirming an interest in the second term. It left any challenger at a disadvantage, having little time to mount an effective campaign.For the potential contenders, it was all over. Eamon Ryan of the Green Party indicated he was interested in running but could not muster support outside his own party. Dana Rosemary Scallon sought backing from four councils but only got one, Galway. An environmental campaigner, Vincent Salafia, also got nowhere.Interestingly, then Labour leader Pat Rabbitte started to make encouraging noises about the Green Party’s Ryan, suggesting his party might just back him. But Labour already had a ready-to-go and willing candidate in the wings. But that candidate could not get the backing of its executive council, failing by a single vote. His supporters questioned whether it was appropriate for a president to stay in the Áras for 14 years. And who was the disappointed politician?None other than Michael D Higgins.In 2004, a commentator, obviously with a cracked crystal ball, summed up his fate thus: “Poor Michael D. With a wilted spirit and precious little fire left in his belly, it was a sad and turbulent day as he came to terms with the reality that he is highly unlikely ever to be taking up position in some cosy little nook at Áras an Uachtaráin.”Now, 14 years later, he’s replaying the McAleese playbook from setting the agenda to laying down the rules of engagement.Higgins is a well-liked President but his popularity never really soared like McAleese. There are a couple of questions that have nibbled at the public consciousness: his promise to serve only one term his age and (more recently) expenses, costs and value-for-money questions about his office.How do you characterise the nature of the contest between the incumbent and his rivals? The closest comparison you could think of was the match between the Dublin senior footballers and TG4’s the Underdogs in Parnell Park on Friday night.Here was a proven All-Ireland champion up against rivals who had never stood for public office in their lives or had pulled on a county jersey in championship politics. The exception was Liadh Ní Riada of Sinn Féin but she has only been a MEP for four years, making her a relative novice.To compound the difficulties, three of them were panellists from Dragon’s Den, each diluting each other’s appeal. You could sense Gavin Duffy’s frustration when he announced that he had no idea that the other two would be in the field. Besides, would Seán Gallagher’s pro-business message from seven years ago butter any parsnips now?Each of the candidates produced positive, worthy and (at times) novel political platforms. Senator Joan Freeman had impressive ideas on how the Áras could be used to promote better mental health, wellness, mindfulness and less digital dependency.But her problem – and that of her fellow candidates – is that the nature of these contests isn’t to discover a candidate’s ideas but to uncover his or her potential flaws.This campaign has not been as savage – yet, at least – as seven years ago but no candidate has been left unscathed. Freeman has spent at least half her time defending a loan she got from an American businessman, whose company was investigated for pyramid selling.Duffy, meanwhile, was reminded of a serious accident for which he was at fault 40 years ago Gallagher was quizzed about where he has been for the past seven years Ní Riada was asked about the HPV vaccine and the inadequacy of the Sinn Féin in apology to sexual-abuse victim Máiría Cahill.From the start, Higgins had his hand on the tiller. His presidential diary was unusually busy this summer compared to other summers, galvanising an already high profile. He also was able to control the number of broadcast debates he was involved in to just three. The decision by Gallagher not to participate in debates not involving all six played into Higgins’ hands. Instead of one glaring absentee, there were two missing candidates and that mitigated any PR damage it might do to Higgins.And there was little surprise on Wednesday when The  Ipsos MRBI poll showed Higgins at almost 70 per cent, more than 50 per cent clear of his nearest rival. This wasn’t a contest. This was a procession.The paradox of this non-contest is that the thrust of the campaign this week has centred around the candidate with the least public profile, Peter Casey. Did he introduce the comments about Travellers as a deliberate strategy? Probably not. The unfiltered nature of his comments is reminiscent of the US president Donald Trump. Instead of resiling, he doubled-down, and was accused of racism. It all came to a head on Thursday with a surreal visit (accompanied by a posse of media and gardaí­) to Cabra Bridge in Co Tipperary to view the unoccupied housing estate, which formed the core of his argument. The ruse backfired. He declined to meet the local family whom he had accused of being selfish. And then they arrived on site to make impassioned defences, accusing him of racism.Casey has found it hard to move on from this issue. On Friday morning he issued a statement saying he was taking the weekend off to consider whether or not he would stay in the race.Higgins has come under some pressure this time, no more so than on the unaudited expenses allowance of €317,000 per annum. He has supplied some figures in relation to them but has refused to release full details until after the election. Opacity in the Áras is a big issue and there is little evidence that anything was done to address it during the President’s first term.The other line he has repeated ad infinitum is that he has been taking part in debates since 1969 and has never shirked from the challenge. But the reality – dictated by him – in this contest is that he has not been taking part in (all) debates since 2018, and using his status as President to justify it.Another charge that has been made against him is that the number of his public appearances dipped significantly after his first year, 2012. This has been a claim of Casey’s in particular.Higgins told O’Rourke that Casey had been running a “black advertisement” against him on that score. He said that after 2012 that he did not put “every single thing” in his diary.The only reliable indicator available to the public is what is on the President’s website. And the evidence clearly suggests a dramatic fall-off in engagements.According to the President’s website, there were 551 public engagements in 2012. That number fell by 30 per cent in 2013 to 394. It fell again to 322 in 2014.It decreased to 115 in 2015, before rising to 254 in 2016, and falling to 222 in 2017.Even if he did not put every single event in, it’s clear that the volume of public engagements dipped, especially in the middle years. The number for 2015 (115) is shockingly low but a source in the Áras suggested that the website was changed and failed to capture all public events. (But that is not really good enough, as this is how the public finds out what the President does.)The other odd feature is that the number of public engagements suddenly rose again this year. And 2018 just happens to be an election year. Until the end of September, there were 227 events, compared to only 142 for the same nine months last year. August and September this year were particularly busy. The website records 38 public events compared to 29 last year, 26 in 2016. There were 29 events in August, compared to six last year and eight in 2016.Perhaps this is just how the events fell. But like everything else in this non-election, it has all played handily into Higgins’ hands.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar brexit is the political equivalent to climate change","story":"  October 18, 2018Varadkar explains \u0026ldquohow far we have come in 30 years, from violence to peace.

Photograph: Emmanuel DunandAFPGetty ImagesTheresa May returned to London on Friday after three days in Brussels that brought her no closer to a Brexit deal and left many of her own MPs at Westminster unhappier than ever. There was some comfort for the prime minister from her fellow EU leaders, who didn’t rule out convening a special summit next month if negotiations make sudden progress. The leaders also decided not to hold a special no-deal summit and to avoid big public announcements about their own preparations for a no-deal Brexit, which could be viewed as provocative or threatening in London.Downing Street seized on Angela Merkel’s reported comments at a dinner of the 27 remaining member states on Wednesday evening when she suggested that the EU and Ireland should show more flexibility over the backstop. Was this the long-awaited intervention by the EU’s “grown-ups” to instruct Michel Barnier to make more concessions over the backstop?\u0026nbspNot if you listen to Emmanuel Macron, who said it was up to Britain to propose a solution for the backstop.“The EU has already demonstrated our flexibility, but there are limits. We cannot jeopardise the single market, the four fundamental liberties, or Ireland. It is no longer a technical issue but one of the political capacity of the UK to find a solution,” he said.The EU leaders not only left Barnier’s mandate unchanged but praised his handling of the negotiations, proposing no change of direction. May’s fellow leaders are conscious of her limited room for manoeuvre at Westminster and they believe that no other potential prime minister would have a better chance of concluding a deal on Brexit.Some senior EU figures are convinced, however, that there is no Brexit deal that will be able to command a majority in the House of Commons, leaving a no-deal Brexit as the most likely outcome.The proposal to extend the transition period by up to a year has angered Conservatives of all stripes and renewed speculation about May’s leadership. Her next big test comes with the budget later this month and with Brexit still unresolved, she can probably rely on the support of the DUP to get it through the Commons.In the meantime, there is little expectation of progress in the negotiations, making mid-December the earliest likely moment to conclude a Brexit deal. After, the prime minister will face the formidable challenge of constructing a parliamentary majority behind whatever she agrees with the EU.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

mps vote change countrys name easing tension greece","story":"Voters backed plans to change Macedonia\u0026#39s name to North Macedonia in a referendum marked by low turnoutMacedonia\u0027s parliament on Friday voted to start the process of renaming the country North Macedonia, a major step towards ending a decades-long stalemate with Greece and opening a door to Nato and the EU.The razor-thin majority was reached after a tense week of debate and back-room negotiations in Skopje, where it was unclear until the last moment whether the government could secure votes from two-thirds of parliament.Amendments will now be drafted to incorporate the new name into the constitution, after which another parliamentary vote will be required to enshrine the changes.I can confirm that with 80 \u0027yes\u0027 votes the parliament adopted the proposal by the government to start the procedure to change the constitution, said Talat Xhaferi, speaker of the 120-member assembly.Although more legislative hurdles await, it is a crucial victory for Zoran Zaev, the prime minister, who had to win over several MPs from the right-wing VMRO-DPMNE party that has been staunchly against the deal.Under the accord, which Mr Zaev struck with his Greek counterpart in June, the Balkan state would rename itself North Macedonia in exchange for Athens\u0027 promise to stop blocking its entry into Nato  and the EU.Opposition members of parliament stand to boycott the vote as Macedonia\u0026#39s MPs vote to start changing constitutional amendmentsGreece has stood in Macedonia\u0027s way for 27 years in protest at the country\u0027s name, which it argues is an encroachment on its own province called Macedonia.Macedonian critics of the deal have slammed it as an embarrassing concession to Athens.But enough VMRO-DPMNE MPs were eventually persuaded to break ranks with the party leadership.I want to say thank you to every MP and especially to the MPs from VMRO-DPMNE who put the state\u0027s interests above party and personal interests, despite the unnecessary pressure over them, Mr Zaev said after the vote, adding that he would guarantee their safety.Among the \u0027yes\u0027 voters were three VMRO-DPMNE politicians who were granted bail from house arrest this week.They are facing trial for their alleged involvement in a bloody mob attack on parliament on April 27, 2017, when nationalist supporters of VMRO-DPMNE stormed the assembly and injured scores, including Mr Zaev.The prime minister refused to say Friday whether there had been any negotiation for their eventual amnesty.Top 5 | Facts about the Republic of MacedoniaI personally forgive everyone, he told reporters, reiterating a call her made earlier in the week for reconciliation over the incident.He also denied an accusation from VMRO-DPMNE that his government had offered bribes for votes.In recent weeks US and EU officials have voiced strong support for the name-change deal, pitching it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Macedonia to cement an alliance with the West.A great day for #democracy in #Skopje! EU enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn tweeted after the vote.I expect that the free choice of all MPs is fully respected, especially of those who crossed the aisle tonight, he added.Comment: The Brexit headbangers understand the EU far better than Theresa MayComment: The Left remain trapped in the strange bubble of identity politicsComment: Nursery rhymes rewritten for Keira Knightley... and other PC parentsComment: Theresa May must change her Brexit strategy now, or risk her own Black WednesdayRoyal tour: Duke and Duchess of Sussex unveil Sydney\u0026#39s Anzac memorialSaudi Arabaia admits Jamal Khashoggi was killed in fight at consulateBritish-built spacecraft blasts off on mission to MercurySaudi crown prince loses key aides over Khashoggi death but is on way to defusing diplomatic crisisMigrant caravan charges the Mexican borderMurder charges over death of Battersea man who complained about drug dealers on his estatePlastic becoming too expensive to recycle, councils say, as giant waste mountain is discovered\u0026#39Evidence points to crown prince\u0026#39 in Khashoggi affair, says former MI6 chiefTrump adviser John Bolton headed to Russia amid reports US is quitting nuclear dealCacti and herbs help Cornish city win Britain in Bloom as heatwave summer hurts rivalsUS charges Russian woman Elena Khusyaynova with interfering in US electionsAssange prepares to sue Ecuador government for \u0026#39violating his freedoms\u0026#39Caravan of migrants push through Guatemala\u0026#39s border to MexicoNational Trust fees could rise if barbed wire is banned, campaigners warnWe need \u0026#39a steady supply\u0026#39 of new homes in our National Parks, says Michael Gove adviserMPs told \u0026#39don\u0026#39t abuse your powers and influence\u0026#39 over others in Parliament\u0026#39s new anti-bullying signs We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/14/16/apple.jpg","title":"apple ipad pro mac event latest update iphone xs new york october","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsJournalists gather for a product launch event at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, on September 12, 2018Click to followThe Independent TechApple will hold its next big event at the end of the month, it has announced.The launch – to be held in New York City on 30 October – is widely expected to see the unveiling of a new iPad\u0026nbspPro and fresh Macs.It comes just a few weeks after Apple launched its new iPhones.

All included an artistic variation on the Apple logo and a strapline reading There\u0027s more in the making, suggesting – along with the venue – that the launch could be focused on creativity.Apple\u0027s event will be held on the same day as rival OnePlus unveils its latest phone, the OnePlus 6T, in the same city and\u0026nbspjust a few hours before. That company – whose handset is often hailed as a challenger to the\u0026nbspiPhone – has spoken about how it is aiming to go mainstream with its latest handset and take on rivals like Apple.It will also bring an end to a busy period of launches, all scheduled before the holiday season, that has also included new Amazon Echos, phones from rivals including Samsung and Huawei, as well as Apple\u0027s own launch of three updated phones and the brand new Apple Watch Series 4.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The audible vehicle alert system (AVAS) was designed to warn visually impaired pedestrians when an electric vehicle is approaching, as the cars are almost silent when operating at lower speeds. Jaguar had originally planned to make the I-Pace sound like a “sci-fi spacecraft”, but in testing the carmaker found that the sound caused pedestrians to look up at the sky, instead of in the direction of the vehicle. Electric vehicles already able to cut greenhouse gas emissions by halfUK needs six-fold increase in electric vehicle charging points by 2020Electric vehicle sales held back by ‘deceptive’ car dealershipsUK provides millions to help build more electric vehicle batteriesThe company then developed a new sound, which is emitted from a speaker located behind the front grille. The alert can be heard in every direction, and cannot be switched off. Jaguar engineers worked for four years to develop the AVAS, and consulted with charity Guide Dogs for the Blind to “ensure real people are at the heart of our product testing”.Iain Suffield, a technical specialist at Jaguar, said: “The absence of traditional engine noise from electric vehicles creates a problem for vulnerable pedestrians, such as the blind or visually impaired. This is especially true at low speeds in town centres and car parks. We developed the audible vehicle alert system for the I-Pace to ensure the safety of all road users.”Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They have a social and financial responsibility to be transparent – that\u0027s why we\u0027re demanding independence and accountability in the company\u0027s boardroom, said New York City Comnptroller\u0026nbspScott Stringer.An independent board chair is essential to moving Facebook forward from this mess, and to reestablish trust with Americans and investors alike.The proposal will be put to a vote at the company\u0027s annual shareholder meeting in May 2019, however it will be largely symbolic due to the control that Mr Zuckerberg has over the company\u0027s board.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s reign at Facebook has previously been compared to a dictatorship because he owns a majority of voting rights to the firm.In an op-ed earlier this year, a member of the California State Teachers\u0027 Retirement System (CalSTRS), which holds shares in Facebook, called for the company to make changes to reflect its size.Facebook has grown at an unbelievable pace. The capital structure has changed and it is time for its governance to catch up, CalSTRS\u0026nbspinvestment officer Aeisha Mastagni wrote in\u0026nbspThe Financial Times.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By 2010, the energy-producing kites were being built with rigid wings that could harness more power from a higher lift.The most recent version of the Makani kite was first flown in test flights in December 2016, performing loop-the-loops in a wide circle in the skies that produced up to 600 kW – enough electricity to power around 300 homes.It is estimated that wind power has the potential to meet the world\u0027s energy need 100-times over,\u0026nbspalthough currently only four\u0026nbspper cent of the world\u0027s electricity is generated from wind.Makani believes that it\u0027s possible to unlock additional wind resources that aren\u0027t accessible or cost effective today, the project\u0027s website states.\u0026nbspOur low mass opens up new possibilities for wind power in deepwater offshore sites. We continue to design, prototype and test energy kites so that more people around the world can have access to clean, affordable wind power.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It also comes in a whole host of looks, with Apple re-introducing brighter colours to its range.Beyond the design, the features of the iPhone Xr are almost the same as its more expensive sibling. It still features the beefed up A12 bionic processor and the improved camera.But it also removes some of the more expensive features, too. The Xr has an LCD screen rather than the richer OLED found on the Xs, and features only one camera on the back instead of two.The Xr starts at $749 in the US, or roughly in the same in pounds and euros. The same carriers that offered deals on the Xs are doing so for the Xr.The handset will actually go on sale – and arrive with people who pre-order it – just a few days before Apple\u0027s next big launch event.

The audible vehicle alert system (AVAS) was designed to warn visually impaired pedestrians when an electric vehicle is approaching, as the cars are almost silent when operating at lower speeds. Jaguar had originally planned to make the I-Pace sound like a “sci-fi spacecraft”, but in testing the carmaker found that the sound caused pedestrians to look up at the sky, instead of in the direction of the vehicle. Electric vehicles already able to cut greenhouse gas emissions by halfUK needs six-fold increase in electric vehicle charging points by 2020Electric vehicle sales held back by ‘deceptive’ car dealershipsUK provides millions to help build more electric vehicle batteriesThe company then developed a new sound, which is emitted from a speaker located behind the front grille. The alert can be heard in every direction, and cannot be switched off. Jaguar engineers worked for four years to develop the AVAS, and consulted with charity Guide Dogs for the Blind to “ensure real people are at the heart of our product testing”.Iain Suffield, a technical specialist at Jaguar, said: “The absence of traditional engine noise from electric vehicles creates a problem for vulnerable pedestrians, such as the blind or visually impaired. This is especially true at low speeds in town centres and car parks. We developed the audible vehicle alert system for the I-Pace to ensure the safety of all road users.”Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If you’re northern, you know it, says\u0026nbspDavid Barnett. If you’re not sure, then you probably\u0026nbsparen’tClick to followThe Independent(Royle) Family values: It does feel that there is a thing we can call northernness, which might comprise warmth, and friendliness, and humour and grit, but which is much more than the sum of those cliched parts, and much harder to properly defineThe north is a mercurial territory, and northernness itself a will-o’-the-wispish thing that’s hard to pin down.We know where the north (of England) ends – that’s Hadrian’s Wall, of course well, give or take. But arguments as to where it begins rage quietly in the background all the time. Anywhere upwards of the Watford Gap, goes the hoary old joke, if you’re from London.Research last year conducted by Liverpool University suggested that the north now begins somewhere in Leicestershire, having moved south slightly from Derbyshire. To a northerner from Lancashire or Yorkshire, both those places seem to be more the Midlands… but aren’t Midlanders really just northerners anyway?The north-south ide in schools is real – and it’s more complex thanWe in the north wear northernness like a badge of pride. In 2005, The Wedding Present released a single called\u0026nbsp“I’m From Further North Than You”. The band is from Leeds, which is squarely in the north. Yet it’s considerably further south than Carlisle, the most northerly city in England.It would take you the best part of three hours to drive from Carlisle to Sheffield. Sheffield is indisputably in the north, yet skirts those Peak District lands, the Nottinghams and Chesterfields which form the gateway to the Midlands.iStock)Last summer, website The Tab drew up a map showing the north-south ide according to the number of shops of baked goods purveyor Greggs in any particular area, and according to this metric, Sheffield was put in the south.Ridiculous, of course, as anyone who watched the opening episode of\u0026nbspDoctor Who earlier this month will know. The new – and first female – Doctor is played by Jodie Whittaker, who hails from Huddersfield. The entire episode was set in Sheffield, and was as northern as you like – too northern, according to some commentators on Twitter. And heaven knows what the large contingent of American Whovians made of such joyous sight gags as a drunk throwing the salad out of his kebab at a menacing alien.If the boundaries are blurred, then northernness as a concept is perhaps even harder to pin down… at least from the outside. If you’re northern, you know it. If you’re not sure, then you probably aren’t.I have lived in the north all my life, first in Lancashire (and the bits re-designated Greater Manchester after local government reform in 1974), and then in Yorkshire. There is a rumour that northerners are warm and friendly, and we are. Or some of us, at least. We’re not exactly all dancing around like Munchkins there is still a fairly large contingent of people who will rip you off or rough you up or be generally as horrid as criminals are in London.But, by and large, the general populace does have what feels like a greater empathy for others than we, as northerners, often see on our sojourns down south. Up here in the north we genuinely smile at strangers on the street often even talk to them. I remember one of my first trips to the capital, to see Wigan play in the Rugby League Challenge Cup final at Wembley. A contingent of Wiganers were standing in Euston station, asking passersby how best to get to Wembley. They were roundly ignored, much to their puzzlement. A little while later I saw a different group handing out song sheets to stony-faced passengers on the Tube, offering to teach them some Wigan chants.We have space to breathe, in the north. The air’s a lot clearer than it used to be, thanks to various environmental acts and, oh, the fact that most of the heavy industry the country used to rely on us for has long since been closed down. We can get a decent-sized place to live. One of a northerner’s favourite TV shows is the famed comedy programme Location, Location, Location, which features Londoners with more money than sense cooing over properties the size of our toilets (which are all indoors these days, by\u0026nbspthe way) and which cost four or five times more than our actual houses.I am being facetious, of course. But it does feel that there is a thing we can call northernness, which might comprise warmth, and friendliness, and humour and grit, but which is much more than the sum of those cliched parts, and much harder to properly define.Oli Bentley is the creative director of a design studio based in Leeds, called Split. He has taken it upon himself to gather, like wool, various notions of northernness from writers and creatives for a project that was initially part of Leeds’ bid to become the European Capital of Culture in 2023.A bid which, of course, was thoroughly torpedoed by Brexit, and the news earlier this year that British cities will not be welcome to apply for the accolade after we leave the EU next year.Undaunted, those driving the Leeds bid decided to build on the legacy of the hard work carried out in the city by holding a year-long celebration of culture in 2023. One of the first projects out of the trap is the book Bentley has curated, called These Northern Types.Bentley is entrenched in the north. He studied design at Cumbria Institute of the Arts, up there in Carlisle, and while studying at Leeds College of Music after that he set up his Split business from his bedsit. So what is northernness?“Northernness is a myth,” asserts Bentley. “As a designer, I spend much of my time working with identities – specifically, visual identities for companies, institutions, iniduals, bands and arts organisations: brands. I think it is this daily involvement with the perceptions of identities that made me fascinated by this multifaceted, community-owned, slippery thing we call ‘northern identity’. That, and the realisation that, as a lifelong proud northerner, I was beginning to feel unsure about what that actually meant.”So Bentley went on a journey to rediscover, or perhaps discover for the first time, what northernness really is, if it actually exists, and he went to writers and artists and musicians for their take on it.That great northern actor\u0026nbspWarren Clarke\u0026nbsponce played the role of a corrupt copper in Red Riding, the TV adaptation of writer David Peace’s The Red Riding Quartet. The books are an astonishing slice of Yorkshire noir, interconnected narratives which weave in and out of the Yorkshire Ripper murders and the subsequent hunt for their perpetrator, Peter Sutcliffe.Clarke played chief superintendent Bill Molloy, a gruff, no-nonsense copper who you wouldn’t exactly say exuded warmth and friendliness, but instead another aspect of northernness: determination, and the recognition that London is a long way away. Presiding over a group of colleagues in a clandestine meeting, Molloy proposes a toast: “To the north, where we do what we want.”Molloy and his compatriots meant it for nefarious purposes, but it’s a mantra that endures for less sinister reasons. Here in the north we can’t rely on anyone else when we do, they rip the rug from under us. We commit with all our hearts and souls and lives to digging coal or tempering steel, and then someone in London closes the pits and the foundries and there’s nothing else for us to do. It is an irony that the north voted, on the whole, for Brexit a lot of European money was pumped, over the years, into communities ravaged by the death of industrialisation. But the majority Leave vote was born from that suspicion of outside forces exerting too much influence on a region that has been bitten and burned many times.The Capital of Culture being torpedoed and rising as a legacy project is an example of that determination, as is Bentley’s curating of the book These Northern Types. It is, as you’d expect from someone who trained in design, an artefact as much as a text it comprises 17 inidually-bound books, collected together, and created by some of the most interesting thinkers in the north today.In his introduction to the book, Bentley writes: “The focus of this project is, at times, less about location, and more about class – an issue that touches nearly every chapter. Or they are about what it is to be ‘other’ to ‘the position of civility... always taken by the seat of power’.“About living in the other half of the country from the centres of power, finance, media, intellectualism and culture – a situation shared not only with communities from Wales to Dorset to Scotland, but with communities all over the globe.”These Northern Types offers a taste of the north that is unparalleled since someone in Wigan decided to put a meat and potato pie between a barm cake. It is beautiful to look at yet uncompromising and direct. In the essay “Does It Still Matter Where We Come From?”, Dr Katy Wright addresses whether there is, in fact, any need to align yourself to northernness or anything else.She writes: “For many – though by no means all – northernness has involved a sense of marginalisation, abandonment and peripherality, which has often been accompanied by experiences of misrecognition, and stereotypes projected from outside. These have involved portraying northerners as, variously, uneducated, opinionated, mean with money, unsophisticated or conservative. Struggling northern towns and cities like Hull, Scunthorpe, Barnsley and Morecambe provide the punchlines to unfunny jokes about ‘crap towns’ and shitholes.”It is, after all, grim up north. At first it was grim because of the industry that roosted here like dark ravens, the sooty chimneys of Dickens’ Coketown (a thinly disguised Preston), the blackened faces of the miners, the clang-and-heat of the Hephaestan steel forges, the hypnotic rattle of the cotton looms. And then it was grim because the industry was torn down. Grim because of the grit and we have grit because of the grimness.Boff Whalley was the guitarist in agit-popsters Chumbawamba now he is a playwright and the founder of the Commoners Choir. His piece is about northern grit, and how the elements haven’t just formed our dramatic landscape, but do the same to us.“So much of northern culture – historical, social and political – has sprung from our weather,” he writes. “The Smiths were The Smiths and not the Beach Boys because they were born into a land of dripping raincoats and stone doorways that you huddle into. Ted Hughes thrived on the bleak grey swirl of Yorkshire uplands. Our favourite fiction, from the Brontes to Alan Sillitoe to Ken Loach, is peppered with the drama of rain. Many of Turner’s paintings are suffused with storms, mists and fogs (he climbed the hill above what’s now my home town at the foot of the Yorkshire Dales to make endless studies for his great painterly skies) English films – from Billy Elliot to The Full Monty – are drenched in the melancholy of rain. And what comes of all this dour, dull weather? Resilience. Resolve. Gritting your teeth. Grit.”Grim… grit… here’s another one for you. Graft. That means hard work. It’s also the name of the typeface Oli Bentley put together for the book and for anyone else who wants to use it. A typeface for the north. Bentley himself questioned the point of the exercise, other than being a nice little artistic project. Then he had another idea: “Let’s use the typeface to work with local community groups across the north. We bring the letters, they bring the words. Then we put these words up in the places they’re from. This led to the idea of printing giant outdoor posters – the sort you can easily and cheaply flypost. To work with local writers to amplify voices – not just listen, but help them be heard.”Because being heard is something the north struggles with. When we complain that we’re being left behind, we get thrown bones such as the Northern Powerhouse project, an admittedly ambitious plan to boost the economy of the north, put into place by the Conservative-Liberal coalition, much lauded and trumpeted, and then quietly… well, if not abandoned, then at least put on the shelf with the other exciting new initiatives that were going to transform the north, until such time as anyone south of wherever the north’s border is these days cares enough to put money into it. And meanwhile transport – one of the major tenets of the Northern Powerhouse – continues to struggle, with train services especially a bone of particular contention. They don’t call Northern Rail “Northern Fail” for nothing these days.Boff Whalley mentioned The Smiths and, indeed, music is part of the fabric of the north. Benjamin Myers is an author who this year won the Walter Scott Prize for his novel The Gallows Pole. It brought him £25,000, but his win was largely ignored by the London-centric publishing press. For the book, Myers writes about music, as well, and in doing so explodes a myth about living in the north that is prevalent. His piece is a paean to watching bands, and then forming one, a familiar rite of passage: “You gig round the north, the four of you, with your bad hair and bumfluff ’taches. You play es and established venues you play political benefits and school halls and nightclubs and student unions.Emmerdale\u0026nbsprolling hills, you know (Getty)“Being in a band forces you to be an adult at 15 as you deal with clueless promoters and jealous death metal bands, American rock stars and patronising regional DJs. You ward off stage-invading Nazi skinheads and cynical producers. You duck flying bottles and you get thrown out of your own shows for being underage.“You come from that part of the north that rarely gets written about – neither the gritty towns and cities of economic decline nor the dales and vales and uplands, but somewhere in between: the lower-middle-class suburbs. Here is a seemingly endless maze of culs-de-sac and alleyways, tarmac and green spaces, where aspiration exists, and creative seeds are sown, yet which broader culture barely seems to acknowledge, as if the north is either terraced houses or Dales farmlands, Corrie or Emmerdale. It’s not that black and white though most live in a grey-area Britain.”Are we seeing the resurgence of Nazism? This graphic novel thinks soSpoiler alert: Have fractured viewing habits ruined the suspense?Dacre Stoker on resurrecting his great-grand-uncle’s vampireThrough the works in These Northern Types, only a fraction of which are referenced here, several things seem to emerge. There is something called northernness, but it’s difficult to pin down. We’re just like everybody else, but completely different. We don’t even know where the north begins, nor can we agree on what it really means to be northern.It’s almost as if the ideas of northernness are laid down by other people, and none of them are what we really feel. But we can’t voice how we truly are inside, because to examine it too closely would make it seem less distinct, less real.The north is a place made up of iniduals, bound by an ethereal quality that is at once a myth and, conversely, as real as grit and graft. Northernness is perhaps something everyone here has, and is, but in subtly and uniquely different ways. The north makes us, and northernness is what we make it. So raise your glasses please, to the north: where we do – and can be – what we want.‘These Northern Types’ is out now, priced £32, from splitNorth of EnglandCapital of CultureShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Normally these kinds of structures are known at lower redshifts, which means when the Universe has had much more time to evolve and construct such huge things. It was a surprise to see something this evolved when the Universe was relatively young!The structure, which is known by scientists as Hyperion, was spotted by a team of scientists who used the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope to peer into the early universe and look for galaxies forming. It was then they spotted Hyperion, a colossal mass that is more than a million billion times that of the Sun.Vast cosmic explosions could be flinging gold across the universeIt is not only huge but very complex. Hyperion is made up of at least seven high-density regions, which are strung together by threads of galaxies. That structure is different to the kind of superclusters we usually see closer to us, even though the size is similar.Superclusters closer to Earth tend to a much more concentrated distribution of mass with clear structural features, explains Brian Lemaux, an astronomer from University of California, Davis and LAM, and a member of the team behind this result. But in Hyperion, the mass is distributed much more uniformly in a series of connected blobs, populated by loose associations of galaxies.The difference is probably a consequence of the fact that the closer by superclusters have had billions of years of being pushed into denser regions by galaxies. Hyperion, which is much younger, has been subject to that process much less.Eventually, Hyperion will probably evolve into something similar to those structures: the kind that make up the Sloan Great Wall, or the Virgo Supercluster in which our own galaxy sits. Understanding how that process happens could allow us to peer into the past of our own galaxy and understand how it might have formed.Understanding Hyperion and how it compares to similar recent structures can give insights into how the Universe developed in the past and will evolve into the future, and allows us the opportunity to challenge some models of supercluster formation, said\u0026nbspCucciati. Unearthing this cosmic titan helps uncover the history of these large-scale structures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It might, for instance, contain water ice, hidden in shadows on its otherwise blazing hot surface, scientists speculate – a discovery that could help shed light on the possibility of alien life in our own solar system.It will also look to explain why the planet has such as huge iron core at its centre, and unlock the history of the vast\u0026nbspvolcanic vents that shook its surface for billions of years.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Smaller craft have previously employed ion thrusters to reach asteroids and the moon.The ion drive will be used not to accelerate the spacecraft but to act as a brake as it falls into the grip of the sun\u0027s powerful gravity.A complex series of fly-bys past the Earth, Venus and Mercury will further reduce its velocity.Even so, BepiColumbo will reach a top speed of 60 kilometres (37 miles) per second.The European Space Agency\u0027s Mercury Planet Orbiter (MPO), which will survey the planet\u0027s surface and probe its chemistry, was built by satellite company Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage.Airbus also constructed the power unit carrying the orbiters, the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM), in the UK. The ion thrusters were supplied by British defence technology company QinetiQ.One of the European orbiter\u0027s 11 instruments, the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (Mixs) was designed and built at the University of Leicester.The Japanese space agency Jaxa\u0027s Mercury Magnetosphere Orbiter (MMO) will study the planet\u0027s internal structure and enveloping magnetic field.A major challenge for mission planners was ensuring the spacecraft could withstand searing temperatures of more than 350C so close to the sun.Protective measures include a heat shield, novel ceramic and titanium insulation, ammonia-filled heat pipes, and in the case of the Japanese orbiter, spinning.Dr Graham Turnock, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said: UK scientists, engineers and technicians have played a vital role in developing BepiColombo and the incredibly sophisticated set of scientific instruments on board.The international collaboration involved in this mission shows how our leading role in the European Space Agency is ensuring the UK thrives in the new space age, bringing real benefits to UK companies and scientists.Only two spacecraft have previously visited Mercury. Nasa\u0027s Mariner 10 flew past the planet three times in 1974-75 and the American space agency\u0027s Messenger probe orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015, taking photos of the surface.Dr Jerry Bolter, project manager at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, said: The scientists describe Messenger as the hors d\u0027oeuvre and Bepi asThe spacecraft was named after the late Guiseppe Bepi Colombo, an Italian scientist and engineer who played a leading role in the 1974 Mariner 10 mission to Mercury.Paolo Ferri, head of missions at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, said: Mercury is a planet of extremes, and getting there requires some equally extreme techniques, navigation solutions and operations expertise.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The only people who know who is paying for these adverts is Facebook.“While debate on one of the central issues facing our country is part of a thriving democracy, there is an important question of where campaigning stops and political advertising starts. Facebook has recently announced a set of changes to increase transparency around political advertising on its platform.He added: “This example offers Facebook an opportunity to show it is committed to making that change happen - if you are targeted with a message or asked to do lobby your MP, you should know exactly who is behind the organisation asking you to do it.”Many of the Facebook adverts lead users to send a template email to their MP that calls on them to “respect the referendum result and bin the Chequers deal before it’s too late”.The email claims the plan “would result in us having no real control over our borders, unable to make our own trade arrangements and still subject to European laws”.Among the 700 pages on the Mainstream Network website are those specifically targeted at voters in a range of key constituencies, containing tailored local messaging.Evidence submitted to the committee suggested the site was “a potentially highly sophisticated pro-Brexit campaign” backed by “a substantial amount of money”.89up suggested the website was likely in breach of laws on non-party political campaigning.Labour MP and DCMS committee member Jo Stevens, who backs the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign, said: “Facebook can now add facilitating alleged breaches of the new data protection rules to its long list of corporate scandals.“Getting Facebook to come clean about their role in influencing elections and referendums has been like trying to get blood out of a stone. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to take responsibility and come to Parliament to answer our questions.”Facebook pages for Women\u0027s March are elaborate scam to sell t-shirtsFacebook builds \u0027war room\u0027 to try and stop election interferencFacebook cracks down on \u0027dark ads\u0027 to prevent political propagandaFacebook says 30 million user accounts were stolen in huge hackThe new questions over advertising on Facebook come after the tech giant was accused of fraud by a group of advertisers in the US, who claimed it had intentionally inflated viewing figures for adverts.

It was a joint enterprise between forceful campaigning and the internal rot inherent in the arguments for Leave.The seeds of the fightback were laid as early as August 2016, when the Open Britain campaign group was set up pledging to highlight the problems with Brexit, work out why the Leave campaign had won such support and shape the critical parliamentary debate to come.MPs who have publicly backed a second referendum on EU membershipIt determinedly chipped away at the dogma underpinning Brexit, but it was not until Open Britain teamed up with a string of other groups to launch the People’s Vote campaign in April this year, that it became clear there was now a formidable campaign network mobilising.That was then turbocharged\u0026nbspin July when\u0026nbspThe Independent launched its Final Say campaign, with hundreds of thousands flocking to its petition in days, proving that those wanting a rethink on Brexit had not only found a voice, but were prepared to stand up for the cause en masse – something any elected politician ignores at their peril.Since then unions, celebrities and political figures have increasingly come out in support of a new referendum. The number of MPs publicly backing the idea\u0026nbspexceeds 100, with others doing so privately and even more conceding it may be inevitable regardless of their own personal support.Labour as a party has been pushed to build the possibility of a new referendum into its overall policy plan, meaning the prospect of it now happening is impossible to ignore.Meanwhile, the weaknesses of those pushing Brexit forward have been continually exposed, sometime brutally\u0026nbspfirst by a general election, then by negotiations in Brussels and unceasingly by ision at almost every level of the Conservative Party.The prime minister may yet win a deal in Brussels, but she then faces the prospect of it falling to shreds as she drags it across the splintered backbenches in a bid to gain distant-looking parliamentary approval.It is not often that an MP comes out and calls his own party a “shit show”, but the contortions of Ms May’s Brexit policy led an angry Johnny Mercer to do just that this week.On Saturday thousands of people will also make their anger public as they take to the streets of London to demand another referendum,\u0026nbspsomething they believe to be a rare sensible option in the nonsensical era of Brexit politics.If it comes to pass, they will be able to say they were there on the day that secured Britain its Final Say.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It would also make David Friedman, the US ambassador to\u0026nbspIsrael, who is hated by Palestinians over his support for Israeli\u0026nbspsettlements in the West Bank, the main interlocutor with the Palestinian leadership.Israel’s plan to demolish West Bank village ‘could be war crime’It follows a series of decisions by President Donald Trump that the Palestinians say proves the Americans have sided with Israel and are no longer objective mediators.Mr Pompeo defended the change, saying that it would be more “efficient”.“This decision is driven by our global efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. It does not signal a change of US policy,” he said.He added the United States “continues to take no position” on how any peace deal between the Israelis\u0026nbspand Palestinians would take shape.This decision has nothing to do with peace. It complicates peace and makes it impossible\u0026nbspIn Israel, the move was celebrated.Michael Oren, deputy minister for diplomacy and a former Israeli ambassador to the US, said it was “great day for Israel, Jerusalem and the US”.“Closing the US consulate in Jerusalem and transferring its responsibilities to the embassy ends the last vestige of American support for the city’s ision.

He is practically saying Jerusalem is for Israel. This decision has nothing to do with peace. It complicates peace and makes it impossible,” he said.\u0026nbspMr Trump faced international backlash for a December decision to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognising it as Israel’s capital.Created with Sketch.Protests erupt after Trump recognises Jerusalem as Israel\u0027s capital Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Supporters of Difa-e-Pakistan Council a coalition of right wing Islamic parties, burn an effigy of US President Donald Trump, during a protest in Quetta, PakistanIsraeli police scuffle with a Palestinian protester outside Damascus Gate in Jerusalem\u0027s Old CityPalestinian protesters burn pictures of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu following Trump\u0027s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, in Gaza CityIsraeli forces disperse Palestinian protesters outside Damascus Gate in Jerusalem\u0027s Old City on 7 December 2017Supporters of the Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC), an Islamic organization, chant slogans as they burn Israeli and US flags during a protest against Donald Trump in PeshawarPalestinians paint an \u0027X\u0027 over the face of a picture of US president Donald J.

You have never panicked in the past.\u0026ldquoThis is, of course, a difficult process. But, inevitably the negotiations are going to be hard-fought.\u0026ldquoThey always and they probably should, from a negotiating technique come down to the wire.\u0026ldquoBut, my guess is Theresa May and her team and the European Commission, the European Union realise they both have big invested interest in reaching an agreement here.\u0026ldquoIf they do reach an agreement, which I think they will by the way at the last minute, then you need to get on with implementing the decision, not postponing it and postponing it.He added: \u0026ldquoPersonally I think you had a referendum, you all voted in the referendum.

You might have done fine remaining in the European Union, I also think you can do fine outside of the European Union.Brexit news: Alexander Downer urged Britain not to panic in Brexit negotiations (Image: )The BBC panel was asked about the Brexit transition period after Mrs May warned the period could be extended following the EU summit this week.The Prime Minister added the transition period would only be extended \u0026ldquofor a matter of months to ensure there was no hard border in Ireland if it proved impossible to implement the future partnership by the end of 2020.The Irish border issue remains a major sticking point in negotiations with Mrs May already categorically rejected the EU\u0026rsquos proposed backstop arrangement, which would effectively place a border down the middle of the Irish Sea.A Brexit summit planned for November was also pushed back by EU leaders until \u0026ldquodecisive progress is made in negotiations.Despite no progress being made at the Brussels summit this week, Mrs May remains optimistic that a deal can still be achieved.Speaking to reporters after the summit, Mrs May said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have had from leaders around the table over the last hours... since I arrived here in Brussels yesterday, is a very real sense that people want that deal to be done.\u0026ldquoAnd I think if you look at some of the comments that have been made, Chancellor Merkel said where there is a will there\u0027s normally a way.\u0026ldquoJean-Claude Juncker said let\u0027s focus on the large areas of agreement and it will be done. So, there is a real sense. So, what we\u0027re doing is working to ensure that we can do this deal within that reasonable timetable.

They got neither.Both couples claimed other commitments but, given that they all took centre stage at Harry and Meghan’s nuptials and the Beckhams also made the cut for William and Kate’s big day, perhaps they felt this wasn’t A-list enough Instead, we had to make do with, among others, models Naomi Campbell, Cara ­Delevingne and Kate Moss, X Factor judges Robbie Williams and Ayda Field, and actresses Demi Moore and Liv Tyler.Some of whom uploaded gushing videos from the event and Instagram photos of their outfits with hashtag plugs for ­ious clothing brands.At a “royal” wedding  The notoriously traditional Queen Mother must be turning in her grave.There will be the modernisers within the palace walls who regard this as “progress” for a monarchy that, as they see it, must appeal to a younger generationit is to survive.But to my mind, it’s the complete opposite.The pomp, ceremony, tradition, duty and, most importantly, ­mystique of the royals is what sustains them.This wedding — between a “Princess” who performs no royal duties and her Jack of tequila trade — has shone a ­spotlight on the blindingly obvious threat that, once the dutul Queen and Prince Philip are no longer with us, the ­“modern” monarchy will continue to make ever decreasing circles until the taxpayer finally decides, “Hang on — they’re just like us” and the game will be up.With this #royalwedding where even the bride’s mother, left, Instagrammed a designer plug “for my amazing dress” that threat has just come one step closer.RITA ORA is promoting her new album Phoenix. “It’s my first global release of an album.I’m really excited to express my music to the world,” she says.But why the seemingly ­regular need to, er, express her breasts at the same time After all, Ed Sheeran has never posed in just his kecks and he’s sold  squillion records.ANGRY passengers on a flight from London Heathrow to Istanbul intervened to stop Home Office officials from deporting Somalian Yaqub Ahmed.“I know he’s scared,” protested one, before leading a chant of: “Take him off the plane, take him off the plane.”Though probably not as scared as the -year-old girl who was gang-raped in London by Ahmed and two of his equally unsavoury friends – the crime for which he was being deported before these witless do-gooders stepped in.Pitully, the officials capitulated and Ahmed is still in this country awaiting our next move.Meanwhile, as some of the passengers virtue-signalled their liberal credentials by posting footage of the showdown, perhaps they could now be identied and charged with obstructing the course of justice Or, at the very least, be asked to welcome the delightful Mr Ahmed into their own homes until such time as his removal can be rearranged Let’s seetheir liberalism extends to putting their own teenage daughters at risk.PIZZAS and pies must shrink to tackle obesity, claim new official guidelines from Public Health England.Sigh.

But the Bible saysI be a fool, I be a fool for Christ,” Chris said.Weve had people healed just in the past few months, even a little baby of about nine months old, who had a fever and couldnt stop vomiting.Ive been healed twice. When I broke my ribs in a car wreck, I remember walking into church in so much pain and I could hardly breathe and somebody put their hands on my ribs and I walked out a dferent person.“When I was on drugs I wasnt even living. All that dope, all that alcohol, all those parties and things that I would go and think ‘boy Im having fun.“It wasnt even until God come into my le that I actually knew what it was like to live.“Out of all the dope Ive ever done I tell people theres no greater feeling than the power of God moving, on you and through you.“When God moves on you to take up those serpents, words can’t describe that feeling. It aint me. Its the power of God.”Services at the House of the Lord Jesus are similar to those practiced by other Pentecostal faiths - except that followers here use snakes, fire and poison in their worship.They are held every Sunday and can last between  minutes to four hours long depending on how many people feel “overcome with the spirit”, want to testy about their experiences or be healed.The snakes are always brought to the service in their wooden boxes but arent always brought out.Chris had explained earlier how he wouldn’t take out the snakes unless he felt the “holy spirit was with him” a sensation he says “is better felt than described”.Throughout it all, the snake never bites anyone around it or attempts to, and almost looks leless, until Chris puts it down on the pulpit and it coils into a ball.During the fascinating spectacle, the frenzied churchgoers clap, dance, scream and shout some even appear to speak in tongues.Afterwards Chris, who suffers from liver problems and is unable to work, is exhausted, sweating and breathless.He tells me afterwards he had to rush to the bathroom to vomit mid-service: “Sometimes the spirit comes on so strong it makes you sick,” he says.Three people come forward to be healed or to ask for prayers for loved ones. The congregations gathers around them and lay their hands on them.“Outside of believing in the five signs of the Gospel I dont think we’re much dferent from any other church.“When God moves in that way we participate in taking up the serpents and whatever  he may ask it to be, fire, poison, pray for the sick, speak in tongues, cast out devils.“We don’t worship the snake, we worship the Lord Jesus Christ, but in the Bible Luke tells us that he gives us power to tread on the scorpions and serpents and nothing shall hurt us by no means.James Bowman, , a mechanic from West Virginia, said he came to the church for the first time two months ago after seeing a video of a service online and believes “finding Jesus” has finally cured him from his lelong alcoholism.“It was the serpents that attracted me here,” he said.“I was a full blown alcoholic but as soon as I saw him lt those snakes that was it for me and I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol since and I don’t plan to. I’ve got my le back.”James now brings his we Crystal, , to the church - along with their three grandchildren, Elaila, , Justin, , and Aubrey, , who sit in the front row mesmerised and unafraid during the snake-handling service.Pastor Chris was just  years old when he saw his dad receive a fatal bite from a rattlesnake as he was preaching.Mack Ray Wolford died a slow and painful death as the snake’s poison coursed round his body stopping his blood from clotting, causing him to haemorrhage to death - taking his last breathe around nine hours later.Almost  years later, Chris watched as his beloved brother Mack “Randy” Wolford die in the same way – bitten by a deadly rattlesnake while he was preaching during an outdoor service.Chris tearfully recalls trying to give his brother - who he described as his “best friend” - CPR and how blood gushed out of his lungs with every compression.“I hated to lose my dad. I loved my dad. And I loved my brother more than anything. He was my pastor, my brother, my best friend. “I mean there wasnt a day that went by that I didnt call him or he didnt call me - we were very, very close. Not a day goes by I don’t think about him but he found something that was worth dying for, something that he loved more than he loved his self. “The day he got bit - and it was the same with my father - when we asked ‘do you want to go to the hospital ’ They could - we dont force nobody not to go. But they chose not to go. They were willing to give their lives for what they believe. “I tell people this,it aint worth dying for, it aint worth having and it aint worth believing in.“With my father and my brother, they kept the faith. They fought a good fight, they kept the faith, they finished the race, the course and theyre at peace or with the Lord now.“And I dont even thinkthey could come back, theyd want to come back. I believe that they’re just happy where they are.“The night he died - my brother - I remember sitting at his feet and I told him, I promised, that wed see each other again, that its not going to be the last time we saw each other and Im going to do my best to keep that promise. So one day we can meet on the other side.”And Chris, who has been bitten several times, the last time just two months ago, says that while he doesn’t want to die from a serpent bite, he would be willing to die for his beliefshe had to.“Its not for us to question why these things happen - it’s to believe,” he said.“I watched my father die that way, I watched my brother die that way and its a hard way to die, but I hopeits ever asked from me from the Lord, Im willing to do it.“I’d rather go that way than with a needle in my arm.” Chris’s we Judy comes in part-way through the service and stands at the back.She also lost a family member - her brother - who got bitten while serpent handling and she is terried of losing her husband the same way.“Of course every Sunday I worry it might be the last time I see him. I worry about him getting bit.“I’d rather he could worship God another way - without drinking that poison or holding those snakes. “But it’s his choice and there ain’t nothing I can do to change that.”Chris keeps around half a dozen fully grown snakes in the basement underneath his church - including venomous timber rattlesnakes and copperhead snakes.He also has around four babies after he was given a pregnant snake. Usually the snakes are caught from the surrounding countryside, and kept with heat lamps in glass cages and fed mice.A picture of Jesus watches over the snake den. Chris rejects any claims he mistreats the snakes - and has past inspections from local authorities.“We take good care of these snakes. Some of them I reared since they were babies.“If any of them refuse to eat we put them back out in the wild - some of them just won’t eat in captivity and we don’t want them to die so we turn them back out.”Bizarrely Chris seems terried of the snakes when he uses his snake hook to display them for the camera.The jittery snakes rattle and hiss at every opportunity - the very opposite of how the rattlesnake in the service limply allowed itself to be swing around. “You can see how scared I am of them when God is not with me,” he says.“But when the Spirit is with you all fear just goes.“Anything is possible with the Lord.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was those paid-for photos that led to him having “health problems” and failing to walk his daughter down the aisle.After appearing on every TV and radio outlet that would pay for her bile-fuelled rants, Samantha recently tried to gain entrance to Buckingham Palace to meet Meghan.She was, quite rightly, told by grim-faced security staff to bog off.None of Samantha’s vitriol has stuck and most of the world has fallen almost as head-over-heels in love with Meghan as her besotted husband — especially since the news broke that they are expecting.Given that no one is interested in Samantha’s hysterical attacks on her sister, she wants to bury the hatchet.She has apologised for any past tensions and exclaimed that she’s jumping with joy at the baby news.It’s too little too late, and I’m sure Meghan would agree.Samantha has crossed the line too many times to be forgiven now.If she had shown any loyalty she might have been invited to the ­wedding and welcomed into the royal fold. But instead of acting as a peace-maker, Samantha stirred bad feeling between Meghan and her estranged father.A loving sister would have tried to build bridges, unite family ­factions and show solidarity with Meghan.I’m sure the new Duchess of Sussex would have ­welcomed having family members around her as she adjusted to le in the royal goldfish bowl.In the end, Meghan had only ONE close relative at her wedding, her mum Doria.Along with the absence of the late Princess Diana, it was the day’s only sad note.Samantha could have had a starring role as a loyal sister helping Meghan adjust from successful actress to worldwide megastar.The media would have fallen over themselves to talk to her for insights into her famous sister, but not any more. We are all very tired of Samantha’s negativity and venom.No one has any time for her any more, and for such an attention-seeker that has got to hurt.If she had been kind to Meghan, Samantha would still be relevant. TV stations, magazines and newspapers would be asking her about the mum-to-be and she would be at the heart of all the pregnancy coverage.Instead of being a loyal, loving and supportive source of information about Meghan, Samantha is now ­dismissed as jealous, irrelevant and malicious. No one cares about her opinion any more.Meanwhile, Meghan has won over Australia with a charm offensive that shows no sign of flagging. She and Harry are a true partnership.Unlike the tension between his parents Princess Diana and Prince Charles, Harry is genuinely delighted to see the enthusiasm and love for his we during this tour.Charles would famously get the hump because everyone wanted to meet Diana on royal walkabouts.In contrast, Harry and Meghan are relaxed, spontaneous and genuinely adore each other. It has been good to see them having fun and giving hugs and smiles to the crowds.While Meghan grows in confidence and the public’s affection, Samantha is now an irrelevance.It’s her own fault and she has to live with it. She will always have her nose pressed against the window pane of whatever palace her little sister is in at the time.Still, Sam, there’s always panto, eh ONE of the great joys of my le was watching Disney movies with my daughter when she was growing up.We watched my childhood favourites Dumbo, Bambi and Snow White, then I sat through Beauty And The Beast and The Little Mermaid about two thousand and ten times.So I was bemused to hear that Keira Knightley has banned her three-year-old daughter from ­watching some Disney movies such as Cinderella because the characters are “rescued” by men.This is rather joyless.Cinders might have been wooed by a man dumb enough not to recognise the love of his le until her foot fitted inside a glass slipper, but Belle from Beauty And The Beast is a book-loving, independent girl who tells the handsome but horrible Gaston to sling his hook and falls for the Beast because of the man he is inside. Pocahontas, Tiana, Merida, Rapunzel and especially Mulan are all kick-ass, feisty females.Disney remade Cinderella in  and she was a very dferent character.Keira doesn’t have to let her daughter watch Cinderella when there are so many alternatives available, but she also doesn’t need to be so blinking sanctimonious about it.So Joanna in The Cry is actually in court accused of murdering her sleazebag of a husband after they faked the kidnapping of their dead baby.It’s the last episode tomorrow, when we will find out what the heck has been going on.ButJoanna, played by Jenna Coleman, left, really did kill husband Alistair, I reckon it’s justiable homicide.The ghastly toad sat with his eyemask on and earplugs in, leaving her to deal with a screeching baby all through that epic flight to Australia.Surely on those grounds alone no court would convict her.I ADORED Freddie Mercury and would have gladly given a year of my le to be a fly on the wall at one of his notoriously extravagant and outrageous parties.He was a complete one-off, so I was always rather sceptical and a bit concerned about any film that would try to depict his extraordinary le and capture his sheer showmanship.Thankfully, the makers of new film Bohemian Rhapsody found the ridiculously talented American actor Rami Malek.He doesn’t so much play the part of Freddie but rather inhabits his body and brings him back to le.It’s an Oscar-worthy performance that is both funny and deeply moving and Rami is backed up by the perfectly cast three other members of Queen.Gwilym Lee as Brian May is so uncannily like the ace guitarist that his we Anita Dobson thought she had actually gone back in time, as he’s the spitting image of Brian when the two of them met.The Live Aid sequence, recreating the moment when Freddie and the band blew everyone away with their barnstorming performance, gave me goosebumps.I blubbed a lot during this movie, as well as laughing out loud.It also had me rushing to download all the original Queen albums and rediscovering tracks like Keep Yourself Alive and Doing All Right, as well as the classics such as Killer Queen and We Are The Champions.It’s a cracking film and a love letter to one of the greatest entertainers and most charismatic rock stars of all time. WELL, what a shock and surprise that Girls Aloud’s Nadine Coyle and Cheryl were never best pals. . . said no one ever.It was clear that these two, below in , never really hit it off right from the start when the girls won TV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in  against boyband One True Voice.Back then Nadine was very much the star and lead vocalist, which led to tensions in the group.The girls split into two factions – Nadine and Sarah Harding on one side and Cheryl, Nicola Roberts and ­Kimberley Walsh on the other.Tellingly, Nadine said the girls have never had a big fall-out because they were never really friends in the first place.This is what tends to happen when boy and girl bands are thrown together in a reality show and don’t have a shared history. Cracks appear and there are resentments over who is ­perceived as being ­centre stage.A notable exception are the hugely ­likeable Little Mix, who put all their energies into their music and also to ensuring they give out positive messages about self-esteem and body confidence to their legions of fans.These girls have become genuinely good friends who have each other’s backs and who know that they are stronger together than they would bethey had to stand alone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In other words, will it give the UK a genuine opportunity to leave.Just putting the word temporary in front of the phrase ­”customs union” — a solution favoured by some at the heart of Government — won’t be enough for these Secretaries of State.One tells me that it has “got to be legally binding and enforceable. Something that is vague and not enforceable won’t get through Parliament”. All of this makes the newest face at the Cabinet table, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, absolutely crucial.Cox is a Brexiteer and one of the finest dozen legal brains in the country. Ministers will defer to him on whether this escape clause is worth the paper it’s written on.As one of those helping to ­coordinate the Brexiteers in government tells me, Cox values his reputation too much to try to spin ministers a line. They are confident he will give them an honest assessment of the escape clause’s worth.“Anything will have to go through the AG,” I’m told by one Government source.Cox’s influence will run throughout this process. I understand that the bulk of the Pizza Club of Cabinet ministers who met on Monday night have agreed not to back the final Brexit deal until they have seen the legal advice.I am told that Michael Gove made clear at Cabinet this week that he couldn’t back any Northern Irish backstop until he had been shown “clear, ­written legal advice” on it.This insistence on seeing the legal advice is meant to prevent a repeat of what happened last December when No gave Brexiteer Cabinet ­ministers assurances about what the backstop meant which were not borne out by events.So, the question becomes: Will the EU be prepared to engage with the UK or will Michel Barnier simply say “non, non” Well, there is a cautious ­optimism in No that the political will to do a deal is beginning to be there on the European side. There is a realisation thatthe EU rejects everything May proposes, there will be no agreement reached — and that will mean a hard border in Ireland, which is what everyone is trying to avoid.Interestingly, there is also a sense thatagreement can be reached on the backstop, then the deal has a better chance of passing through Parliament thanOne of those who has read the draft political declaration tells me that the UK EU future relationship is more to the taste of Tory Brexiteers than expected.May must find a way to get the EU to accept an escape clause, for without that she’ll lose more Cabinet Ministers and her position will be even more vulnerable.GAVIN BARWELL, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, had the Government’s junior ministers in on Tuesday. He wanted to talk them through Theresa May’s domestic agenda as outlined in her conference speech.He wanted to emphasise that the Government would prioritise its domestic agenda as soon as the meaningful vote on Brexit was through the Commons.Barwell’s comments fit with an expectation in Cabinet that Mrs May will attempt to relaunch her premiership with a domestic focus as soon as the Commons has voted on her Brexit deal.The aim is to create a rationale for keeping May on as Prime Minister after Brexit day. Influential Cabinet ministers are also expecting Mrs May to reshuffle her Cabinet at that point.The thinking is that a freshened-up Cabinet would give the Government a new, post-Brexit feel without a need to replace the Prime Minister. But the chances of Mrs May staying on long after Brexit day in March  have lowered signicantly in the past few days.Before this week, some Tory MPs argued that Mrs May should stay until the Brexit transition was done in December . They said this would mean that a new leader would be able to come in as a fresh face after Brexit and in time for the next General Election.However, the news that the transition could be extended cuts against that argument, as the transition could take you to months away from the next election.Privately, Tories from the Cabinet down acknowledge thatthe transition can be extended, then the case for keeping Mrs May until the end of it is weaker.Rather, it would be better to get a new leader soon after March  to give them a chance to make an impact on both Brexit and domestic policy before the  General Election.THE European Union likes to say that an Irish backstop is needed to protect the Good Friday agreement.But what that ignores is that by changing the nature of Northern Ireland’s relationship with the rest of the UK without consent, the backstop risks being in breach of that agreement.THERESA MAY’S declaration in her party conference speech that austerity is over has raised expectations of big pay rises across the public sector.At Cabinet this week, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, was keen to hose down this idea. She emphasised that public sector pay deals should be based on retention – eg. how many staff were leaving because the pay isn’t good enough, geographic factors and helping the lowest paid most.I’m told that Mrs Truss told the Cabinet that: “Some pay review bodies have ignored affordability requirements.”I understand Mrs May agreed the Government should get away from the idea of a single figure for public sector pay. Meanwhile, preparations for the Budget continue.This is meant to be a small Budget yet one ­Government source warns it is going to be “bloody contentious”.  Why  Because it will set the baseline for departmental spending ahead of next year’s spending review.THE biggest risk of a leadership challenge to Theresa May comes from cock-up, not conspiracy.The danger for her is not that Brexit ultras organise  letters and send them in simultaneously, forcing a confidence vote in her, but that enough despairing ToryMPs send in their letters and the party stumbles into a vote on Mrs May’s future. One of those involved in discussions about whether to try to remove Mrs May tells me the Brexit ultras “are not as organised as you might think”.If there was a confidence vote, Mrs May would probably survive it. But after this week, it would be closer than it would have been before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The defiant Islamic State supporter was released from Category A HMP Belmarsh in the morning after serving half of his five-and-a-half year sentence. Choudary was flanked by four security guards as he appeared outside his North London digs for just one minute. However, the -year-old may be free but it is a freedom defined by some of the strictest control orders the UK has ever issued on a terror suspect.  If he breaks just one condition of his release licence, he will be back behind bars and made to complete his term. Papers seen by the Mirror show just how tight a line he will have to walk... SURVEILLANCE Wearing a special tag, which he cannot remove, he will monitored remotely  hours a day and put under surveillance by MI. It is likely Counter Terror officers will visit him to let him know they are watching. A source said: “The restrictions may be more prohibitive in some ways than when he was in prison because he will not have his freedom. “These are some of the most oppressive control orders to be placed on an offender and he will certainly know he is being monitored very carefully.” ACCOMMODATION For the first six months, he will have to live in a hostel at a secret address in London. It is likely CCTV will have been placed inside the site, both covertly and overtly so Choudary will know he is being watched always. He must only sleep in his one-room home, which he must be in between pm and am, and pm and pm. He is likely to be moved every few weeks because of the threat from right-wing extremist groups.  MONEY His bank account will effectively be frozen, unless he needs to access cash for very specic and pre-authorised reasons – and the bureaucracy for this will be restrictive. COMMUNICATIONS He will only be allowed one mobile, which the SIM card and identity number of must have been handed to his supervising officer. But it will not be a smart phone as web access is strictly controlled. The phone – likely to be bugged – can be taken from him at moment’s notice and checked by a technician. He is banned from owning a computer unless it is approved by his supervising officer and not allowed messaging service or e-mail access. WORSHIP When he prays, it will be at a specic mosque that has already been approved. But even there he is banned from associating with, contacting or chatting to anyone who has been charged or convicted under Terrorism acts. He is also banned from talking to children in case he tried to push extremist ideology on them. And he cannot have contact with any friends he may have made in jail or any convicted al-Mahajiroun pals.  TRAVEL He will be banned from international travel and may even be refused permission to leave London. Sharing a hostel with  other people Radicaliser Choudary, jailed in  for promoting IS and pledging allegiance to the terror group, is sharing the hostel with around  other people. Some now reportedly want to move. Choudary later walked out of the hostel, at pm, and was whisked away in a waiting Vauxhall Zafira. He sat in the back with a woman wearing a burka. A pal in the front seat hid his face with his coat as the car drove away.  Security and intelligence expert Professor Anthony Glees, from Buckingham University, said Choudary’s followers will see his release as a victory. Prof Glees said: “His sentence was considered by many to be light. While he may not literally have blood on his hands, in the sense that he encouraged others to go and fight for Islamic State, in a very real moral sense his hands are drenched in the blood of IS’s victims. “I agree with prison minister Rory Stewart that Choudary remains ‘a dangerous and pernicious man’. “Can we have confidence that the police and MI will stop him contacting future recruits  He will be seen even more now as an iconic figure, someone who has taken on the British state and come out the other side. “He swore allegiance to IS and in my view he threw away his British citizenship when did. He supportsand should go there now. He is a highly dangerous inidual and we should pray that he leaves these shores.” Locals said they did not want Choudary living near them. Rikki Jean said: “He’s the last thing we need. What’s the point in arresting dangerous people like himhe’s going to be out and in our community in two years ” "},{"url":null,"title":"fast food chains including mcdonalds","story":"NewsMcDonalds, Burger King and KFC fast food chains exposed for giving potentially deadly allergy adviceEXCLUSIVE: A Mirror investigation has revealed many staff are disturbingly unaware about allergens in menu itemsShareCommentsByNada Farhoud:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsNatasha Ednan-Laperouse \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFast-food chains are serving food with staff unaware it has allergens that could trigger deadly reactions.

Tracey Britten, , is expecting three girls, including identical twins, and a boy after spending pound, on IVF treatment in Cyprus. And against all odds, Tracey - already a gran of eight - has now reached  weeks in her pregnancy, despite doctors saying there was “no way” she’d reach the milestone. Doctors said the babies could come “anytime now” but have booked her in for a c-section at the start of November.  But she said her birth is so unusual, the babies will have to be split up immediately after birth, with two sent to a dferent hospital. She said it’s because the hospital near her home only has TWO available specialist incubators - and she’ll need four - and they need to keep some open for other arrivals. She’s also revealed how she has been given steroids to boost the growth of the little ones’ lungs, because they will arrive so early. Tracey, of London, who has been ordered to remain on bed rest, said: “I had my scan last week and they have booked me in for a c-section in around two or three weeks time. “The consultant said he doesn’t think I’ll get to that stage, but then they all said I wouldn’t get to  weeks. “I’m on weekly scans now.  “I’m taking each day as it comes. It’s really at the point where every day counts, and the longer they can stay in the better chance they have of being healthy when they are born. “But they have said that the babies won’t all get to stay in the same hospital. “Two will stay where they are born, but two will be taken to another hospital - hopefully quite nearby. “He said it’s because they only have two specialist incubators in my hospital. I said ‘can’t they bring them to me’ and he laughed. “It’s more complicated than that, and he said they only have two, so two of the babies will be split off and taken in a special ambulance with an incubator as soon as they are born. “I’m going to be here, there any everywhere, but of course what will be, will be. “In my last scan last week and all is very well, but the doctor said ‘put your feet up as much as you can’. I’m supposed to be on bed rest. “But the babies are all fine and healthy. I had two steroid injections at  weeks. “That’s because I could go into labour at any time and it gives their lungs a boost. “The doctor said to me that they are all ok, but he said he can’t make any promises when they are born. “But that’s the case for any baby - evenyou are having just one.”  Tracey said she has stuck by her decision to not buy too much baby gear before the babies arrive. But she has ordered four baby seats to take the little ones home from hospital. “They said I would never get to  weeks, and here I am at ,” she said. “It really is a miracle. “So far, so good. I’m trying to just take each day as it comes.” Tracey had three children - now ,  and  - with her first husband, but they split in  and she met now husband in , marrying in . She had preliminary tests done via her GP in the UK and signed up with a private clinic in Cyprus called Kolan British IVF Center, now called Team Miracle.  She started a course of hormone injections at home and flew out in April - telling friends and family she was going on holiday. She controversially had four embryos implanted in one go and against all the odds they all developed into successful pregnancies. The former drug counsellor paid for the treatment using inheritance left to her by her mum Pauline Smith who died in . She said her mother “always wanted twins” in the family, and feels the babies are a gt from her. Tracey said she “doesn’t care” what her critics have to say, and has longed for another child since an abortion she regrets having  years ago. Doctors suggested she reduce the number of babies she is carrying through selective abortion, but after consulting forums, discussing with her family, and even speaking to experts in America, she decided to keep all four. She’s now having scans every week and will be raising the children with husband Stephen.

I was aged , and hours earlier we’d been told my mum, Heulwen, had suffered a brain aneurysm and was only being kept alive by a le support machine. It was the most painful moment of my le. The doctors were trying to be patient and thoughtful, but there was urgency to their request they couldn’t mask. I remember one saying: “We know what a dficult time this is for you. We’re very sorry, but we need to discuss whether you will agree to donating Heulwen’s organs.” I didn’t completely understand, possibly because of my age, but I did know it felt like they were physically ripping my heart out. I lashed out, horried they were even asking us the question so soon, at such a sensitive time but now I know they were just doing their job. Much of the rest of the conversation is a blur, but as a family my grandad Gordon, now , dad Simon, , uncle Hywel, , my sisters Hanna, , Beth, , and I decided that, yes, we should donate.  My  year-old mum was not on the organ donation register, but she’d happened to tell my uncle six months earlier that she would like to be a donorthe time ever came. I’m sure she didn’t think that time would come so very soon. We had to say goodbye then. I gave her a final hug, and remember she was so warm, while at the same time I knew she wasn’t really there anymore. Then we left the hospital and as soon as I got home, I instantly got changed and binned the clothes I’d been wearing for the last  hours. Le slowly limped on but I didn’t think about organ donation again, instead choosing to block out the memory of that terrible day in January . But when the Mirror launched the Change the Law for Le campaign in , calling for everyone in the UK to be a potential organ donor unless they choose to opt out, I began to wonder about the people who might have benefitted from my mum’s donation. Were the operations even successful or was it all a waste of time  Was it just one person  Did they have children  Was it a child who was helped  So I decided to write to the NHS donor family care service.  I wasn’t feeling particularly optimistic that I’d be able to find anything out, yet within three days they sent me letters from  addressed to my dad and to me that I’d never seen before - because at the time I just didn’t want to know. It took me a week to prepare myself to read the letters and then it was on a train to Wales, aptly, because that’s where my mum was from, that I decided to open them. Incredibly the letters told me my mum saved six people’s lives. Thanks to her four other mums and a man in his fties had been given le-saving transplants. Her liver was given to a -year-old mum-of-three and one of her kidneys was given to a -year-old single mum with a young daughter. Before the transplant, this mum had been on dialysis for many years and could now spend more time with her little girl. My mum’s second kidney was donated to a -year-old woman who lives with her son, daughter and own mother. She too was confined to a le on dialysis before the transplant.  A -year-old man was given one of my mum’s lungs, and without it he would have died. Before this, he was living alone and struggling to cope on his own at home. The second lung was given to a -year-old woman, married and with two grown up children. But it was a letter dated two months later that touched me the most. Dated March , , it said: “A few weeks ago a five-year-old boy underwent le saving surgery and was transplanted with one of Heulwen’s heart valves. “This little boy was born with severe heart problems and prior to his operation was very unwell. “We can only imagine the dference this operation will make to this boy’s le and to his family.” I now know a little bit of my mum lives on in those six people, something that will now comfort me forever. The immediate years after her death were the most dficult of my le. But I was carried through by the love and support of my family, especially my dad, my sisters, and and my friends. As we pulled each other through, there were still moments of light and laughter while we adapted to le without mum. One Sunday, two weeks after she died, we were remembering how good mum’s gravy was with the roast while dad tried to replicate her recipe. It ended up looking like hot chocolate, which he then accidentally spilt all over the kitchen. We all laughed and cried at the same time.  We remembered how my mum, an animal lover like me, would allow our pet guinea-pigs to run around our living room driving my dad mad. And my favourite memory of the short time I had with mum was just me and her, watching Corrie together. We got a golden retriever called Bruce, who was extremely disobedient but brought us so much happiness during that dark time, always comforting me when the grief would come. And my dad became both parents to three teenages girls. To my great embarrassment, he found it amusing to ask me very loudly over from the next aisle in the supermarket which tampons he should buy for us. My mum was born in Swansea, was very proud to be Welsh, and later went on to work as a speech therapist in St Albans, Hertfordshire, where I grew up. Her real passion was art and music, something she always tried to pass on to me and my sisters. We miss her everyday but are comforted by her incredible legacy. Changing the law to an opt-out system won’t make a death any less painful and, as I know only too well, families might feel outraged when they are asked to donate in that devastating moment. But this is why it’s so important to talk to your loved ones about organ donation andyou, like me, have decided to join the organ donor register.

Noticing his struggles, manager James came over and opened the lane so that Jay could have a go on the till - leaving his dad warm-hearted. Delighted to see his son so focused and engaged, David has praised the stores staff for their patience and empathy in helping him turn a challenging moment into a wonderful memory. David said: I was trying to get him out from behind the till, but Jay decided he wanted to work at Tesco that day.  I was having real dficulty but amazingly the manager, James, came over and opened the till for him.

We call him the ultimate icebreaker because he will talk to anyone, so the staff know him quite well - but we had never met James before.

Jason Edmunds was driving from an address in Battersea, south-west London, to Slough, Berkshire, along a regular route of his, when Mrs Landi was struck and went under his tipper truck, Westminster Magistrates Court was told. He had been turning left, did not signal and hit Mrs Landi who was on a cycle highway and wearing a hi-vis jacket, on September , last year, prosecutor Sophie Akister said.  She told the court: Had the defendant indicated, it is the Crowns case that Mrs Landi would have seen or heard his indication to turn left. She said Mrs Landi, who was believed to have been  weeks pregnant, would not have been aware that the tipper was intending to turn left. She added: The Crowns view is that when the vehicle turned left it collided with her. Ms Akister said Mrs Landi could be spotted on CCTV approaching on the near side and was visible for  seconds before impact. Ms Akister said: The near side mirror was adjusted in such a way that it did not encompass the entire width of the cycle lane. Had it been, Mrs Landi would have been visible for three seconds.  A pretty shaken Edmunds, who is of previous good character, stopped after being waved by passers-by who saw the incident. Schoolchildren were also watching what was happening, the court was told. Emergency services attended and three off-duty doctors tried to help Mrs Landi. Ms Akister told the court one witness said: In my opinion it appeared to be a sudden left turn. I was in shock. The truck went over her body. Ms Akister told the court a passer-by said the contact did not seem particularly hard or the truck was travelling at a particular speed. Edmunds, , of Basildon, Essex, was conditionally bailed to appear for sentencing at Southwark Crown Court on a date yet to be set.

The event, testing drivers’ navigation skills, is the first medal opportunity at the Games pitting competitors from  nations against each other. Teams comprising of a driver and navigator completed challenges in a Jaguar I-PACE - the brand’s first all-electric car was making its Australian debut. The challenges included driving through a water slalom obstacle, a precision driving test and a ‘smart cone’ course.  Great Britain’s Mark “Dot” Perkins, , and Daniel Bingley, , made good progress in the heats this morning and are hopeful of progressing to the final. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will present the winner’s medals ahead of tonight’s Invictus Games opening ceremony. Team captain Mark is vying for medals in road cycling, indoor rowing.  He was seriously injured in Kenya  years ago when his vehicle rolled over after spinning out of control on oil. He survived but two of his colleagues died. The accident brought to an end his career in the Army as a corporal with the Royal Signals, but after going through some struggles, he retrained to become a physiotherapist.  Mark was inspired by one of his clients inspired him to take part in the Invictus Games. Before the games he said: “To find out I’ve been elected to be captain, I had goosebumps from head to toe. “Whether we’ve got physical scars or the intangible burden of mental illness, they are our scars as well, but that’s our medals. “So we’re going to be going to the opening ceremony with our Union Jacks and our medals shown proudly.” Daniel, who is also competing in sitting volleyball, swimming, wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby, served as a Corporal with the British Army until he was medically discharged in . Following his injury, the -year-old from Milton Keynes found le incredibly dficult.

There were also crowds along Liverpool Street, while other people - and a cardboard cutout of Harry and Meghan - watched on from balconies as the royals arrived. The royals will receive a tour of the new education and interpretation facilities which is an enduring legacy to mark the th anniversary of the ending of the First World War. Meghan and Harry started the day yesterday at Bondi Beach where they met surfing community group OneWave, which raises awareness for mental health and wellbeing.After being presented with colourful garlands, the couple joined an ‘anti bad vibes circle’ where the prince joked that he ‘felt under-dressed’ for the occasion.Harry also told the group: “Each and every one of us will experience poor mental health, it doesn’t discriminate.” During their morning engagement at the beach Meghan, who was wearing a striped monochrome dress by Australian designer Martin Grant, told the group that she got up at .am to do yoga. She explained it was “so good for healing your mind” and said how being pregnant is “like having jet lag without actually travelling”.The Duke of Sussex’s tour of Australia reached new heights yesterday – as he and three Invictus Games competitors climbed the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge. Under sunny skies, Harry swapped the New South Wales standard for the Invictus flag at the top of the bridge, which sits  metres above the water. The Duke took  minutes to ascend the  steps to the top of the bridge along the east side, before crossing the central walkway to raise the flag which flapped in the breeze. He and the Duchess of Sussex also visited Macarthur Girls High School on the fourth day of their Royal Tour in Australia, and were impressed by what they saw. Meghan praised the girls projects, which include including making boxes of supplies for women in need, and said they made her proud.

Wayne Richards, , was hurt in a match on a public playing field in a Penygroes RFC friendly away game against Ammanford RFC. The self-employed builder told how everyone was worried dog dirt had got into his open fracture giving him a strong chance of infection. And the winger says people were telling him he could risk having to have his leg amputatedit became infected, Wales Online reports.  Luckily, whatever was on his sock did not cause an infection in his leg. But Wayne is still in a dficult situation as he is going to be unable to work for the next six to nine months Yet his situation could have been far worse. A photograph of his broken leg with his rugby sock appearing to be smeared in dogs mess was shared and debated widely on Twitter after his injury. The man who tweeted it had written: Compound fracture and dog s*** don’t mix! Top Welsh rugby referee Nigel Owens replied tweeting his support for the councils and clubs trying to ban dogs from their playing fields, replying: Agree %. No need to walk them on the actual field walk around and clean up the mess after. WalesOnline tracked Wayne down after following the reaction to the photograph on Twitter.  He says doctors told him that had there been an infection, his leg could have had to be amputated. Yet Wayne described the fear that gripped him as he lay on the pitch. When I collided everyone heard the bone snap and I was worried straightaway, he said. Everyone was worried dog mess had got in and there was a strong chance of infection as it was an open fracture. I felt faint and couldnt remember much, but both teams stopped and the referee called off the game straight away and called the ambulance. He added: The wait for the ambulance was tough and the whole time I was worried about my leg. People were saying I may have to have my leg amputatedit had caught an infection, that was worrying. On the way to the hospital I was worried as the paramedics werent sure what had gone in to my leg. It was only when we got to the hospital and they had done their scans we found out there was no dog mess. The doctors told me I was lucky asthere was an infection, my leg could have been amputated.  Even though Wayne was lucky that whatever was on his leg did not cause an infection, it has still played into the row about how councils should stop dog owners allowing their pets to foul on playing fields. Cardf council is proposing to ban dogs from the councils playing fields and the Vale council is also planning to introduce public space protection orders to force owners to clear up after dogs, put them on leads in defined areas and exclude them from specied locations. The plans have met with fury among many dog owners who call for enforcement of the existing rules rather than draconian new ones that will penalise the responsible as well as the irresponsible. Yet they have been welcomed by many sports clubs. Club secretary Neil Armstrong, from Penygroes, says they have had long standing issues with irresponsible dog owners. We are always telling dog owners to keep their dogs off the pitch as there has been a long issue. Most dog owners understand but some are irresponsible. When cutting the grass, dog owners have become aggressive and I have even had to call the police. Mr Richards, added:I have two dogs myself, I absolutely love dogs but letting them loose on park pitches is dangerous. The issue I want to highlight is about dog owners on rugby pitches.  Penygroes councillor Dai Thomas says the council are considering putting signs up to warn dog owners. Ninety percent of dog owners are responsible and will clean up after their pet, but some arent and this is who were appealing to. Weve had plenty of issues and this has been going on for a while. Loads of rugby matches have had to be called off at half time due to the excess amount of dog mess. Dog owners have been issued with penalty charges and we hope this will send a message. The council’s executive board member for public protection, Cllr Philip Hughes said: “The majority of dog owners clear up after them, however, there are a minority that show total disregard to their communities and it is totally unacceptable. If you have witnessed a dog incident and wish to pass information on to us, then please report it online  . We will continue to use our powers to fine anyone who is caught in person or through information linked to CCTV footage not cleaning up after their dog.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast enjoy balmy","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Met Office predicts last chance to enjoy sunshine this weekend before cold snap arrivesTemperatures could hit C in parts of the UK this weekend, but it will be \"noticeably colder\" on MondayShareCommentsByPaul Byrne:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video could-britains-last-good-weekend-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSoak up every moment of the balmy autumn weather this weekend because a cold snap is coming.

Elina Childs took full advantage of the first day of cannabis legalisation, selling munchies as people were stood in a queue outside a shop. The savvy nine-year-old, from Edmonton, sold all  boxes in less than  minutes, earning for the youth organisation. She and her father Seann had filled a wagon with sandwich biscuits and mint thins to satisfy the cannabis users eventual cravings.  They were surprised how quickly they were snapped up outside Nova Cannabis. Elina and her dad went down to the shop after school, and they walked up and down the queue selling the biscuits for a box. Elina said the whole experience was fun, while her dad revealed he borrowed the idea from Boy Scouts who sold biscuits to cannabis smokers when the drug was legalised in Calornia, US. Seann told CTV News: “We were going to sell them in the neighbourhood and it’s always been a little slow. Elina was actually bit by a dog once.  “She did a fantastic job and was very polite and everyone was very polite with her. He said the experience helped to teach his daughter about legalisation. In a separate interview, he told the Canadian Press: “People thought it was awesome. There were people telling her she was doing a great thing, that it was very innovative. There were cars stopping on the street to buy cookies from her. It was really something . I’d never seen anything quite like that.” He added: We like to have frank discussions with her, so she understands what it is and take away that mystery behind it. Just to show her people of all ages and all walks of le are doing this and its legal in Canada now, just demysty it for her so its not a big deal for her.  Elina has cystic fibrosis and the Brownies programme has helped to keep her active, Seann said. He told CTV that smoking is normally harmful to her, but this was “the one day she could benefit from smoking. Afterwards, Elinas strategy was praised by a local Girl Guides official.

She opted to steer clear of touching the animal. There have since been reports that Meghan was banned from cuddling the koala because it could have given her chlamydia. While its true that the infection is a major threat to Australias koala population - and is transmitted sexually in the same way as human chlamydia - its not possible for a person to catch it.  Theres one major reason Meghan didnt hold the cuddly bear - and its that its forbidden for anyone to do so in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Sydney is in New South Wales, so its against the rules of Taronga Zoo for guests to have a cuddle. Tourists can do so in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. When Kate and Will visited the same zoo in  with Prince George, the Duchess of Cambridge beamed as she stroked a koala - and even had a snf of him.  It might simply be that Meghan isnt a massive fan of animals. Or maybe she didnt want to have to wash her hands again. However, it is true she might have been warned against getting too close to the animal as, even though they cant transmit chlamydia to humans, they can pass on a second strain of bacteria, C. pneumoniae. If an infected koala were to, say, urinate on someone - though its unlikely - they can possibly pass on the strain, which is one of the leading causes of pneumonia in the world, to humans. So maybe pregnant Meghan was worried about catching pneumonia from the koala - and not an STI. Its not knownRuby was infected with the disease, but its unlikely considering shes given birth to a baby. Australian biologists discovered an outbreak of chlamydia in koalas in  and it is now believed that between % and % of the creatures test positive.

The royals have strict rules about behaviour during engagements and there are certain things they simply arent meant to do - including hugging people. According to a recent documentary by HBO, the Royals have a strict policy of not sharing hugs with members of the public. They do however, shake hands with them often. But so far in Australia, Harry,  and Meghan, , have broken this rule several times. The most interesting time was in Melbourne, when the Duke of Sussex approached a -year-old woman in the crowd at the Royal Botanic Gardens.India Brown was holding a sign which proclaimed: Been here since am, loved you since I was eight. The university student got emotional when Harry came over to talk to her and promptly burst into tears. She asked the prince for a hug and to her complete shock he agreed - even though he knew it would get him into trouble. Harry and Meghan were also pictured hugging a little boy during their visit to Dubbo.Five-year-old Luke Vincent, who has Downs syndrome, stole the show as he rushed to cuddle the couple and melted hearts as he playfully rubbed the princes beard.The Duke and Duchess also dished out hugs for an excited welcoming party of  flag-waving local schoolchildren at the town’s airport.

Taylor and Kern Lehman,  and , believe the similarities are drawn because she looks like the actress, they have age-gap relationships and that they are a striking couple. The pair from Phoenix, Arizona, USA, started flirting at a bar five years ago but never expected their rebound fling to turn into marriage. After discovering a shared love for music, travelling and having fun partying, the pair quickly moved in together and now have been married for over a year. Taylor met her other half through best friend Amanda, , who is the daughter of Kern - and despite having rocky patches, the three now get along again.  The couple who have been mistaken for father and daughter once, now also have the support of their families despite initial concern and shock. Taylor said: When we first met, I worked with Kerns daughter, she was my best friend and he was married at the time. I was also in a relationship. At first I thought he was very handsome. I have always been attracted to older guys. He thought I was cute, and we started flirting at the bar.  Amanda and I had been friends for a year before I got with her dad, so I did have a lot of guilt and felt bad at first. But over time I have gotten over that. She knows I will always be there for her in her le and problems. Kern is very handsome, and I adore how he carries himself, hes so educated, smart and successful. Our similarities between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas , I think are more apt for me than him. They have a similar age gap to us. She is brunette and he has silver hair, like us, but Kern is way better looking than Michael Douglas. People have told us we look like them while vacationing and that we are a very striking couple.  Weve only had one experience of people confusing our relationship, it was when we closed on our Calornia home, the notary said, Your daughter can fill this out or sign here We started laughing and Kern told her, shes my we and the notary felt stupid. At the beginning my parents were kind of concerned, my mom was upset that this was my friends dad, but they know Ive always dated older men. But time heals everything though and my mom, dad and step mom have visited us and are all fine with it.  For Taylor it took a while to get used to the stares of strangers most age gap couples are met with. But over time she adapted and now doesnt care what others think. Taylor said: When we first got together I was very insecure, I felt everyone was staring or questioning us, but that was only because it was new. People stare at us, but I think its because when we are both dressed up we are a good-looking couple. Taylor admits that she was surprised they got engaged and then tied the knot last year, in an intimate -person ceremony in Cancun, Mexico. She said: We found out we had a lot in common, but I dont think either of us expected we would get married. We thought it would be a rebound thing for us both. But, we hit it off, we like the same music and are both old souls. I fell in love with him for his personality, it made him so attractive to me. He is fun, outgoing, we both like to party, and he was charming. I appreciate his age, wisdom and also, the security we have as a couple.  Instead of considering children in their future, Taylor says the loved-up duo are happy with their the freedom their lestyle allows them from partying to date nights and exploring the world. She added: Why would I want to change at that part of his le, honestly I love my le, we enjoy the freedom of traveling and having fun together. Every year we spend a week in Mexico, its fun but its a party. We have a lot of alcohol and fun. I am very domesticated too. Love being home, cooking and house work. We both take pride in our home and hosting. With an age gap of -years between them, the couple have had to speak about the possibility that Kern could pass away before her and lay out future plans.  Taylor said: We met with a trust and will attorney, its something not a lot of mid-s women have to deal with and its pretty hard. But who knows what will happen. Tomorrow is never promised. I could go first tomorrow by a freak accident or anything. Feeling content with the lives ahead of them, the pair are due to celebrate their second wedding anniversary in May. Kern, a retiree, said: Taylor has a great sense of humour, is vivacious and an old soul. She also has a huge heart and is fiercely loyal. Also she is my best friend and is very easy to talk to about anything.  I didnt really have any reservations, and whether Amanda realizes it or not she was largely responsible for our meeting. Neither Taylor or I really expected it to develop into what it did at the time. When it did, my attitude was that Ive done a lot for my children, but choosing my mate is not within their purview. Kern advises others in age gap relationships to ignore people who look down or judge their love. He said: If it makes you happy and you click, its nobodys business but yours andpeople want to be judgmental the hell with them. Leave them in their glass house.

win at Hamilton – Dundee’s only league win of the season.And the Irish centre-back insists he wants to maintain those good displays under Macca as they look to rise from the foot of the table, starting at Livingston today.“With the new manager coming in it’s been quite positive and bubbly,” the -year-old said.“We had a quick chat with what the manager expects of us and what way he wants us to play.“We’ve had some good training sessions, full of energy and enjoyable.“As professional footballers we have to be ready for all kinds of situations and, either way, we knew we were going to be in on Wednesday morning and had games to prepare for.“From Tuesday when Neil McCann left there was no real indication the turnaround was going to be so quick but it was training as normal.“With the international break over the past week it was a bit of a surprise on Tuesday when the news broke but it’s just one of those things.“Neil was great at the time when he was here, in the short time I got to work with him.“We need to move on now, though, because we’ve got big games coming up over the next few days.”Newly-promoted Livi are flying high under manager Gary Holt and sit in fth place in the Premiership table on  points,  ahead of the Dark Blues.Their former-player manager Kenny Miller is now on the books of Dundee and Boyle admits the players have been using the hitman’s experience ahead of a game he feels they need to get a result from.He added: “Lads will probably speak to Kenny and ask him about what they’ll face in their dferent positions.“Since I’ve been here Kenny’s been brilliant, he knows the game very well and has a huge pedigree in the game so he’s a big help.“Livingston have the articial pitch and that will be dficult compared to what we’re used to but we showed against Hamilton that we can play on that.“We know it’ll be a test for us because, obviously, they have gone so well at the start of the season.“It’s a game we believe we can get a positive result from.”And the Dee will be hoping they can pick up some points as it doesn’t get any easier with current league leaders Hearts coming to Dens Park on Tuesday night.Although they’ve not had much of a chance to train as a group under Jim and have been out of the swing of regular matches because of the international break, Boyle feels they’ll be ready for the challenge of playing two games in four days.Boyle said: “As players you want to play as many games as possible.“You’d rather play games than train and the Saturday-Tuesday is a chance to get maximum points on the board and that’s the way we’ve got to look at it now.“It’s important now to get results and try to climb the table.“We’ve picked up of late and we have the confidence going into today that we’re more than capable of getting a result.“We’ll, hopefully, take that into Tuesday but today’s game is first and foremost.“It’s a massive game for us.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bc86768bcec3.jpg ","title":"former dundee goalkeeper derek soutar has forgiven jim mcintyre for dundee united goal","story":"Jim McIntyre broke his heart in one of the most crucial Dens Park derbies ever, but former goalie Derek Soutar is happy to deal with the now and gives his backing to the newly-appointed Dundee manager.During a playing career that saw him spend five years over the road at Dundee United, McIntyre made a habit of scoring goals against the Dark Blues.Few were more important than his April  winner that proved vital in the Tangerines staying in the top flight that season – at the expense of their city rivals.And it’s a painful memory for “Soapy”, who was in the home goal for that - defeat.For him, though, it’s all about what McIntyre can do for the team he remains an avid fan of and not about what happened in the distant past.He’s hopeful his fellow-Dee supporters adopt the same attitude and get right behind the new gaffer.“Thanks for bringing that up, it’s not one of the derbies I prefer to recall but I do remember Jim scoring that winner and it wasn’t a nice feeling,” he said.“He was always a dangerous player we had to watch out for in derbies and you have to be honest about it, a lot of Dundee fans won’t have forgotten that.“But now it’s about what he can do for our club and I’m surehe can get a few quick wins and get the team up the table a bit the fans will be right behind him.“He’s not the first manager, even in Dundee, who’s taken over at a team that were his rivals when he was a player, it’s part of football and it’s not something that stopped them going on to have success.“And going on to manage a club you were a favourite at is no guarantee of success – sadly we’ve just seen that with Neil McCann.“I was sorry to see him go because he’s someone I like as a person, who I knew had a real feeling for Dundee and wanted to play good football but things just didn’t work out.“Now the board have turned to Jim and, as well as being a manager whose teams can play attractive stuff, he’s one who knows the importance of results. Particularly right now, he’ll be working to get them and get Dundee out of this hole they’re in and, as time passes, he’ll worry about how it looks.”Soutar points outDundee drew up a profile of the man they needed, McIntyre would be one of those who came closest to ticking all the necessary boxes.“Jim’s now an experienced manager with knowledge of the Premiership and he’s been successful. I know he got the sack at another of my old clubs, Ross County, last year, but it was a harsh decision.“I’ve a lot of time for Roy McGregorand he’s a man who hasn’t made many mistakes up there.“Getting rid of Jim and Billy Dodds was one and I think when he looks back on that he’d probably agree.“As for Jim himself, he is a proud man who will work very hard to put things right a Dundee.“What happened at County will have hurt him and he’ll be determined to prove he still has a lot to offer – I think he has.“In the past he’s got the best out of players and while he’s inheriting a few good ones at Dens, I think it’s fair to say there are a few others who’ve under-achieved.”Soutar’s also convinced Dundee are getting a man whose stock in Scottish football remains high, and rightly so.“While he’s been out of the game he’s been linked with a few clubs andsome of them chose to go another way, I know he knocked back a few offers because they weren’t right for him.“He’s wanted to get back in at a club where he feels he can achieve something in the top ision and Dundee fans can be happy he thinks we fit that bill.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bc99e098fe91-846x564.jpg ","title":"found at car wheel with open buckfast","story":"A man has admitted getting behind the wheel of a car while more than four times the alcohol limit.Paul Milne, , was found slumped in his parked car with a bottle of Buckfast and vodka on Clepington Road on July  this year.He admitted being in charge of the vehicle after having  mics of alcohol in mls of breath, exceeding the limit of  mics.Dundee Sherf Court heard that the police were alerted to Milne by two delivery drivers who were concerned about his appearance while within the vehicle.Fiscal depute Charmaine Gilmartin told Sherf Alastair Brown: “Two takeaway drivers saw the accused’s vehicle parked on Clepington Road and they thought they had seen alcohol within the car.“They brought it to the attention of police officers who attended five minutes later who traced him within the car.“His head was slumped forward and the keys were in the ignition.“They could see an open bottle of Buckfast and a bottle of vodka in the car.“He smelled strongly of alcohol and was unsteady on his feet.”Milne failed a roadside breath test and later provided the reading at police headquarters.Solicitor Kevin Hampton said Milne, formerly of Strathmartine Road but now residing at Jericho House on Artillery Lane, had struggled with alcoholism and was taking active steps to tackle his drinking.He said: “There’s a long-standing alcohol problem which he now seems to be tackling and is doing quite well.“He got to the stage where he realised he was out of control.“He has taken the steps to move into Jericho House and that is where he is residing at the moment.”Sentence was deferred on Milne until November  in order to gather criminal justice social work reports.He was additionally disqualied from driving in the interim."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/Lee-Wilkie-column.jpg ","title":"lee wilkie called out dundees board hours before neil mccann was sacked","story":"In words that now appear almost prophetic, in his column on Monday the Tele’s Lee Wilkie sent a clear message to Dundee that trying to force an experienced new assistant on manager Neil McCann would end badly.Within hours of that appearing, the manager had been sacked after the club admitted attempts to “support” him had not come to fruition. vw, px\"  Now Wilkie has praised McCann for supporting existing No  Graham Gartland by effectively falling on his own sword along with him.While accepting after a dreadful start to the season the pair can have few complaints over their sacking, the former Dark Blue has praised McCann for his bravery.Wilkie said: “If Dundee were wanting Neil to get rid of Graham Gartland and bring in someone  to their liking, he has done the right thing and I do admire him for that.“Ultimately, results are the responsibility of the manager and no one  and it would not have been right for Gartland to carry the can – evenhe’d kept his job with another coach coming in, it would have undermined his position.“It means they’ve both gone and I’m sure Neil realised that would be the casehe took the stance he seems to have – so it took guts.“And I am sorry to see him go because he’s a person I like and I also liked the way he wanted his team to play football.“In the end, though, it’s a results business and he knows that as well as anyone. As much as I would defend his view on the way the game should be played, I can’t defend his results and I can see why Dundee felt they had to move to make a change.“They probably could have gone about it better because, as I said yesterday, when you try to bring in someone and the manager isn’t up for it, it won’t work.“It’s happened at other clubs from time to time and the end result is usually that the manager goes.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bc99da315efe-376x564.jpg ","title":"mums horror as brick misses baby by inches","story":"A young mum has described the terrying moment a brick smashed through her window and landed only inches from her baby’s head.Roxanne Montague was in her living room with her -month-old son Mason when the object came crashing into her home.The -year-old said she had heard shouting outside her house on Ballantrae Road in Douglas moments before the missile smashed through the glass.Roxanne said: “It was terrying. My heart has never beaten so fast.“My baby could have been killed. The brick landed inches from Mason’s head.“Shards of broken glass from the broken window also came flying towards him.“Instinctively I just flung myself across his body to try to protect him.“I hadn’t a clue what was going on and was terried that the brick might be followed by another one or by more missiles.“I have never been so scared.”Roxanne said the brick was thrown by a woman who she had seen shouting outside at someone.“The next thing she pushed over a garden wall and picked up a brick that had fallen off,” she added.“Then she hurled it towards my house. It was a dreadful thing to do to anyone.“I dread to think what might have happenedthe brick or the flying glass had been only a few inches closer to Mason.“He could have been killed or seriously hurt.“How anyone could do something like this with an innocent baby in the house is just awful.”I was shaking like a leaf afterwards.“I was so scared and little Mason was so upset by everything.“I called the police and they immediately came to the house.”A spokesman for Police Scotland said: “We attended at an address on Ballantrae Road in the early hours of Wednesday morning in response to reports of an assault and a vandalism.“A number of witnesses were traced and spoken to.“Officers are following a positive line of inquiry and the investigation is continuing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"paul mcmullan looking to put fizz in dundee uniteds league form","story":"When it’s put to him ‘seeing it was Irn-Bru Cup weekend so no-one should be surprised he turned in a Man-of-the-Match performance at Partick Thistle’, Paul McMullan manages a wry smile.Particularly under previous boss Csaba Laszlo, it was often only in that competition – the least important to Dundee United – the attacker got the chance to show what he could do over the whole  minutes.And while, more often than not, he responded by being the best player on the park, it became increasingly obvious it was not going to provide a route back to a regular starting slot in the all-important Championship campaign.Accordingly, it goes without saying he was delighted that United’s impressive win over the Jags was in a re-arranged league outing and not the fizzy cup.And for him to be involved so prominently in new boss Robbie Neilson’s first outing in charge was a signicant bonus.“It’s better to be doing well in a league game than the Irn-Bru Cup and I thought all the boys were brilliant against Thistle,” said the former Scotland U  man.“It’s a boost as well to be in the team for the manager’s first game. I’m really thankful to him for giving me it and, hopefully, I took it and did well.“Now we want to follow it up with another good performance against Inverness this week.”McMullan’s sparkling display saw him at the centre of much of United’s attacking display. He also grabbed an assist for the winning goal when Jags keeper Cammy Bell couldn’t hold his shot, allowing Pavol Safranko to net the rebound, making a mockery of last month’s revelation that United were willing to let him go in the summer.At the time he stated his plan was to get his head down and work hard to get back in the side before re-assessing his position during the January transfer window, when he’d be into the last six months of his contract.On that score, nothing has changed but, having been given his chance by the new boss, his hope is regular involvement from now on will see the matter resolved by a new deal at United.And he knows the best way to earn that is via regular performances like his last.“I’ve always had the belief in my ability and what I have to do is keep trying to play well.“On Saturday the manager gave me a more central role and it was good fun. You get a wee bit more of the ball and, when you do get on it, you can go both ways and I enjoyed that.”Even after just a few days working with Neilson, the -year-old is firm in his belief, what’s about to unfold at Tannadice is something every player there will want to be part of.“I think Saturday was a sign of things to come and we’re only going to get better from now on.“All the boys are champing at the bit to be involved and that’s definitely what you want because we’ve got a lot of good players here.“Right from the start on Saturday I thought we looked really good, we were creating chances. One thing where we were maybe lacking was converting them and it’s something we can work on.“But we did create a few, maybe should have had another couple of goals and we had one that was just offside as well and it’s good we’re making them.“We had to battle for the last  minutes or so and you do get a bit nervy when they pull a goal back and because it’s late on you go a bit more defensive.“Probably the fact we’d been so much on top makes you more anxious because you don’t want to throw away two points but we stuck together and saw the game out.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/strathartine-rbs-846x564.jpg ","title":"rbs queues chaotic","story":"RBS customers have been left waiting in line as the bank’s last remaining Dundee branches struggle to cope with demand.Complaints of long queues snaking out of the bank’s High Street and Strathmartine Road branches have led to claims RBS blundered when it closed other local services.Pictures have emerged, showing a long line of customers waiting to be served at the city centre RBS.Alan Morgan, , who has been using the High Street bank for more than eight years, claimed customers have been waiting as long as  minutes to make a transaction.He said: “Regardless of what time of the day I go in, there is a line of at least  people.“If the self-service ATMs aren’t working, I’ve seen myself waiting for at least  minutes to get served.“There are only ever two bank tellers on.

So it’s proved with the former Scotland star at Dens Park.That he had very definite ideas on how the game should be played was clear, as was the fact he was unlikely to change them.He demanded his team focused on a passing game all over the pitch, making it clear he’d accept responsibilityit meant risks taken in playing the ball out from the back at times led to goals being conceded. Inevitably it did.In fairness to McCann, his arrival did bring about a speedy and necessary improvement and wins over Motherwell and Kilmarnock followed by a draw with Ross County were enough to save the team from relegation in the   season.Two defeats would follow before the end of the campaign and while they were largely irrelevant to a relieved support, they did perhaps suggest to the caretaker boss that, long-term, the changes he wanted to make were going to be too big an ask.That led to a confusing summer that initially saw him announce he did not want the job, moves be made for then-St Mirren boss Jack Ross, before McCann had a change of mind and was appointed on a permanent basis.Crucially, that saw time wasted in undertaking what was a clearly necessary rebuilding of the squad. That left him playing catch-up when it came to new signings.It meant despite talk of better to come, with the exception of a brief spell around February, hopes of a top-six challenge gave way to another battle for survival.It was achieved via three wins from the first four post-split fixtures but, even so, it was clear better was expected this season.Another summer of signings this year gave some hope that would be the case but, although progression from the Betfred Cup group stage was secured, a home defeat at the hands of Championship Dunfermline and a lack of goals were worrying.Performances in opening league games against St Mirren and Aberdeen were decent but both ended in defeat.Then an inept and ill-disciplined display against Ayr in the last  of the Betfred Cup that saw three goals conceded and two red cards had the alarm bells ringing.After that the defeats continued coming. There was brief respite via a solitary success at Hamilton last month but he departs having lost eight of his last nine fixtures.If that was not bad enough, his time in charge saw stories of discord in the dressing-room and bust-ups with ious players during his time in charge didn’t help.Most notably was the argument that led to star goalie Scott Bain’s time at Dens coming to an abrupt end. Now McCann and assistant Graham Gartland have paid the price."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/DNic_UNESCO_V-846x564.jpg ","title":"unesco delegates from across the world visit dundee","story":"Dozens of delegates from fellow Unesco cities of design across the world have been given a tour of Dundee’s new £ million VA museum.Hailing from as far afield as Australia, Canada, China and South Africa, the visitors were in Tayside as part of a collaboration between design-savvy cities.Of all the  cities to hold the accolade, the delegates voted to visit Dundee, which was named a Unesco city of design in  and is the only place in the UK with the honour.Robin Jutzen, who works in enterprise and investment for the City of Cape Town, was among the international visitors.He last visited Dundee more than  years ago on a school rugby tour aged  and noted the “out-standing change” since.“The transformation from then to now is utterly astounding,” he said.“The VA itself is amazing.

In order to preserve the trees in our woodland, we were advised to install the doors into tree stumps but I think it still looks really effective.“It’s hard to tell how popular the trail has been so far, as there is no measure for footfall, but online particularly the response has been all positive.”Louise, mum to six-year-old Jessica and three-year-old Chloe, was keen for the project to appeal to both young boys and girls.She said: “I wanted it to appeal to everyone and so we have been explaining to children that the fairies and elves live together in the woods.“I have always taken my children for walks and I am passionate about spending time with them outdoors.“We are so lucky to have this amazing countryside on our doorstep.”As well as encouraging more children into the great outdoors, Louise hopes the back story will inspire people to look at Dunnottar’s history.She said: “We have put up a sign at the start of the trail weaving the story of the fairies and elves with Dunnottar’s Kennedy family history.“Our story goes that the  children in the Kennedy family, who once owned the woods, met the Fairy Queen and they had adventures together.“The Kennedy family took such good care of the elves and fairies, that even after the family left, the mythical creatures ed to spread their magic for the local children.“I hope this will be an inspiration for my children and perhaps their legacy.”The Dunnottar Woodland Park management committee, which bought the doors from a specialist company in London, has urged visitors to the trail to be gentle when knocking on the doors, and encourages dog walkers to supervise their pets around the delicate features.Neil Taylor, a member of the Forest Enterprise Scotland team in the area, said: “These are great little additions to the woodland that really captivate imaginations – young and old.“They help make young people look really closely at their surroundings and that’s a great way to start getting them to notice other things about a woodland, too.“And who knows – maybe during your next walk in the woods, one of them might open and reveal a surprise resident.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hunt after second betting shop raid","story":"Masked raiders who robbed an Aberdeen bookies dropped cash as they fled the scene on foot.Eyewitnesses said banknotes from the raid on the William Hill shop in Summerhill were seen fluttering in the air as the two men raced across a busy road.A major police probe has been launched into what was the second raid on a city bookmaker in less than  hours.Detectives are keeping an open mind about whether the incidents – just a mile apart – were related, but admitted they shared similarities.A number of customers were in the Summerhill Court shop when two men, thought to be in their late s and dressed in black, entered at around .am yesterday.It is understood less than £ was taken.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners.

The outbreak in Girvan has sparked panic among business owners battling to control the vermin. Hygiene chiefs this week slapped an emergency order on the town’s derelict former bingo hall housing the filth. And furious community leaders say the pest problem is turning their town into a no-go zone. Bill Logan, who heads Girvan’s Youth Trust, said: “We’re trying to promote ourselves as a tourist town which is open for business. “How can you do that with rats running all over the street and into shops  “I feel for businesses – it’s ridiculous they should have to put up with this.” The long-running decay of the former bingo hall and cinema was highlighted this week when rats were spotted running loose.

It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring their two goal cushion via a poacher’s finish from point blank range.In a breathtaking finish, the Pupils gained a second penalty with minutes remaining however, resisting the urge to change the kicker, Gary Grumoli placed his second effort to the keeper’s opposite side, only to see his kick saved dramatically.It was the final act of an uninspiring, but ultimately exciting game.The Pupils will try to put the cup disappointment behind them when they travel to play old foes, Hillington, in a league fixture tomorrow.Ellis Robertson played a solid game in the centre. _cpupilsvkinrossRyan

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

Typically, schools did The Daily Mile three to five times per week ndash dropping it on days where PE was already scheduled.The findings of both studies are to be included in a new guide explaining why schools should consider introducing the scheme, and how best to do so.Dr Gemma Ryde, Lecturer in Physical Activity and Health in Sport at Stirling, said: ldquoThis is the first study to explore why The Daily Mile might have been so successfully implemented, ldquoOur research suggests that this success can be attributed to the simple core intervention components ndash allowing the children to walk, jog or run flexible delivery that supports teacher autonomy and adaptability that suits the specic primary school context..The teachers interviewed told researchers about how they had implemented the scheme and the obstacles and benefits encountered during the process. In addition, the scientists recorded information on the schoolsrsquo grounds and facilities.All the schools carried out  minutes of activity, with one participant noting that the intervention is actually time and not distanced based, as suggested by the name.This was perceived as being short enough to not interfere too much with the school day and ndashthe children were running ndashthen they achieved approximately one mile during this period.Staff at one school in the study said while they initially had the children completing an actual mile, it took some children too long or was too dficult for them to complete the distance.Allowing walking, jogging or running catered for all abilities. One interviewee said: ldquoIt catered for all abilitieshellip the ones that maybe are a bit slower, because yoursquoll get out there and some of the kids will just run around and they want to know how many laps they can do. Whereas, yoursquove got other ones that are happy just to walk.One of the schools which had struggled with introducing activity had tried to implement a Daily Skip, because of a lack of playground space for running. However, the alternative scheme proved ldquovery challenging for ious reasons, including: the cost of equipment the logistics of managing the skipping ropes and the skills required to skip, researchers said.ldquoThese challenges, which move away from the original simple design, plus other demands from within the curriculum, meant that The Daily Skip was only happening sporadically,at all, Dr Ryde said.The study says allowing teachers the autonomy to fit the Daily Mile into the school day and and change the route or surface according to factors such as the weather, was also an important factor.Dr Ryde added: ldquoThe Daily Mile appears to have several factors which may relate to its implementation success. These are important considerations for others looking to implement The Daily Mile effectively in their primary school or in other contexts.Elaine Wyllie, of the Daily Mile Foundation, said flexibility had always been key to her initial concept: ldquoI am delighted that the research undertaken by the University of Stirling has confirmed that The Daily Mile works best when it is put in place according to our core principles,\" she said. ldquoTheir research has shown that implementation should be kept simple,ldquoIrsquod like to thank the University of Stirling for carrying out this work and highlighting that the adoption of our straightforward approach ensures that children can enjoy all the benefits of The Daily Mile."},{"url":null,"title":"grave-of-forgotten-scots-hero-who-helped-abolish-slavery-finally-marked","story":"But outside the dusty tomes of academia, the extraordinary story of Zachary Macaulay has largely been forgotten.Now the final resting place of the pioneering activist ndash whose horric experiences in the Jamaican plantations and forensic attention to detail helped change the world forever ndash is to be marked for the first time with a memorial plaque.Born in Inveraray in , Macaulay overcame a misspent youth binge-drinking on the streets of Glasgow to become the governor of Sierra Leone, and later helped lay the foundations for the abolition of slavery in .His biographer Rev Dr Iain Whyte insists Macaulay provided the crucial ldquoammunition that allowed key figures such as William Wilberforce to force a change in the law.He said: ldquoHe collected the material and Wilberforce used it. I would have to say strongly that it would have taken longer to abolish slavery but for the campaigning of people like Zachary.Professor John Cairns of Edinburgh University argues Macaulays direct experience gave him ldquoan extra moral authority.Despite this, his vital role is often overlooked.A son of the manse, Macaulay left school at  and travelled to Glasgow to work in a merchantrsquos office ndash where he quickly fell in with a rowdy crowd and developed a taste for booze.Things took a turn for the worse when a mysterious, shameful event led him to pack his bags and head for Jamaica. Macaulay never ulged what happened, but some have speculated the teenager got a girl pregnant.In Jamaica, he worked as a ldquobookkeeper ndash or slave overseer ndash at a sugar plantation. Just  years old, he was at first horried by the brutality around him, but he hardened over time.It was only after he ed to Britain in  that he came into contact with anti-slavery campaigners and developed a fervent belief that the law must be changed. His guilt over his time in Jamaica would come to haunt him.Through working with the evangelical Clapham Sect ndash a group of abolitionists with the politician William Wilberforce at their centre ndash Macaulay was invited to visit Sierra Leone, the African colony established to provide a home for emancipated slaves. He became its governor while still in his mid-s.In , he ed to England on a slave ship to experience the conditions first-hand, and dedicated himself to abolition.The slave trade was outlawed across the British Empire in . But Macaulays work wasnt finished, and he went on to launch the monthly Anti-Slavery Reporter.His attention to detail and statistical know-how armed Wilberforce and the abolitionists with the facts they needed to argue the case for further reform in Westminster.Slavery itself was abolished in , and Macaulay died five years later. He was buried in a cemetery in London, but after the site became a public park ndash St Georgersquos Gardens ndash the exact location of his grave was lost.Now, to mark the th anniversary of his birth, a memorial plaque will be unveiled in the gardens after being donated by the Royal Statistical Society , the Friends of St Georgersquos Gardens, University College London and the Clan Macaulay Association.Sir David Spiegelhalter, president of the RSS, described him as an ldquounsung hero.

Askedthe whole deal could fall over this one point, he replied bluntly: \"My answer is yes.\"While the chief negotiator acknowledged a failure to get a Brexit deal would be ldquovery serious, very dficult for all of us in the EU, it would be ldquomuch more grave for Britain\".Challenged over whether no-deal would mean dramatic disruption, such as flights being grounded, he said: \"Emergency solutions would be found to establish a certain continuity but it would be extremely serious.\"Mr Barnier then stressed the negative essence of Britainrsquos decision to leave the European bloc.\"There is no added value in Brexit. It is a negative negotiation. No-one has been able to show me any added value in Brexit, not even Mr Farage.ldquoWhen I met him in my office at his request and I asked him: Show me how the decision to leave the EU provides solutions to the anxieties, discontents and sometimes the anger of the British people.\"He made clear he did not want to impose a hard Brexit on Britain, which he described as the ldquoabsence of a deal.\"But Brexit cant be soft. It has innumerable consequences. It was chosen by the British. Were they well informed at the time they voted  They were not told all the consequences even Mr Farage recognised that everything was not spelt out in the campaign.\"Mr Barnier said he believed that the Brexit vote was driven in part by \"nostalgia\" as well as the UKs desire to extricate itself from regulations, particularly in the financial sector, and popular anger over the impact of economic liberalisation.But David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary hit back, saying: \"I wouldnt confuse belief in the free market with nostalgia.Earlier, Jeremy Hunt rejected claims that Theresa May had \"capitulated\" in the face of EU demands.The Foreign Secretary insisted: \"The reason why this week has been dficult is because Theresa May has not buckled.

Mr Mundell is not a member of Mrs Mayrsquos inner team.At the EU summit on Thursday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, said a transition period extension would afford both sides more time to agree a trade deal and so avoid a backstop he added it \"probably will happen\".When the Scottish Secretary got wind of this possibility, he telephoned Downing Street and spoke to a top official, making clear his deep concern.A source close to Mr Mundell insisted there was no threat of resignation and suggestions to this effect were being ldquoovercooked, noting how there was at present no clarity about an extension. ldquoIts just an idea that has not been fleshed out,\" he said.However, one MP said there was deep alarm among Scottish Conservatives.ldquoThis is a red line for us, he declared. ldquoIf fishing were included in the extension period ndash and Brussels would want it to be - there is absolutely no way we could support it. It would mean us voting against the Government and David Mundell would probably resign.The backbencher said the Government had to know the  Scottish Conservative MPs were ldquowilling to flex their muscleswe are pushed into a corner.He added: ldquoFishing is a totemic issue in Scotland and I can see myself going through the lobbies against the Governmentneed be which is not something I ever thought I would hear myself say.Another Scottish Tory MP was equally adamant that he too would vote against the Governmentfishing were not exempted from a transition extension. ldquoYes, I would. I have already told the whips. All  of us feel the same way. I donrsquot know of any colleague who would not hold the line on this.A third MP pointed out how the Government had initially given its word that the UK would take back control of its fishing waters from December  but then it was pushed back to December  due to the transition period any further extension to December  would cost the party seats in Scotland. ldquoPeople would rightly feel betrayed by such a move, he declared.Simon Collins of the Shetland Fishermenrsquos Association made a similar point, saying the industry should ldquonot be let down again as it was under the s Heath Government and that the UK Government had given it a ldquocast-iron guarantee that Britain would become an independent coastal state on Brexit Day and leave the EUrsquos Common Fisheries Policy.ldquoIn March this year, we were told there is going to be an implementation period and yoursquore stuck shadowing the CFP until the end of .

No such information exists on the website.Mr Collins said: ldquoWhile debate on one of the central issues facing our country is part of a thriving democracy, there is an important question of where campaigning stops and political advertising starts.ldquoFacebook has recently announced a set of changes to increase transparency around political advertising on its .ldquoThis example offers Facebook an opportunity to show it is committed to making that change happen ndashyou are targeted with a message or asked to lobby your MP, you should know exactly who is behind the organisation asking you to do it.Rob Leathern, director of product management at Facebook, said: ldquoOn November , all advertisers will have new requirements before they can place political ads in the UK, including Mainstream Network.ldquoThese advertisers will need to confirm their identity and location through an authorisations process and accurately represent the organization or person paying for the ad in a disclaimer.ldquoThese steps must happen or the advertiser will be prevented from running ads related to politics on Facebook.

Well of course we didnrsquot know what we were voting for, as Britain had never previously conducted a vote on whether or not to remain in the EU. Andyou insist that those who voted to leave the EU were largely ignorant about the consequences and ramications of Brexit then the same could also be said for many who voted to Remain.How easily many Remainers choose to overlook the behaviour of the EU in bending Greece to its will, encouraged by German banks who expressed disgust at the profligacy and corruption they claimed led that country into financial distress. These same banks have since made euro. billion in interest payments on Greek bonds since . The German governmentrsquos own figures showed that Germany made euro.bn in interest payments on these bonds ndash purchased in a deal to keep the Greek economy afloat ndash while paying Greece less than eurobn. There are benefits to be had from being in the EU but, as ever, some benefit more than others.Some Remainers also become haughty when citing their reasons for holding a second referendum. In this they can barely conceal their liberal disdain for those of their fellows who unconscionably voted to leave. They portray them as a bunch of ignorant, racist and ill-educated northerners who were incapable of understanding the consequences of Brexit. Their barely-concealed glee at every presentiment of evil that may yet afflict those northern communities has been sickening.Yet, like their manufactured concerns for the future of Ireland Irsquove rarely heard any of the metropolitan elites previously profess to be overly-vexed by the challenges faced by working-class communities in Englandrsquos north-west or north-east. Where were they when the fishing fleets on Humberside disappeared, sacriced to enable the US to spy on Soviet submarines from the Icelandic coast  And beyond some hand-wringing and anti-Thatcher sloganising what did they actually do when the mines all shut and the car factories fell silent  Each time I see Gordon Brown wade into Brexit on his white charger I can still hear him say: ldquoBritish jobs for British workers. You also contributed to this, big man.Nothing wersquove seen in the British political and social landscape makes me think that a second EU referendum would bring a dferent result from the first one. The social problems encountered by Englandrsquos most disadvantaged communities are profound and figured massively in their reasons for choosing to exit the EU. These problems remain deep-rooted and those who think their reasons for voting Leave were forged solely on the big, fat NHS lie on the side of Boris Johnsonrsquos battle-buses are deluding themselves. And anyway,wersquore seriously talking about re-running the EU referendum on the claim that the idiot punters were fed myths and lies then letrsquos also have a look at every General Election held in the UK since the dawn of universal suffrage.Irsquom aware too that those of us who seek a second referendum on Scottish independence are on shaky ground here. Many of the reasons put forward for rejecting a second EU referendum might, with some justication, also apply to the prospect of a second Scottish one. And, having previously stated some obvious flaws in the arguments of recalcitrant Remainers Irsquoll refrain from pointing out the response which immediately comes to mind when Nicola Sturgeon talks about the craziness of leaving the worldrsquos most successful and robust trading confederation. Yet, there are some obvious dferences too which arguably justy a second independence referendum and a mandate too.Since September,  there have been three General Elections on either side of the Border: one for Holyrood and two for Westminster. In addition there has been a local government election. In Scotland the SNP, the only party campaigning for a second referendum, has triumphed in each of these elections comfortably. Four years on from the first referendum on Scottish independence there remains a pro-Yes majority at Holyrood. These alone constitute a mandate in anyonersquos language.Equally, there can be little doubt that the social and political terrain of the UK, as it affects Scottish citizens, has changed materially and that these changes have been profound and dramatic. As such, these take us well beyond any questions about not respecting the democratic vote of the first independence referendum. Wersquore not talking about seeking a second vote for fear of what might happen as a result of the first one but because of what actually has happened. The vote to leave the EU could stand alone here in justying a second independence referendum simply because two-thirds of Scots voted to remain.The most profound reason, though, has been evident for some time and will become critically so following Brexit, no matter what sort of deal is reached with the EU. While England has been in convulsions for a decade over the amount of migrants coming through its borders Scottish governments since  have been united behind one policy: we want them the more the merrier and we need to find ways of attracting them and persuading them to stay. They donrsquot need to earn poundk-a-year for the privilege and they wonrsquot need to know through which eye Harold had his brain skewered in . We need them because our population is ageing and there arenrsquot enough Scots paying enough to fund their care. When free movement of EU citizens stops post-Brexit the nation which voted overwhelmingly to permit will be worst affected by it.Unlike a second EU vote the second independence referendum will not be a choice between mere predicted scenarios. Instead it will determinewe wish to remain in a Union which has already changed dramatically.        name : ballot,target: ballot_,params:.push"},{"url":null,"title":"artificial-intelligence-could-help-create-more-specific-alzheimers-treatment","story":"Medics have devised a new algorithm that can automatically spot dferent patterns of progression in patients suffering from a range of dementias, including Alzheimerrsquos disease.The algorithm, called Subtype and Stage Inference ndash or SuStaIn, uses medical images to show doctors what stage the disease has reached and identy whether patients will respond better to certain treatments.Researchers said the algorithm was able to identy three separate subtypes of Alzheimerrsquos disease from MRI scans of people with dementia, and said this ldquosubtyping would be possible very early in the disease process.The ability to identy the subtypes early on in the disease process and using non-invasive MRI scanning means there is a better chance of identying the best treatment for iniduals, scientists said.ldquoOne key reason for the failure of drug trials in Alzheimerrsquos disease is the broad mixture of very dferent patients they test a treatment with a strong effect on a particular subgroup of patients may show no overall effect on the full population so fail the drug trial, said Professor Daniel Alexander at the UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing.ldquoThis new algorithm has the unique ability to reveal groups of patients with dferent iants of disease.Professor Jonathan Schott, from the UCL Institute of Neurology, said understanding how dferent diseases evolve over time is ldquocritical for the design of treatments and providing information to patients about their prognosis.ldquoThis is a major challenge for diseases that evolve over years,not decades, and where there may be substantial dferences in the underlying pathology, and pattern and rates of progression between patients, Professor Scott said.ldquoThis work shows that it is possible to tease out dferent disease patterns ndash some hitherto unknown ndash from single MRI scans taken from patients with a range of dferent dementias.The researchers are now looking for ways to apply the algorithm to other diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.It is believed the algorithm could be used by the NHS within the next few years.

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting. Unfortunately, Highland Council appears not to have.\"As a result, I have written to them to ask them to give further consideration to this approach, especially when the committee has heard how well this works in other areas.\"She added: \"While the Highland Council representative did note that there was engagement with the third sector, communities and citizen  for budgeting in the past, I am concerned that engagement, dialogue and meaningful consultation did not happen in the run-up to the budget process for this financial year.\"Im concerned that we are now close to the budget being presented to council and meaningful engagement has still not taken place.\"Highland Council plans to close  of its  public toilets to save pound, a year but opponents claim the move could lead to a visitor boycott.Campaigners delivered a ,-signature petition to Highland Council last month and claimed the proposal has already impacted the tourism sector.

A coach tour firm cancelled a booking over concern for its customers needing comfort breaks.As previously reported, local businessman Andrew Mackay said the threat of toilet closures in Caithness could create \"a negative impression\" of the area and impact on the number of people visiting.Mr Mackay, who has hotels in Wick, Thurso and Castletown and is a board member of the tourism body Venture North, said: \"The perception that there is a shortage of toilets in Caithness ndash and where in the Highlands ndash could impact adversely on the area.\"Any negative publicity could have an effect on the industry. We have a short season and need to capitalise on all markets.\"Green MSP John Finnie recently accused the council of pressing ahead with the closure of toilets in the face of its own evidence that it could have an impact on public health. An equality impact assessment conducted into the proposals identied issues for older people, those with disabilities and pregnant women.Mr Finnie said: \"Despite this, the council leadership are determined to press ahead in their usual incoherent manner, ignoring procedures, policies and good practice.\"Given the clear implications for public health, and potential for increased instances of public nuisance, it is astonishing that the council has not discussed this matter with NHS Highland and Police Scotland.\"Saturday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118016.jpg","title":"Marathon trek pays off for charity","story":"A THURSO man has raised more than pound for charity by walking coast-to-coast across Scotland.Douglas Fraser decided to raise awareness of prostate cancer and raise money at the same time.\"As I enjoy walking I decided to do a coast-to-coast walk across Scotland and ask the public to donate money.

The new strategy will shape the country’s transport priorities for the next  years.Age Scotland and Transport Scotland have said they have been working closely with older people in communities across island, rural and urban Scotland since spring to understand how transport affects older peoples’ daily lives.Gillian Skuse, Charity Director of Age Scotland Orkney, stressed how important it is that local older people get involved in these discussions.“We’ve heard from older people around the islands that transport can impact their mobility, running their errands, enjoying activities and being part of their local communities. This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed. Tea and coffee will be available on arrival from . am with the day starting at . am.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much.

Led by Sir Euan Brown and designed by Sir David Chipperfield, the centre will replace the Queen’s Hall as the Scottish Chamber Orchestra’s base and has financial backing from International Festival benefactor Carol Grigor and her Dunard Fund. Dunard is also bank-rolling opposition to the hotel plan for the old Royal High School and is at the heart of the scheme to turn it into a new home for the St Mary’s Music School, also with a public performance hall.Sold as a key component in securing the Edinburgh Festival’s place at the top of the global cultural league, and with an internationally renowned architect on board, Impact’s well-connected team might not have expected to encounter much resistance, but this week The Scotsman revealed the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland had lodged an objection because the new building will “tower above” Dundas House. “The proposal is too large and too tall for such a restricted plot ... and as such represents an overdevelopment of the site,” said the AHSS submission to the city council. : First look at Edinburgh’s new £m concert hallIf this is bad news for Impact, it’s good news for the new St James Centre whose developer, TH Real Estate , has been making a similar point for some months, arguing that the height of the hall will steal the view of St Andrew Square and George Street which their hotel was expecting to enjoy and was part of the design brief.THRE is also unhappy that large equipment trucks could access the concert hall through the currently pedestrianised Multrees Walk, something which was actually supported by the Edinburgh Design Panel when it met to discuss Impact last year. The alternative, for THRE to provide access through the St James Centre’s underground services entrance, received a predictably cool reception.It now appears that behind-the-scenes negotiations have failed, with St James development chief Martin Perry writing a letter to locals urging them to object. In turn, Impact is now said to be consulting its lawyers about its contents. “It is not proper for their letter to include inaccuracies which may mislead others,” Impact chair, Sir Euan Brown, told The Times. “This is extremely disappointing and we are taking appropriate action.” What those inaccuracies are is unclear, although it’s hard for THRE to argue about the adverse effect of the concert hall’s height on the city skyline when there will be no more dramatic alteration than the golden ribbon walnut whip turd design of the hotel at the heart of St James. But Impact faces its own challenge in arguing that such a massive construction, largely in concrete, is compatible with the surroundings when it has taken over a decade to get rid of the concrete monstrosity which was St Andrew’s House.: Edinburgh’s new concert hall is condemned by critics for being ‘too large and too tall’The Cockburn Association, so often at the heart of opposition to contemporary construction in the World Heritage site, has given its blessing and that means much hangs on the position of Historic Environment Scotland and the World Heritage Trust, whose director Adam Wilkinson has been keeping his head lower down on this issue than his prominent opposition to the Royal High School hotel scheme.At least the AHSS is being consistent in its opposition to both the Royal High hotel and the concert hall, because it’s not dficult to argue that the, well, ‘impact’ on the main High School building and Dundas House from the proposed modern additions is similar. It might be left to the members of the city council’s planning committee, of which I’m one, to decide what happens. As it stands, my mind is entirely open.ltblobgt Before that, this Wednesday my planning colleagues and I must decide whether to grant permission to the Gleneagles club and hotel proposal for the grand old Bank of Scotland office next door to Dundas House. Which means I can’t say anything about it.\u2028Who will empty my bin With some understatement, Edinburgh council’s head of place management, Gareth Barwell, informed councillors this week that changes to the council’s waste service “had been disruptive for many residents”. Those residents who still wonder when their bins will be emptied, as opposed to what it says in the council’s recent letter, might read “disruptive” as “utterly shambolic”. As for the new garden waste system which now costs £ a bin, mine is still outside on the street.SNP-Labour coalition rt deepens by the day\u2028Amidst the chaos, the rt between some Labour councillors and the SNP on Edinburgh council’s coalition administration is becoming deeper by the day, and is being played out publicly through the letters page of the Evening News. Now Cllrs Scott Arthur and Gordon Munro have not only accused colleagues of failing to speak up about Scottish Government funding cuts, but of interpreting opposition to education cuts as open attacks. Tellingly, they quote the council partnership agreement which requires the administration to lobby the Scottish Government to ensure adequate funding for local services and contrast the current leadership’s silence with ex-SNP leader Sandy Howat’s public criticism.This week they and their Labour colleagues face a further dilemma over a Conservative motion to examine options for suspending Primary One testing. Opposition puts them at odds with the national party so for once in this council, the local leadership might actually have to stand up for themselves and publicly reject SNP policy.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4817147.1539938228!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment glasgow people s palace closure would be symbol of austerity","story":"If a -year-old promise is broken and Glasgow#s People#s Palace closes, it would be a powerful symbol that austerity is still very much with us, despite Theresa May#s claim the end is in sight.As he opened the People’s Palace in , Lord Rosebery, a former Prime Minister, told a crowd of several thousand assembled on Glasgow Green that it would be “open to the people for ever and ever”, describing the building as “a palace of pleasure and imagination around which the people may place their affections and which may give them a home on which their memory may rest”.It may have survived two World Wars, economic recessions and a decade of austerity, but Rosebery’s optimistic pledge could be about to be broken. The adjoining Winter Gardens glasshouse needs multi-million-pound repairs and is to close indefinitely at the end of this year. A knock-on effect may also be the closure of the palace, although Glasgow City Council still hopes to prevent this.: Glasgow’s People’s Palace and Winter Gardens to close ‘indefinitely’Councillors all over Scotland will sympathise, given the pressures they have been under in recent years.Local authority spending on frontline services like school support, children’s services, rubbish disposal and social care has fallen by nearly £ million over the past five years – a . per cent cut that has been contrasted with the . per cent reduction in the Scottish Government’s revenue budget. The figures prompted local government body Cosla to complain in May that councils had “suffered the brunt of cuts” and had “no room left to manoeuvre in terms of budgets”.The Scottish Government, meanwhile, has sought to leave such complaints at the door of Theresa May according to Bute House, this is Tory, not SNP, austerity.For her part, the Prime Minister recently made an even more optimistic pledge than her predecessor, declaring the end of austerity was within our grasp –only the right Brexit deal could be struck.However, the closure of the People’s Palace would be a powerful symbol that our economic woes are very much still with us and that it is the “people” who continue to pay the highest price. The museum is famously home to Sir Billy Connolly’s ‘big banana boots’, but it also details the lives of everyday working-class Scots. One of its highlights is the Single End display, showing a typical single-roomed house of the s, where a family would eat, sleep, cook and wash. It acts as a reminder that austerity today is still an improvement on the past, but also a warning of how much worse le can be.

The “For You The War is Over” exhibition includes the sardonic diary kept by Lt Hamilton of the Gordon Highlanders who was caught at Le Maisnil near Lille in August  in one of the early battles of the First World War.He waswounded several times in the arm, back and leg and was held in Burg-bei-Magdeburg Officers’ Camp, where he remained until April . Lt Hamilton was involved in several escape attempts, including one in which he was free for ten days before he was recaptured. His diary, which appears courtesy of the Hamilton family, includes a memorable description of a mass escape attempt through a “coke chute”, which was foiled by the Germans in . “At Munden there was a coke chute – a circular tin thing, leading from a small room over the tailings to a small out house,” wrote Lt Hamilton. “They made a hole behind a piano in the partition of the wall into the small room from which the coke chute led. About ten Russians and [Lt] Templer then disappeared down this one night, ran the gauntlet of a sentry under an electric light and so out, cracking a civilian on the head with a beer bottle en route. They were not discovered next day, and so next night nearly all the Russians in the camp decided to go. They were surprised in the act by the Germans, the outhouse containing a dozen of them at that time, the room about sixty, and the tube three, one fat old major having successfully blocked the passage – being with dficulty extracted at the point of a bayonet.”Lt Hamilton also describes Hogmanay celebrations which included eating haggis and Scotch buns, but were regrettable for a lack of whisky.“Afterwards we danced reels in the passage to the delight of the Russians and the annoyance of the French in the room below, and ended up with a wee Dock  Doris and Auld Lang Syne. Quite a merry evening,” he wrote.Excerpts from diary of Private Andrew Clingan, th Battalion, Royal Scots, recount thoughts of home and thoughts of “escaping – the prisoner’s dream, the one thing behind all others for which he lives, and the great thing that keeps one alive in prison.”“For You the War is Over” opens on Monday at General Register House, Edinburgh, and runs until November .©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday.

And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !! How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#.

I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box. Tavish has already clearly stated he is in favour of democratic reform of SCT, just notit requires him to stand up against anyone local.You`re right there Peter, the money hasn`t just gone it`s been squandered!Squandered or plundered John  Aren’t the controls on the access to Shetland’s charitable funds so weak that any dedicated self serving group with a plausible plan could arrange over time to help themselves  Viking by name#We’ve got to get away from the notion that the funds exist to secure Shetland’s economic future. They exist to ameliorate social disruption resulting from the oil era. Vast infrastructure projects in remote rural communities bring almost random redistributions in wealth and opportunity, drug dependency and a iety of other associated complex social issues and harms. Where is Shetland’s voluntary sector represented on SCT  It ain’t, and it runs scared of complaining.These unguarded funds have weakened and distracted local politics in Shetland.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Saturday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27489  ","story":" Michael McMonagleThirty years ago today the British government, fearful of the growth of Sinn Féin, introduced the broadcasting ban to stop Sinn Féin representatives being heard on television and radio. The ban was introduced by the British governments Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd on October , . The ban was brought in an attempt to halt the growth of Sinn Féin in the north and to prevent a wider audience hearing a republican analysis of the ongoing conflict at the time. It prevented Sinn Féin representatives from appearing on television and radio interviews. When it was first introduced many broadcasters were unsure of how it should be implemented and effectively blocked all republicans from the broadcast media, even those who were not members of Sinn Féin. Broadcasters and journalists unions disliked the ban because of the disruption it caused and some sought ways to get around it, the most well known being the actors voice compromise where actors were brought in to speak the words of Sinn Féin representatives. This led to the bizarre situation where viewers could see Sinn Féin representatives on their screens but could not hear their voices. Several actors who went on to have successful stage and screen careers started out by providing the voices for Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and others. Of course, this was not the first time Sinn Féin representatives had been banned from the airwaves the Irish government used a similar tactic  years earlier. Section  of the Broadcasting Act, introduced in , banned Sinn Féin representatives from the media. RTÉ went further and extended the ban to all expressions of republican opinion, including popular ballads. As the peace process progressed the ban appeared more and more ludicrous, forcing the British government to abandon it in . Following the lting of the ban, Raymond McCartney became the first Sinn Féin representative to have his own voice heard in a  television interview. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1093314.jpg--.jpg?1539853794000\n","title":"is kilrea road sliding away","story":"Concerns have been raised about a section of the Kilrea Road where subsidence has caused the footpath to crack. TUV Councillor Timothy Gaston was contacted by local residents about the problem as they feared the footpath and road were not structurally safe.Councillor Gaston fears that the problem is now getting worse and is urging the Roads Department to act. Speaking to the , Councillor Gaston said: “I was contacted by local residents bout the footpath, and as the time has gone on, the problem has just got worse. “I got in contact with the Roads Department and they have been carrying out work to find the source of the problem.“The issue has now been flagged to the structural department from the maintenance department, and tests were carried out on the footpath and road just last week.” The heart of the problem lies with a tree that is growing through a wall at the edge of the footpath. However, there is also some natural subsidence that also needs to be addressed.Councillor Gaston wishes to give some reassurance to the public about the current safety of the footpath and boundary wall.He said: “The Department have said the wall is in no immediate danger of collapsing, but obviously there is a danger of this in the future, so I am eagerly and actively pushing that a solution be reached, before the problem gets any worse.” Many residents have expressed a fear thatthe situation persists, the road may have to be closed indefinitely, which is something Councillor Gaston is also keen to avoid. “There is a fear that part of the road might actually come away, so I am urging officials to act quickly to get a plan in place and be proactive about a solution so as work can be carried out in a controlled way, and the road will only have to be closed for necessary work, not indefinitely.”No plan for the road has been made to date, however officials are currently assessing the wall, footpath and road, and work on devising a plan is underway.

Frank’s story is one of a number which has been put together for the release of a tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends of Thomas and Gerard which is to be launched this weekend in Sailortown.Frank, who is now -years-old worked for Casey’s for over twenty years, recalls that day when fate determined who was in the yard that morning when the gunmen arrived.“My main job in Casey’s was to drive the old Bedford TK lorry, making deliveries to pubs, clubs and off licences. I always had one of the young lads on board as a helper,” explained Frank.“Every Wednesday for thirteen years I delivered to Casey’s off licences in Derry and Coleraine. They would ring in their orders on Monday. We would load up the old reliable Bedford on Tuesday and drive up to them on Wednesday morning.“On the day of the shooting that routine was changed which was fortunate for me and whoever was to go with me in the lorry that day. “The off licence in Derry, was due to be sold that Wednesday. If the sale went through, it meant that we would not be delivering to Derry, only Coleraine.It wasn’t until mid-afternoon that word came through that the sale went ahead. Frances Donnelly asked meI wanted to go on up to Coleraine that afternoon. As it was getting a bit late, I knew that we would not get back to the yard until after seven, so I told her that Thursday would be better. Frances gave me a choice that day and the choice that I made, saved my le.“On the Thursday morning we done a bit of tidying up around the yard and got ready to leave with the drink order.I didn’t know who was coming with me, it could have been any of the three lads, Thomas, another lad called Paul McDonald, and of course Gerard .“The owner, Sam Casey needed some pallets fixed, so that meant that Thomas was not going to go with me, because he was the best man for repairing pallets. That left two of lads to pick from, Paul and Gerard.“For some reason none of them wanted to go out that day and to settle matters Paul tossed a coin to see who had first choice, Gerard won the toss and he chose to stay in the yard. “It wasn’t really a big deal for Paul, he went into the store, got his jacket and that was us, we got into the lorry and left the yard, heading for Coleraine.”Frank and Paul headed off for Coleraine but little did they know what was to happen back in Belfast.“We found out later that we had only left the yard shortly before the gunmen arrived. For me, it was just another normal day. We were oblivious to the fact that while we were happily cruising along the motorway that gunmen had slaughtered our work colleagues and friends, back in Casey’s.“About an hour and a half after leaving Belfast I went into the off licence to speak to the manager. I took a phone call – ‘Frank, they are all dead’. I didn’t catch on what he meant, but it soon became clear and he asked who was with me. I told him that Paul was with me. “That confirmed to Vincent  that it was Thomas and Gerard who had been shot. Vincent was married to Marie, one of Sam Casey’s daughters, who worked in the upstairs office along with her sister Frances. Vincent happened to go in to the yard, unaware of what had happened, he saw one of his workers lying dead and when he went upstairs to the office he was met with an absolute blood bath. His we and her sister had been brutally murdered. “I drove back to Belfast in the lorry along with Paul, but I have absolutely no memory of the journey or the conversation between us, but I do remember going to the yard and getting the gates opened so I could drive the lorry in. “When I got into the yard there was blood everywhere, even on the fork lt. There was no one about, but I had no sooner got the lorry parked up, when newspaper reporters started to arrive outside, looking for interviews.“Thomas was seriously wounded and after treatment in hospital, was released after about two weeks. I know that Sam Casey was elated at the fact that Thomas had survived and was on the mend. Sam’s elation soon turned to deep sadness, Thomas died from his wounds exactly three weeks after he was shot.“The gunmen who went into the yard that day and shot my friends down like dogs have to bear the absolute responsibility, but fate played a role, as to who was in the yard when the murderers arrived.“The destiny of at least nine people was decided that day. The survival of the workers who would normally have been in the yard every single Thursday and the slaughter of those who happened to be there, was a matter of “s and buts” and for Gerard it was the outcome of a simple toss of a coin. “Yes, the outcome of the toss of a coin sealed Gerard’s fate, but saved the le of another worker. For Thomas, it was his skills at repairing wooden pallets that meant that he was working in the yard that morning.“I also think of the salesman who had been in the yard on business that morning and left just as we were driving out the gate. “Sam Casey, whose two daughters were murdered, would also have been in the yard that morning had he not have been in the Mater Hospital where he was recovering from a minor operation.”The tribute book will be launched this Sundayin the Mission to Seafarers Centre in Sailortown, soon after a plaque unveiling at pm at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailortown tribute","story":"A TRIBUTE afternoon is to take place in Sailortown this weekend to remember two men who died in a UVF sectarian shooting,  years ago.Gerard ‘Coke’ Grogan,  and Thomas ‘Tucker’ Osborne,  were killed in the shooting at their workplace, Casey’s Bottling Plant in Millfield on October , . Marie McGrattanand Frances Donnelly , daughters of the owner Sam Casey, were also murdered in the incident.On Sunday afternoon, a commemorative plaque will be erected at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown at pm in memory of Gerard and Thomas who grew up in the area.A tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends will then be launched in the Mission to Seafarers Centre.The book, entitled ‘Ifs and Buts and the Toss of a Coin’ is a collection of humble and human stories about Thomas and Gerard as told by their friends and heartbroken family members.Brian Quinn, who has helped organised the event with the Docksiders Senior Men’s Group and friends of Thomas and Gerard, is hoping Sunday will be a fitting tribute.“It will be a nice day. We are pleased that  years after their brutal murders they will be publicly recognised in a respectful way.“Thomas and Gerard’s friends were all around the same age, lived a few streets apart, schooled together, worked together and in a special childhood bond, both were baptised in St Joseph’s Church.“We never got the chance to grow old with Thomas and Gerard. The least we can do now is to pay proper respect and where better to site the tribute than St Joseph’s in Sailortown.”The book also includes a tribute story to StephenBegley who is widely regarded as the fth victim of the Casey’s atrocity. On the day Gerard was laid to rest, his friend Mitch decided to hop on the back of a lorry after the funeral which was heading back into town. As the lorry approached Millfield, Mitch lost his balance and fell from the lorry and was killed.The public are asked to assemble at St Joseph’s Church on Princes Dock Street on Sundayat pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"two hundred jobs created at springfield factory in two years","story":"THE Innovation Factory in West Belfast is celebrating the creation of more than  jobs on its second anniversary.The business hub on the Springfield Road opened in October  with the aim of encouraging entrepren-eurship, innovation, and helping new high-tech businesses to grow.The  businesses located at Innovation Factory are some of the most ground-breaking, innovative companies in the north dealing in areas such as G technology, software development, film production and digital applications.Majella Barkley, Innovation Director, said: “The key to the success of Innovation Factory has been flexibility and support modern businesses need to be able to change and adapt their environment rapidly.

NI-Scotland bridge definitely can be done, says leading UK architect  Bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland could create Celtic powerhouseThe DUPs transport spokesperson wrote about the plan in the latest issue of The House, the parliamentary magazine. Former DUP Health Minister Simon Hamilton previously backed the plan in an article for The Belfast .Boris Johnson, a former UK Foreign Secretary said the plan should be seriously considered by the UK government.Alan Dunlop, an academic from Liverpool University suggested the bridge could be between Larne and the village of Portpatrick in south west Scotland, or between Torr Head on the Antrim Coast and the Mull of Kintyre.The cost of the project has been estimated at £ billion.In his article Mr Girvan pointed out that the idea of connecting the two countries was discussed as far back as the s when a tunnel was discussed. He said that his party did not \"pretend to know all the answers\" but that a feasibility study would help find out the realities of building the bridge.\"Across the world, bridges and tunnels have been constructed which only a decade or two earlier would have been ruled impossible or impractical. Technology moves on and we in the United Kingdom should not self-censor ambition,\" the South Antrim MP wrote. Paul GirvanMr Girvan said that similar projects like the Oresund bridge linking Denmark and Sweden showed the potential benefits of such a project.He also admitted that as a unionist \"there will always be an attraction in seeing a physical connection between Northern Ireland and Great Britain\".\"It is not without signicance, either, that the Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney welcomed the idea of investigating the feasibility of such a scheme. Those making the crossing would not just come from Northern Ireland it would also be an important connection between the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain,\" Mr Girvan wrote.\"There are many ambitious projects that we can look back on today and admire the foresight of those who saw a vision become reality. None of them would have happenedthe initial proposals were rejected without even receiving proper consideration.\"As we leave the European Union, the DUP has been clear that there should be no border erected down the Irish Sea.

She was very clear she accepts the uncertainty that it’s causing at the minute and the impact that could be having.“But she was making it clear to everybody that she does believe a deal can be done and she is confident.“The only sticking point is the Northern Ireland border and the backstop arrangements.”Downing Street said Mrs May told the business leaders that “signicant progress” has been made in the talks.“She acknowledged that there were a few signicant issues that were still outstanding, but said that the very real sense she had from leaders around the table at the council was that they wanted to reach a deal as soon as possible this autumn,” a No  spokesman said.“She emphasised that both sides wanted to have our future relationship in place by the end of December  so that the backstop never needed to be used, but that the negotiating teams would work intensively on this to find a way forward.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa May also met with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar while in Brussels, to discuss the Irish border issue Japanese car firms warned that failing to reach a Brexit deal must be “avoided at all costs”.Akio Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said: “If no withdrawal agreement is reached and the transition period through December  is consequently not implemented, corporate activities and consumers will be adversely affected by the impacts of suspended production activities resulting from failed just-in-time logistics operations, declines in revenue, and revised vehicle sales prices caused by spiralling logistics and production costs.“We hope that both the UK and EU governments will continue to make maximum efforts to reach a satisfactory settlement and that a “withdrawal without agreement” is avoided at all costs.”It comes after Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged warring Tories to get behind Mrs May’s Brexit strategy following the backlash over the possibility of extending the transition period.Meanwhile, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned that the UK’s withdrawal agreement could still fail over the issue of the Irish border, leading to an “extremely serious” no-deal Brexit.Speaking to France-Inter radio, Mr Barnier said the deal was “%” done and he was hoping to complete it “in a few weeks or a few months, as soon as possible”.But askedhe was convinced an agreement would be reached, he replied: “I have no deep conviction on this subject, because in the UK the political situation is very complex and I don’t know what decisions Theresa May will take.”Askedthe whole deal could founder over the border issue, he replied: “My answer is yes.”Mr Barnier said that he believed the Brexit vote was fuelled in part by “nostalgia” as well as popular anger over the impact of globalisation, but said he had yet to find anyone who could explain how it would provide any answers to voters’ anxieties.The firestorm around Mrs May came as she signalled she is ready to delay the UK’s final departure from the EU’s hold until  in a last ditch bid to end the deadlock over the Irish border issue.Britain has secured a -month transition period following the formal date of Brexit in March , to give authorities and companies time to prepare for new arrangements.But EU chiefs have indicated this could be extended at the European Council summit this week in Brussels.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Conservative MP Johnny Mercer has been highly critical of Prime Minister Theresa May Speaking to BBC Radio ’s Today programme, Mr Hunt said: “The reason why this week has been dficult is because Theresa May has not buckled.“She has held firm. She has stuck to her principles.“It is precisely because she has not capitulated that we have not concluded this agreement.“The one thing I would say to my colleagues is that the great strength of the EU in these negotiations is that the  EU nations have remained united.“We now need to do the same behind Theresa May to maximise her negotiating leverage in Brussels and make sure she does come back with that deal that honours the letter and spirit of the referendum decision.”One of the most robust critics was vocal Tory backbencher and former soldier Johnny Mercer, who used an interview with The House magazine to open fire on the leadership.Calling it a “shit show” he warned thatTory internecine rows over Brexit let in Jeremy Corbyn “I don’t think we’d be forgiven for a generation and we wouldn’t deserve to be”.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group, poured scorn on Mr Hunt’s claim the Prime Minister was standing firm in the face of EU demands.“Are you really telling me standing firm on the integrity of the United Kingdom is a really brave thing for the British Government to do  You would have thought this was to be taken as read,” he told the Today programme.“Surely no government would ever go into a negotiation and agree to carve up the country for the sake of an international organisation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar brexit extension not an alternative to legally binding irish backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

We have been able to negotiate changes and on foot of them we had a second referendum in the past but I do recall Irish people and me personally taking offence at foreign leaders coming over to intervene on our referendums so I would never repeat that mistake.”We shouldn’t forget this isn’t just a case of getting a deal that Westminster can accept it also has to be accepted by the European Parliament as wellTaoiseach Leo VaradkarFacebookTwitterHe also described the internal politics of the British Government as “dficult”, adding that Prime Minister Theresa May is running a minority government with internal isions.AskedMrs May was going to have to drop the support of the Democratic Unionists in order to push through a Brexit deal, Mr Varadkar said it was “her judgment call”.“Even the opposition in the UK is ided on theseissues so that’s a judgment call she is going to have to make.“As I pointed out yesterday, we shouldn’t forget this isn’t just a case of getting a deal that Westminster can accept it also has to be accepted by the European Parliament as well.“And the European Parliament has been very strong in supporting Ireland and our need to have a backstop to avoid a hard border and, particularly when it comes to citizens’ rights, the European Parliament has been a very strong ally too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures one year on harry and meghan back at invictus games","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

The newly-formed Ballynahinch United played in a local summer league which involved teams such as Montalto, Drumaness Mills, Plessey, Saintfield, Magheradroll and another called the Bachelors, who apparently had an Italian playing for them.The club made their competitive debut in Division  of the Newcastle and District League in September  when they travelled to Ballykinlar Army Camp to take on the Light Infantry.This fixture would prove to be quite an ordeal in many ways with the team being beaten - as player and car owner Ted McKibbin had to make double journeys to ferry players to and from Ballykinlar.Not a single league victory was recorded that season, although they won a number of friendly games.Although the   season started more optimistically with a - draw away to Down Olympic, it was a further seven games until they defeated the RAF at Bishopscourt -. During the summer of  the team won all eight games to win the Kilmore and District Summer League.Things improved signicantly in the   season as they were promoted as runners-up in Division  and also won the Enterprise Cup, which was played on a league basis, beating Saintfield AYC ndash in the replay after a - draw in the first match.The Swts were formed for the   season and they played in the Willowfield League recording their first win against Saintfield United on October , .Having been promoted to Division  of the Newcastle  District League, they won it at the first attempt and with the Swts moving to the Newcastle League for the   season, both teams performed a unique double by winning Divisions  and  while United reached and lost the Harry Clarke Cup final.United went to the Northern Amateur Football League for the   season and were promoted from Division B and they also reached the Irish Junior Cup only to lose to Moyola Park. They won the Division A title in  In the   season they lost the Irish Junior Cup final to st Bangor Old Boys while the Swts were probably the first reserve team to reach the Harry Clarke Cup Final which they lost after a replay to Downshire Hospital.Consecutive Cochrane Corry Cup finals were lost in   and  , as well as a second County Antrim Junior Shield final in .Manager Billy Hamilton, who had guided the team through the s so successfully, stood down at the end of the   season and then went on to become secretary of the County Antrim Football Association for a number of years. The playing strength within the club led to the formation of the Albion, in .In the mid s Ballynahinch Recreation folded. United took over the Millbridge playing fields and undertook signicant development work which led to it being admitted to Division C of the Northern Amateur Football League.Under the management of Bobbie Reid, they played their first games at intermediate level in the   season while the Swts switched to the NAFL reserve section, However the Albion remained in the Newcastle League.Success came quickly when Brian McKibbenrsquos team won the Border Regiment Cup in the   season after extra-time and penalties. Brian stood down as manager in  and through the efforts of Gerry McCormick and Cyril Lennon mid-table league positions were achieved.Under the leadership of club chairman Campbell Allen, great strides were being made with improvements to the drainage of the pitch, erection of tubular steel fencing around the pitch, construction of new dugouts and the erection of floodlighting to the training pitch with the clubhouse being substantially refurbished.For the   season Noel Dean was recruited as manager and he steered the team to their first and only promotion at intermediate level when they moved from Division B to A as runners-up to Dromara Village.The following season a mid-table position was achieved together with a memorable midweek Irish Cup replay defeat of Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge.Dean stepped down during the season and he was replaced by Michael Savage, who led the team to the final of the Clarence Cup which they were awarded as a result of Knockbreda Parish fielding an ineligible player.That same season the Swts, under manager Geoffrey Smith, lost the Purdy Cup final while Davy Teggartyrsquos Albion won the Bignian Cup and were also promoted to Division  as runners-up. Sadly, this team broke up and there followed a decade of struggle during which managers Eamon Wilson, Norman McCullough, Davy Teggarty and Alan Brown worked tirelessly to halt the downward trend.The occasional bit of encouragement came along with the Albion reaching two successive Shimna Cup finals in   and   only to lose out in penalty shoot-outs while in   the Albion won the Donard Dairy Shield defeating Castlewellan IIIs ndash.Campbell Allen stepped down due to business commitments and the current chairman Gilbert Cromie took over.In May  the club were awarded the honour of hosting the Britton Rosebowl International between the NAFL and the Scottish Amateur League at Millbridge.Nigel Neale managed the team for the   season, but resigned with ten matches remaining. Experienced first teamer Alan Stevens took over, assisted by John Jones, and they led the team to one of their highest finishes in years.Former manager Cyril Lennon came in for the   season and United enjoyed their highest league position for years. Stuart Buchanan came in as manager of the Swts and led them to the Newcastle  District League Division A title.The following season United again narrowly missed out on promotion, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Intermediate Cup when they were defeated by Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge. The Swts re-entered the Northern Amateur League and were promoted as runners-up in Division E to Bangor Rangers.Much to everyonersquos disappointment, Cyril Lennon stepped down and Steven Bell took over along with John Jones and they led the team to a very respectable fourth place in Division B. United were awarded the North East Referees Association Merit Award for Fair Play at the AGM of the NAFL.The Swts continued their good form to finish runners-up to Downpatrick IIs in NAFL D, but manager Stuart Buchanan stepped down due to study commitments.In the summer of  the club celebrated its th anniversary which a special former playersrsquo night and a friendly match against Irish Premier League side Lisburn Distillery. The Albion managed by Johnny Reid won Division  of the Newcastle  District League.In   the club was awarded a % grant from the IFA to undertake an upgrading of its facilities to meet new Intermediate regulations.Steven Bell stood down in January . A new management team of Colin Murray and John Jones took over the role and they guided the first team to a fourth place finish on goal dference. Much to the clubrsquos disappointment the Albion had to be withdrawn from the Newcastle League due to a reduction in the clubrsquos player pool.In the   season the club embarked on its usual Irish Cup campaign little knowing that it would reach the fth round for the first time and be drawn against Premier Division side Coleraine. This brought about a wonderful adventure during which the club was able to garner a massive support which necessitated the ordering of two double decker buses for supporters as well as a bus for the team.Everything was done as professionally as possible and despite a heavy defeat, although the score was - at half time, the players and their management gained enormous respect.In more recent times the team has been managed by Keith Hamilton, Scott Brashaw and Ross Hayes as caretaker managers, Alan Davis and Paul Allison. In the current season, former player Glynn Robinson and Dale Davidson have taken on the role and have made a promising start with good results in both league and cup competition.Over the last  years the club has been involved in a number of proposed amalgamation initiatives involving Ballynahinch Recreation, Ballynahinch Olympic and Temple Rangers, but none materialised.One amalgamation that did happen was with Ballynahinch Youth Football Club, which now means that the club includes male and female from age six years forward and a ladiesrsquo senior team. This fits in superbly with the clubrsquos ethos of being inclusive to all within the local community which has been something that is reflected in its history from day one.It also brought to the club an outstanding group of coaches and administrators which has invigorated the club.No club could everwithout committed iniduals being involved in its organisation and the club has had a cadre of them over five decades.The passing of the clubrsquos elder statesman, Billy Hamilton senior, in December  brought to an end outstanding service not only within the club as a player and administrator, but also within the leagues and governing bodies.Billy was no stranger to working hard on the ground, putting up nets and marking the pitch both at Feersquos Field in Dromara and Millbridge, aided and abetted by club president Winston Brown, who works away in the background and has done so for  years.Jimmy Brown has toiled tirelessly and selflessly for well over  years, keeping Millbridge well-manicured as well as using his building, plumbing and plastering skills to maximum effect.In addition to Billy senior, the Hamilton family have made an outstanding contribution with Billy junior managing for over a decade. Graham scored hundreds of goals over those early years while Wilson mdash better known to all as Chico mdash played for all three teams and continues to serve as a committee member to the present day.We can never forget the contribution that Sally Hamilton has made as she continues to attend the home matches and has made the sandwiches served to visiting teams at the Millbridge for decades. In addition to managing the team and being involved administratively with the club, Bobbie Reid has served as the clubrsquos Newcastle League representative for many years. Last, but not least, there is Davy Teggarty, who has fulfilled every role possible.While all of these iniduals and others have helped over the years we are most fortunate to have a new generation who have stepped forward and will see the club move forward for which we are extremely thankful..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Peace lantern walk marking WWI end 100th anniversary  ","story":"A UNIQUE peace lantern walk is to be held in Killyleagh to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.The lantern will be carried in a relay chain from Shrigley to Killyleagh, and through its main streets, before a flame from it is used to light a gas beacon at the front of Killyleagh Castle on Remembrance night.A Killyleagh veteran, who is one of Northern Irelandrsquos last RAF survivors from the Second World War, has been given the honour of carrying the lantern on the final relay before the Beacon of Light is lit.Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who is aged  and who survived more than  bombing missions as a rear gunner in Halax and Lancaster bombers in the Second World War, will light the beacon to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent in  after four years of the world at war.The Bomber Command veteran who still walks up to six miles a day and is one of Killyleaghrsquos most instantly recognisable residents, will be joined in the final relay of the cross-community walk by local schoolchildren and  unsung heroes from the local community.The Killyleagh Beacon of Light will be among the first of around  bonfires and beacons to be lit across Northern Ireland at pm at the end of Remembrance Sunday, as part of the Battlersquos Over commemorations on Sunday, November .Chris Hagan, the chairman of the Killyleagh Remembers the Great War project, revealed that an original candle and lantern, used on the th anniversary of the start of the war, will be used as part of a chain to light the beacon.ldquoWe extinguished a candle lantern in August  to mark  years from the beginning of the war, he said. ldquoIn remembrance of the end of the war and the millions who were killed or came home dreadfully wounded, the lantern will be lit again.ldquoThere were two bonfires lit in Killyleagh on the night the war ended at the Castle Square and at the Cross.

Armagh were largely at full strength with influential number  Neil Faloon passed fit.Armagh took an early lead with a penalty from promising young out-half Cormac Fox.The game then became entrenched around the halfway line with both sides either unwilling or unable to put any width on the ball due to the conditions.Armagh edged the possession and territory, but with defences well drilled on both sides it looked like only a mistake would provide any try-scoring opportunity on either side.There were a few fumbles from speculative kicks on both sides but defences were able to scramble into place and snuff out any chances relatively comfortably to leave the half-time score at -.The second half brought more of the same. Ballynahinch had to withstand a period of sustained Armagh possession, but did so without any major alarms.However, they were unable to stamp any real authority of their own on proceedings and as the match drted into its later stages it seemed that Armagh had done enough to escape with a famous win.Former Armagh man Richard Reaney had other ideas and he converted a penalty in the final minute to earn the home side a draw.Armagh will be happier with the result, but the Ballynahinch players and coaches will take the two points and move on to the tricky trip to Old Belvedere next week.The final round of the Celtic Cup took place last weekend, freeing up Ulster squad members for club rugby, but it remains to be seen how soon they become available. The depth of the club squad will continue to be tested over the coming weeks.Ballynahinch City of Armagh ALL-IRELAND LEAGUE DIVISON B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Red Bull Racing bringing Formula 1 car to City of Merchants Festival  ","story":"A TOP Formula  racing team is coming to Newry as part of the forthcoming City of Merchants Festival.Aston Martin Red Bull Racing will be bringing one of its famous F cars to Marcus Square on Sunday, November , between pm and pm.The eagerly awaited visit has been organised by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with First Derivatives and Newry Business Improvement District.Council chairman Mark Murnin said: ldquoThis is a great high-octane addition to an already action-packed City of Merchants weekend.ldquoUnleashing the spectacle of F for fans across the district is fantastic, and we are thrilled that Newry is one of its pit stop destinations during its travels around Northern Ireland.Louise Cunningham, Vice-President of Marketing at First Derivatives said: ldquoWe are delighted to welcome Aston Martin Red Bull Racing to our hometown of Newry.Over the last year, we have been building upon our partnership and supporting the team with data analysis for off track projects helping the development of its  cars.

A number of parked cars have also been damaged.It is being reported that some shops have closed early to protect staff, while residents who live near the historic Grove area in the shadow of Down Cathedral have revealed they have been verbally abused.Representatives from residentsrsquo groups in Stream Street, Bridge Street, Russell Park and Lynn Doyle Place have been invited to attend the meeting which they hope will result in an action plan being devised to tackle a problem caused by what some have described as ldquoferal youths.Grove Shopping Centre caretaker Peter Smyth, said businesses were frustrated that nothing is being done to address the problems and wanted local police to do more.ldquoBusinesses have had to pull down shutters either temporarily or shut early to protect staff in the St Patrickrsquos Square area, he said.ldquoWhile the trouble is largely centred on area between the Grove, the Saint Patrick Centre and the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, it radiates out to town centre neighbourhoods and last week a number of young people climbed on to the roof at the nearby bus station.Anthony Trainor, of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, said local people, including those who work in the town centre, have had their cars deliberately damaged.ldquoResidentsrsquo groups are telling us that there have been assaults on adults and children.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The idea that it was [Treasury funding] almost seemed to people to remove the risk – but we are in charge of public money”.Mr Woods was also scathing about how members of DETI’s energy ision reacted to his enquiries.Two civil servants – Stuart Wightman and Seamus Hughes – did not provide him with a copy of a ‘handover note’ which had been given to them when they joined energy ision and which signicantly undermined the story which they were telling him at that point.Mr Woods said it was “one of the lowest levels of cooperation I’ve experienced” and led to the department beginning an investigation ahead of potential disciplinary proceedings, a process which has been put on hold while the public inquiry is ongoing.Ex police chief: The peace process has ‘destroyed’ prospects of justice for Troubles victims Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

We have today written history.ldquoWe have sent the most complex stack of spacecraft that ever have been conceived into space, and to a very long journey to an environment which is truly out of the Earth truly out of this world.The Mercury Transfer Module , carrying the orbiters, was built in Stevenage by the Defence and Space ision of aerospace company Airbus.Key elements of ESAs Mercury Planet Orbiter were also assembled by Airbus in the UK.Scientists hope the pound. billion mission will unravel some of Mercuryrsquos many mysteries, such as the reason for its oversized iron core, its spectacular volcanic vents, and tantalising hints of water ice in shadowy parts of the scorching hot planet.The answers they get will shed new light on the origins and evolution of the solar system.A key feature of BepiColombo is that it is the first interplanetary mission to employ advanced electric ion propulsion technology.Four Star Trek-style ldquoimpulse engines, two firing at a time, will emit beams of electrically charged, or ldquoionised, xenon gas.After years of planning, training and simulations, here is the moment that #BepiColombo## left Earth#on its mission to explore #Mercury#https:t.co jpXUiQRgUl pic nzStdPcmdash ESA OperationsOctober , They will be used not to accelerate the craft but to act as a brake against the sunrsquos enormous gravity.A series of fly-bys past the Earth, Venus, and Mercury will also help to reduce BepiColomborsquos velocity by km per second.At top speed after launch, the spacecraft will be moving at kmper second.One of the biggest challenges for mission planners was ensuring the spacecraft could withstand searing temperatures of more than C so close to the sun.Protective measures include a heat shield, novel ceramic and titanium insulation, ammonia-filled ldquoheat pipes, and in the case of the Japanese orbiter, ldquoroast-on-a-spit spinning.A suite of  instruments on the MPO will map the surface of Mercury and probe its chemical composition for up to two years.FIRST SIGNAL RECEIVED# from #BepiColombo##, detected by @ESAs antenna at #NewNorcia, Australia#.With these first words#, engineers at #ESOC# can monitor the status  execution of the autonomous activities onboard the spacecraft pic JkYppgAOCmdash ESA OperationsOctober , Meanwhile, the Japanese space agency Jaxarsquos Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiterrsquos five instruments will focus on the planetrsquos unusual lopsided magnetic field.One of BepiColomborsquos main instruments, the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer , was designed and built at the University of Leicester.The ion thrusters were supplied by the UK defence technology company QinetiQ.Only two spacecraft have previously visited Mercury. Nasarsquos Mariner  flew past the planet three times in - and the American space agencyrsquos Messenger probe orbited Mercury from  to .BepiColombo was named after the late Giuseppe ldquoBepi Colombo, an Italian scientist and engineer who played a leading role in the  Mariner  mission.The BepiColumbo spacecraft is due to arrive at Mercury in seven years Professor Emma Bunce, from the University of Leicester, who heads the Mixs instrument team, said after watching the launch: ldquoI didnrsquot know what to expect but it was absolutely amazing, just spectacular, the way it lit up the whole sky and the way the sound eventually reaches you. Quite emotional really.ldquoYou think about the instrument yoursquove worked for so many years on sitting on top of that rocket and you hope itrsquos going to be OK.Justin Byrne, head of science at Airbus Defence and Space, said: ldquoMy feelings are of relief. Wersquove spent  years building a complex spacecraft so itrsquos fantastic that itrsquos going on its journey. Irsquom excited about whatrsquos to come.ldquoThe engines will be switched on in a few days and that will be the crowning glory. Then we have seven years to wait for the science.ESA director general Professor Jan Woerner sounded a word of caution, pointing out that the launch was only the ldquofirst step.He added: ldquoOf course Irsquom happy that the launch worked perfectly. Now we have to see what happens in the future, but I am optimistic.Around  minutes after the launch came confirmation that BepiColombo had separated from the last stage of the Ariane  rocket.Then came the news that the  metre wide solar  had deployed successfully, which was a critical early point of the mission..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: British-built spacecraft heads for planet Mercury article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank.

It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later.

He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
