A vintage sepia gelatin silver print photograph is expected to fetch up to £6,000 at auction on April 11 The girls borrowed Elsie\u0027s father\u0027s Midg quarter-plate camera and used coloured paper cut-outs and hit pins to stage the scenes near the stream in Elsie\u0027s garden.  While Elsie\u0027s father, a keen amateur photographer who developed the prints, never doubted they were fakes, his wife Polly was a believer. In 1919 she took prints of the two photographs to show members of the Theosophical Society in Bradford where they were giving a lecture on fairy life.During 1920 Conan Doyle, a committed and leading spiritualist believer, became aware of the photographs and wanted to use them for an article on fairies for The Strand Magazine.In the summer of 1920, after their initial success three years earlier, the youngsters managed to \u0027capture\u0027 three more images of themselves with fairies.

A customs union was a leading contender in the first round last week - but was still defeated by a majorityAmid claims he would resign if Mrs May ignored Parliament and switched to No Deal, Mr Gauke added: \u0027I just don\u0027t think the British people would thank us if we left without a deal and we said we were just following the referendum result.\u0027 Mr Gauke\u0027s intervention comes amid claims Mrs May faces mass resignations from her Cabinet whichever course she takes.        Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Business Secretary Greg Clark are all urging Mrs May to accept a customs union – with the implicit threat that they will resign if she does not.But Cabinet Brexiteers, orchestrated by Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom, are implacably opposed and are likely to quit if Mrs May starts to negotiate membership of a customs union with the EU. The pressure has been ramped up by the letter sent by 170 Brexit-supporting Conservatives demanding the UK leaves the EU on April 12 ‘with or without a deal’. There are reports the letter was signed by Cabinet Ministers including Andrea Laadsom, Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove. There are just days to resolve the impasse with No Deal currently due on April 12. A long extension to Brexit could be agreed by the EU at an emergency summit on April 10 -  but it will only happen if Britain agrees to hold EU elections and has a clear plan.          Jeremy Corbyn would be poised on the threshold of Downing Street if Theresa May (pictured today at church in Maidenhead) called a General Election, a Mail on Sunday poll found         Although Mr Corbyn would be 19 seats short of a majority, it would leave him in pole position to enter No 10 if he could strike an deal with the Scottish NationalistsAs Tories acknowledged they were preparing for the possibility of a general election, a poll gave Labour a five point lead. If repeated at an election, Labour would be on course to win 307 seats, while the Conservatives would claim just 264.Although Mr Corbyn would be 19 seats short of a majority, it would leave him in pole position to enter No 10 if he could strike an deal with the Scottish Nationalists.When the 11-strong Independent Group of Labour and Tory MPs is included in the poll choices, Labour is still ahead, on 35 per cent, with the Tories on 32 per cent and the new group – now called Change UK – on nine per cent.But one Labour MP told MailOnline that talk of an election was \u0027going down like a bucket of cold sick\u0027 on both sides of the house.The MP said only a handful of Labour MPs close to the leader welcomed a general election.              Former Brexit Secretaries Boris Johnson, left, and Dominic Raab, right, are contenders for the Premiership when Theresa May stands down         Jeremy Corbyn would be poised on the threshold of Downing Street if Theresa May called a General Election, an exclusive Mail on Sunday poll has foundTory leadership hopefuls are also jockeying ever more publicly to replace Mrs May, who announced her intention last week to step down once this phase of Brexit is complete.Boris Johnson, sporting a tidier haircut and significant weight loss, called on the PM to quit this week after she lost another meaningful vote and his fellow former Brexit Secretary Dominc Raab today hit back at \u0027smears\u0027 claiming he had bullied officials.Liz Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury, set out her stall for the top job with an interview in which she called for Tories to use the \u0027vast majority\u0027 of a £27bn Brexit war chest to \u0027slash taxes\u0027.A Mail on Sunday poll shows Boris enjoys a clear lead among the electorate in the race to succeed Mrs May as Tory leader, with more than twice the level of support of his closest rival, Home Secretary Sajid Javid. Environment Secretary Michael Gove is the next most popular, followed by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab, and Liz Truss.But Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis has told friends that if Mrs May survives the coming weeks, then Downing Street hopes to delay the final stages of the contest until the gathering in Manchester – in the hope it will deprive Mr Johnson of an immediate ‘Brexit bounce’ if Britain has left the EU.Allies of Mrs May believe that a long contest would offer the best chance for the leadership to skip a generation, allowing a ‘dark horse’ candidate such as Tom Tugendhat, James Cleverly or Mark Harper to surge through the ranks.       The shadow foreign Secretary accused Theresa May of being \u0027out of control\u0027, warning the \u0027time may come\u0027 when Labour makes a second attempt to force a general election. Emily Thornberry said the Prime Minister was \u0027not listening\u0027 to Parliament after reports she is planning to bring her vote back to the Commons yet again, despite its third rout on Friday.Ms Thorberry said: \u0027Even with just days to go she is just saying \u0027It is my deal or no deal\u0027. That is not meaningful, that is not democracy.\u0027That is Theresa May stamping her feet and saying \u0027I want this, no one else is allowed to do anything.\u0027No wonder she is in trouble. She is out of control. She is not listening to anyone. No one knows what it is that she is going to do next.\u0027I think her judgment has been undermined.\u0027Labour called and lost a motion of no confidence in the Government in January but could make a second attempt in days. Losing would start a two-week countdown to a General Election unless an alternative government could be formed.But Labour and Opposition MPs can only win a vote if some Conservative MPs switch sides and vote against their own party. Some Brexiteer Tories have hinted they could do so to block the deal, while Remain Tories have warned they might to avoid No Deal.       Ex-PM Sir John Major said this morning the situation should be taken over by a national government to resolve the crisis. He told Andrew Marr: \u0027We may be driven to a national government.\u0027Sir John added that \u0027whomsoever is Prime Minister\u0027 would invite figures in from other parties to form a \u0027time-limited unity Government\u0027. Outlining how to approach the Brexit issues, Sir John told BBC1\u0027s The Andrew Marr Show: \u0027If we have a general election in the autumn, which I think is possible not certain, and we don\u0027t get a government with a clear majority then I think it would be in the national interest to have a cross-party government so that we can take decisions without the chaos that we\u0027re seeing in Parliament at the moment where every possible alternative is rejected.\u0027Asked for his advice to Mrs May about whether or not she should call an election this week, Sir John replied: \u0027Don\u0027t. I mean don\u0027t for a whole range of reasons.\u0027The Prime Minister is blocked in on every side, I utterly can empathise with her frustration but I think a general election will solve nothing at this moment.\u0027He advocated a \u0027national leader not a factional leader\u0027.           Ex-Prime Minister Sir John Major (pictured today on the Marr show) warned Mrs May against calling an election to end the impasse and said the country may need a time-limited \u0027national government\u0027 including both Tory and Labour politicians"},{"url":null,"title":"Psychologist investigated links material calling gay people lashed","story":"Share this articlePsychologist to be investigated over opposition to LGBT lessons | Education | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Is Britains pointless footpath","story":"Share this article A photo of the path was posted on the FelixstoweNews Facebook page with the hashtag #pathgate and the question: \u0027When is a path not a path?\u0027Tessa Aston wrote: \u0027Ridiculous!

They had £60,000 of savings — earmarked for that extension that never happened.Their beloved Adamastor, a 42ft Crossbow, which needed ‘a lot of work’, cost £35,000. They reckon they spent most of their £60,000 before they even left England. ‘Just before we set sail, we were haemorrhaging money. Every day brought new things the boat needed. Even at times since, if we’ve had big expenditures — a new mainsail sets you back thousands — we’ve dipped down to the last pennies.’         The Adamastor (pictured at anchor in French Polynesia) is a 42ft Crossbow and needed ‘a lot of work’. But it still cost the couple £35,000They have mortgages on both their London houses, but rental income, too. Extra money (‘only pocket money, really,’ says Jess) comes from her writing for sailing magazines and she also blogs about their adventures.They mostly dock in places that don’t charge for mooring.While some of the world’s larger marinas offer grocery delivery, in remote places they have to pick fruit from trees or barter for goods. ‘If we go inland,’ says Jess, ‘we are more likely to stay in a hostel than a four-star hotel.’         Adventure: James swims with Indigo in Papua New GuineaAs for their children, wherever they go they are fussed over. They have slotted into this lifestyle with remarkable ease.Their boat has two double cabins and a single ‘studio’ that is mostly used as a workshop for repairs. A single table is used for dinner, craft hobbies and work (James, who does all the cooking, finally got round to designing an extension for their London home and submitted the plans from Fiji).Jess says: ‘Everything is safety-first. There are no hard edges. Things are locked down.’ On deck, they have strict rules about lifejackets or harnesses having to be worn and nets are placed around the sides.Of course, they steer clear of parts of the world where there are pirates or political unrest.One of the family’s longest sailing legs was from Mexico to New Zealand, stopping off at many South Pacific islands along the way (they married in Fiji in 2014). The first passage, to the Marquesas, in French Polynesia, took 26 days.Their daughter learned to crawl on the crossing, had her first birthday in Bora Bora and started walking in Tonga. All three of the children are, obviously, home-schooled and follow no curriculum.James says: ‘If Rocket was at school in England, she’d probably be more advanced with her handwriting. But would she know as much about whale sharks?‘They know about the tides, about the moon, about the weather. And we read up on the history of every part of the world we visit.’Do they worry about their children missing out? ‘They can’t join an orchestra or learn things such as karate — but look at what they have done,’ says their dad.Inevitably, their lifestyle means the family are aware of the need to protect the environment.James says: ‘We’ve had to stop the boat because of plastic bags being caught around the propeller. We’ve seen first-hand the impact of pollution.’Jess and James relish the fact that they are with their children — and each other — 24 hours a day. ‘Funnily, we have argued more since we’ve come back to London just for a short time,’ says James. ‘You can physically feel the pressure come back into your life.’Jess says: ‘At home, people drive on motorways at 70mph with their kids in the back.

The charity said the UK must get to grips with its bulging waistline to reduce rates of the illness.Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: ‘One person being diagnosed every three minutes illustrates the frightening speed at which the number of people living with Type 2 diabetes is increasing. However, three in five cases of Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed by eating well, being active and achieving a healthy weight, meaning there is hope for the future.         Diabetes is the UK\u0027s fastest growing health crisis with the number of cases doubling in 20 years to 3.7million         Two-thirds of adults and a third of children are now overweight – and the UK has the third highest obesity rate in Europe       ‘Action must also be taken to tackle the obesity epidemic, which has contributed to the rise of Type 2 diabetes.’He said a further 12.3million are at risk of developing the condition and encouraged people to use the NHS Know Your Risk tool.Diabetes costs the NHS almost £9billion a year and one in six hospital beds at any one time are occupied by someone with the condition.While Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease which occurs if the body stops producing insulin, Type 2 is largely preventable.Type 2 develops because of a fatty build-up around the muscle and liver cells – with nine in ten with this form of disease either overweight or obese.Although both types can be controlled using drugs, it is still regarded as a life-shortening condition because of the damage caused by the build-up of sugar in the blood over time. The charity estimates that unless decisive action is taken, by 2030 more than 5.5million people will be living with diabetes in the UK.Measures including prescribing a low-calorie soup and shake diet to patients to reverse the condition, are being rolled out as part of the NHS Long Term Plan. The scheme puts diabetics on a liquid-only diet of 800 calories a day after trials showed it was successful.Department of Health officials are also considering measures to reduce obesity, including mandatory calorie labelling and bans on promotions on foods that are high in sugar and fat.Food firms and restaurants have also been told to cut their calorie content by a fifth by 2024, by reducing portion sizes or changing the ingredients.Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘Although a prevention plan is now being rolled out, expect the figures to escalate until the Government begins to be serious about tackling obesity.’Dr Partha Kar, associate clinical director for diabetes for NHS England, said the figures ‘confirm the importance of the action set out in the NHS Long Term Plan including expanding the NHS Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Programme so that 200,000 every year can benefit’. "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3844917.1554064984!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"national maternity strategy funding for new elements halted","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Health Service Executive  says the €4.1 million provided for the National Maternity Strategy  this year is the “existing level of service funding” needed to pay for posts approved in previous years. Photograph: Anthony DevlinPAFunding for new developments in the National Maternity Strategy has been halted, just three years after the plan was unveiled by then minister for health Leo Varadkar. The Health Service Executive (HSE) says the €4.1 million being provided for the plan this year is the “existing level of service funding” needed to pay for posts approved in previous years. There is no new development funding for the plan in 2019, a spokeswoman confirmed to The .The strategy, which aimed to develop quality, safe, consistent and well-resourced care in the State’s 19 maternity units, was developed in response to official recommendations following the death of Savita Halappanavar in a Galway hospital more than six years ago.Maternity services have been the subject of scrutiny again since the death of Marie Downey and her son, Darragh, in a single room at Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) last week. Two investigations have begun into the deaths of Ms Downey and her son, who were buried at the weekend.Ringfenced fundingWhile progress has been made in some areas, many of the strategy’s 77 recommendations are ongoing or remain to be completed. Patient representative Róisín Molloy, a member of the National Maternity Strategy steering group, criticised the loss of ringfenced funding for the plan. “It is ironic that we are cutting money that should go towards providing a safe maternity system when we are spending so much more on birth injury claims to the State Claims Agency,” she said.Ms Molloy, whose baby, Mark, died as a result of failings at Portlaoise hospital in 2012, said the money that had been intended to go on the maternity strategy was effectively being spent on abortion services since January this year.“The only way to prevent further deaths and injuries to others is to properly fund the maternity strategy and make public servants accountable for their actions,” she said.Ten-year planSinn Féin health spokeswoman Louise O’Reilly said the loss of ringfenced funding was “disappointing but not surprising”. “This job is far from complete,” she added.The 2019 HSE service plan provides for spending of €12 million on termination of pregnancy services, split between hospitals and the community. No figure is given for spending on the maternity strategy.The HSE said the strategy was a 10-year plan and funding to support its implementation would be introduced across its lifetime. Total funding allocated from 2015 to 2019 was €20 million.The Department of Health insisted implementation of the strategy was continuing and it would “fundamentally change how maternity care is delivered in this country”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Protected structures in Rathgar and Terenure to lose gardensCultural and societal changes seen as encouraging more victims to come forwardChaos continues at Westminster as 11 ministers in May\u0026rsquos cabinet urge her to leave EU with no dealIn the Lanarkshire town known as \u0026lsquoLittle Ireland\u0026rsquo identity is a complex issueMoney effectively going to abortion since January, says steering group memberRape Crisis Centre identifies cultural shift towards reporting sexual crimesNurses\u0026rsquo union says overcrowding \u0026lsquoendemic\u0026rsquo in Ireland\u0026rsquos hospitalsSome departments and local authorities are reviewing cookie policiesSocial Justice Ireland says economic benefits \u0026lsquodistributed in grossly unequal fashion\u0026rsquoCommunities need to work with authorities to stamp out fly tipping, Minister saysLeinster Rugby urges people not to focus on \u0026lsquoisolated\u0026rsquo incident in statementFingal County Council chief expected to be named as new head of health serviceIrish Freedom Party wants to run candidates in the European electionsMr Hunt (98) travelled 6,000 miles to see Limerick win Liam McCarthy cup in 2018Simon Harris insists Government has prioritised setting up the legislationMinister of State made remarks on enforcement methods of new drink driving lawsDepartment of the Taoiseach twice refused request for letter to be released under FoIMazars to conduct \u0026lsquoan independent and in-depth\u0026rsquo examination of association"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3844800.1554055183!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish in scotland have mixed feelings about brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFor Father Eamonn Sweeney and his parishioners, concern about an imposition of a hard border in Ireland is the biggest concern. Photograph: Eoin WilsonFr Eamonn Sweeney (73) came to Scotland from Ballycroy, Co Mayo in 1969. For 23 years, he has been parish priest in Coatbridge, the Lanarkshire town known as “Little Ireland” because it is home to large numbers of people of Irish descent.“Shortly after I came to the parish, I did a survey on the makeup of the parish. I visited all the homes... about 1,500, and I found that 13 of the top 15 names were Irish names,” he says.Tracking the precise number of those with Irish heritage across Scotland is difficult. Though problematic, identification as Catholic is sometimes used as a proxy for Irishness. In 2011, the census registered 841,000 Catholics in Scotland, or 15.9 per cent of the population.Unsurprisingly, in a country where issues of ethnicity, religion and identity often find their most visible expressions through football, Fr Sweeney uses the sport to illustrate the pride his parishioners take in their heritage.“It’s my experience that if Ireland were playing Scotland at football, most people that I know would support Ireland,” he says.In Coatbridge, Brexit provokes mixed emotions. Talk of Scottish independence and a united Ireland often accompany grim predictions about the impact the UK’s departure from the EU could have.For Sweeney and his parishioners, concern about an imposition of a hard border in Ireland is the biggest concern. “We don’t want to go back to the days of checkpoints and searches and garrisons.”However, the rights of many in the Lanarkshire town to Irish citizenship offers something of an insurance policy. “I have signed a lot of applications. Since Brexit, I would say 50,” Fr Sweeney says.The number of Irish passport applications from Scotland has multiplied, but from a low base. In 2013 there were just 45. Last year, the number had risen to 800. This year, it has risen again as the Brexit deadline looms ever closer.However, there are many amongst Scotland’s multigenerational Irish community who now find themselves ineligible for citizenship because their ancestors never needed, never wanted, or were never able to apply for Irish citizenship.Fears about travel restrictions remain. “If it’s more difficult to travel backwards and forwards to Ireland... that could impact on the community quite a bit.”‘I just don’t feel it’Though the vast majority of Scotland’s Irish community are Scottish-born, many have a complicated relationship with Scotland and the concept of Scottishness, due in part perhaps to experiences of anti-Catholic or anti-Irish sentiment and Scotland’s role in the British Empire.Filmmaker Tomás Sheridan (36) was born and brought up in Italy with an Irish father. His father’s experience of emigrating from Co Cavan in his early 20s, and then Sheridan’s own move to Scotland at the age of 19, have instilled in him a deeply personal sense of being Irish and an acute discomfort with notions of Britishness.“For me, the word ‘British’ still sounds like a bad word. I associate it with colonialism, imperialism, arrogance and nationalism,” he says. Like many Irish in Scotland, Mr Sheridan has conflicting feelings about Brexit.“On one level I feel sad to see Britain inflict such ridiculous, pointless damage on itself, through what was essentially a misinformation campaign. On a more selfish level, I see Brexit as an opportunity for an independent Scotland and an opportunity for a unified Ireland,” he says.Scottish independence found significant support during the 2014 referendum in working-class communities with high Irish Catholic populations, like Coatbridge, while a 2015 study of voting patterns found 58 per cent of Catholics voted for Scottish independence.Martin Murphy (30), a barber from Edinburgh who works with people with dementia, says Irishness is central to his identity. His grandparents left Foxford, Co Mayo in the 1930s and he takes great pride in the fact that Easter Rising leader James Connolly was born in Edinburgh’s Cowgate.Like many Irish-Scottish, Mr Murphy feels a strong attachment to Ireland and identifies as part of Scotland’s Irish community, but his attachment is tempered. “Most love to love Ireland, but hesitate to consider a return or indeed a first-time move.GAA and CelticTom Devine (73), professor emeritus of history at the University of Edinburgh, questions the existence of a contemporary Irish community in Scotland.He argues that a “splintering” occurred, caused by, among other things, a decrease in religious observance and the emergence of a well-educated Irish Catholic middle class. “You could actually see that from the ’70s and ’80s onwards.“There’s been a transformation of what used to be called the Irish Catholic community. And there’s even therefore a question mark over whether it is any longer a community.”Not everyone agrees. While the largest and most visible section of Scotland’s Irish immigrant community are Scottish-born, recent decades have seen many Irish-born students and young professionals move to Scotland.Among them is Róisín Kelly (31) from Co Sligo, who has lived in Glasgow for five years where she works in the National Library of Scotland. She left Ireland following graduation from university.While Ms Kelly has Irish-born friends and Scottish-born friends of Irish descent, she sees a difference in her experience of the Irish community in Scotland.“I think there probably are different Irish communities. And perhaps it’s different for people that are of descent, and they’ve sort of inherited their parents’ identity and their parents’ experiences.“I think because I don’t have particular interests, such as GAA or supporting Celtic, that I’ve been set aside from certain communities of Irish people here.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photographs: Yves HermanReuters and Niall CarsonPA WireTánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney has played down the significance of remarks by DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds that he would rather remain in the European Union than support British prime minister Theresa May’s exit deal.Mr Dodds told BBC Newsnight that he would “rather stay in the EU and remain rather than risk Northern Ireland’s position” in the United Kingdom after Mrs May saw her Brexit deal defeated in the House of Commons for a third time on Friday.Mr Coveney said that he had heard Mr Dodds’s comments but he said he didn’t believe that the DUP were representing the voters of Northern Ireland on Brexit.Mr Dodds said he did not rule out supporting a “soft Brexit” and that the withdrawal agreement in its current form risked leaving “Northern Ireland behind, causing economic and political ruptures between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom”.However, Mr Dodds did maintain the DUP’s support for Brexit.“We believe the referendum result should be respected and delivered on,” he said and he reiterated his party’s position that it wants Brexit delivered without the Northern Ireland backstop.Pivotal roleAsked if he took any comfort from Mr Dodds’ comments about preferring to remain in the EU rather than back Ms May’s deal, Mr Coveney said he did not take any encouragement from the remark as he did not believe the DUP represented the views of the majority in Northern Ireland.“No, I think, unfortunately, the DUP have not represented Northern Ireland, they have represented a perspective of one community in Northern Ireland and not that community in its entirety either and that is regrettable,” he said“We know that close to 70 per cent of people in Northern Ireland, and that includes many unionists, especially business and farming leaders, support the use of the backstop as an insurance mechanism to prevent the need for physical border infrastructure or checks that would undermine an all island economy.Speaking in Cork, Mr Coveney said that he understood and respected the DUP position as he respected the positions of all other parties in Northern Ireland and they clearly had a pivotal role to play in Westminster but they were not reflecting the views of the majority of people in Northern Ireland.“The DUP does not represent majority opinion in Northern Ireland - they hold ten seats in Westminster which is obviously an important group of votes for the government but the Irish government’s position is reflected by majority support in Northern Ireland which is not the case with the DUP’s position.”Independent Unionist, Lady Sylvia Hermon made a similar point during a debate in the House of Commons on Friday but Mr Dodds responded by pointing out that the DUP represented more people in Northern Ireland “than anybody else”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar will meet with Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel this week to discuss plans for the EU in the case of a no-deal Brexit. File photograph:  Alberto PezzaliNurPhoto via Getty ImagesTaoiseach Leo Varadkar will discuss what the EU should do if British prime minister Theresa May cannot pass the Withdrawal Agreement in a final attempt when he meets the French and German leaders this week.Today begins a vital week as the House of Commons holds further votes on Brexit options this evening, amid continuing chaos at Westminster.There were informal contacts between Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Britain’s effective deputy prime minister David Lidington over the weekend, but the Irish Government remains in the dark about Mrs May’s intentions.Officials say a key decision for Mrs May will be whether or not to pursue a softer Brexit, over the objections of a majority of her own MPs, if parliament votes for it.Mr Varadkar will travel to Paris tomorrow to meet the French president Emmanuel Macron, while the German chancellor Angela Merkel comes to Dublin on Thursday.Sources with knowledge of preparations for the meetings say the leaders are likely to discuss what the EU should do if the UK does not ratify the Withdrawal Treaty before the April 12th deadline, and what the EU’s response should be if the British seek a shorter extension without European Parliament elections.At the European Council summit in Brussels 10 days ago, EU leaders set Friday week as Brexit day if the UK does not ratify the Withdrawal Agreement. However, they also left the door open to a longer extension of article 50, delaying the UK’s exit, if the UK proposes another way forward.However, EU leaders made clear if the UK is going to stay in the union after May 22nd, it would have to hold elections to the European Parliament – something Mrs May has been against.Mr Macron and Dr Merkel are also likely to seek assurances on Irish preparations to deal with the border issue in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The European Commission has made clear to Irish officials they do not want to see physical infrastructure at the Border but that Ireland will be expected to take steps to protect the customs union and single market by introducing checks on goods away from the Border.There was ision in Mrs May’s Cabinet this weekend, with 11 ministers signing a letter urging her to leave the EU without a deal next week, while others said they would resign if that option was pursued.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

equating to four every minute - were detected breaking the speed limit on Britain\u0027s roads.That figure is up a third on the same period six years ago when just over 1.7 million drivers were caught going too fast.The sharp rise has been put down to the continued roll out of speed cameras across the country\u0027s road network.In some force areas the number of drivers flashed for speeding has soared by more than 400 per cent.Around half of those who are caught now pay to attend a speed awareness course rather than opting to accept points on their licence.It is estimated that around a quarter of all British drivers have now been on a speed awareness course, and the schemes are believed to generate around £50 million annually for police forces.While constabularies are not supposed to profit from the courses they are able to recoup a maximum of £45 per driver to cover administration costs.The chances of being caught speeding varies widely across the country, with some force areas massively clamping down in recent years.More than 2 million speeding drivers are caught each yearThe Avon and Somerset force area recorded the most speeding motorists last year, successfully catching up with just under 200,000.That figure was up from 38,654 in 2011-12, a staggering rise of 416 per cent over a six year period.Bedfordshire recorded an even higher increase of 428 per cent, going from 14,060 in 2011-12 to 74,297 last year.In both force areas 100 per cent of the drivers were caught as a result of speed cameras.Essex Police was up 269 per cent over the same period going from 25,980 in 2011-12 to 95,967 last year.Is your area a speeding hotspot?Devon and Cornwall also recorded a 204 per cent increase in six years, going from just over 14,000 to almost 43,000 last year.The other areas with the highest number of speeders last year were West Yorkshire with 174,796 the politan Police with 139,318, Thames Valley with 131,401 and Greater Manchester with 101,421.Meanwhile the West Midlands area has recorded a 55 per cent drop in the number of speeders down from 78,087 in 2011-12 to 34,966 last year.Cleveland also recorded a 46 per cent drop while Dorset was down 31 per cent and Sussex 29 per cent.The figures were collated Dr Adam Snow, a lecturer in criminal law at Liverpool John Moores University following research commissioned by the RAC Foundation.RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said the disparity between the figures in different force areas was often down to local policing priorities.He said: It is the job of police and crime commissioners, and chief constables, to target resources appropriately, recognising the issues of greatest local concern.Changes and variations in the numbers of offences detected will reflect not just driver behaviour but also the extent of enforcement activity in any one year.The National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council has defended the use of speed awareness courses insisting they are designed to reduce the number of road casualties.But the number of fatalities on the roads has remained relatively constant over the past six years going from 1,754 in 2012 to 1,793 last year.Motoring groups insist speed awareness courses are more about generating revenue for forces at a time when budgets are under pressure and there is no evidence that they make the roads any safer.Brexit indicative votes: What will MPs be voting on in Parliament today, and how will it work?What happens next for Brexit as MPs prepare for second indicative votes -

Such notions of a halfway house that allows the UK to have the best of all worlds have been rejected by the EU. As such, it is difficult to predict with any great certainty what any future UK trade policy will look like.Much of the Department of International Trade’s focus and capacity to date has been consumed by its colossal task: not only has it had to re-establish the UK as an independent actor at the WTO, create its own trade remedies regime and authority, and accede to the WTO government procurement agreement. It also is tasked with replacing the 40 trade agreements the UK is already party to by virtue of its EU membership.While continuity agreements have been agreed with a small number of countries, including Switzerland, Israel and Chile, there is still much to be done. Larger economies, such as Japan and Canada, have already indicated that they will treat the replication as a fresh negotiation, and for others, such as Turkey, the question as to whether the UK can fully replicate what already exists is entirely dependent on the nature of the future UK-EU relationship.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThis replication process will remain the UK’s overriding trade priority well into the transition period and, perhaps, beyond.\u0026nbspDuring that transition, if it has one, the UK can also begin negotiations with potential new free trade agreement partners. It has already identified New Zealand, Australia, the US and accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Transpacific Partnership (CPTPP—a plurilateral trade agreement made up of 11 countries) as a priority.While Australia and New Zealand will be happy to begin negotiations—knowing that it will buy political goodwill with the UK—nothing will be concluded until there is certainty over the UK’s future relationship with the EU, particularly whether the UK will be in a customs union with the EU and, if so, for how long.Negotiations with the US will prove trickier. Washington is unlikely to play the role of a disinterested observer, and a comprehensive trade deal with the US requires the UK not only gain control of its tariffs, but also fully extricate itself from the EU’s regulatory orbit in areas such as food hygiene. While the US is also pressuring the EU to budge on the chlorinated chicken\u0026nbspissue, it is unlikely to succeed.This leaves the UK in the awkward position of having to choose between prioritising frictionless trade in products of animal origin with its most important trading partner (with implications for Northern Ireland) or reduced friction with the US. However, if and when the UK decides to accept additional friction between the UK and the EU, or it becomes unavoidable due to UK and EU red lines, Britain may decide that the additional marginal cost of further ergence from the EU in order to accommodate American demands is a price worth paying.CPTPP will remain a long-term ambition. Putting aside jokes about whether the Pitcairn Islands qualify the UK as a Pacific power, the accession process is still unclear, and there are other more viable accession candidates such as Thailand and South Korea. Furthermore, there are differences in opinion between the UK and some existing members as to how much leeway the UK would have to negotiate opt-outs. Failure to accede to CPTPP in the short term is not in and of itself an issue for the UK.The gains of CPTPP are predominantly political—the UK will be replicating EU agreements or negotiating new ones with the main economic players of CPTPP anyway—in that attempted accession is designed to signal the UK’s continued commitment to the international rules-based order, something which has been placed in doubt by Brexit, and even merely placing ourselves in a queue partially achieves this.Ultimately, the question of what role the UK will play in the global trading system cannot be fully settled until the UK clarifies the depth and scope of future relationship with the EU. And until and unless it does, Britain’s future trade policy will remain disjointed, and its global role ill-defined.Sam Lowe is a\u0026nbspsenior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform.

So it seems appropriate that Pizza Hut should have the very international, globetrotting Regina Borda fronting its operation as managing director for Europe and Canada. She looks like a UN ambassador who happens to be wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan, For the Love of Pizza. “It’s a magical food,” she says at her base in Holborn. “An opportunity to share.” They ought to parachute her into major conflict zones bearing pizza boxes.Now 45, she was born near Bern in Switzerland to a German father and French mother and had to learn three languages straight off the bat (French, German, Italian). Now she speaks five fluently and can fake it in one or two more. I can certify that her English is perfect. “In Switzerland if you drive 10 minutes in any direction you find people are speaking a different language. So you have to adapt. Otherwise you run out of people to speak to.”After studying “cultural anthropology” at the University of Fribourg, Borda did her MBA in Miami, where she met her Colombian husband. “In Colombia they use different hands for the knife and fork. There is no right way. The advantage of pizza is it’s easier to use your hands. Roll up your sleeves and dig in.”Nadhim Zahawi: the CEO turned children\u0027s ministerShe originally thought of joining the Swiss Foreign Service, but was offered a job by Hershey instead. “I didn’t like Hershey bars, I preferred\u0026nbspLindt. But they were trying to build up their international side, so it was a challenge. Chocolate is so connected to childhood. It depends what you grow up with.” After cranking up operations in Brazil and Japan she took up a post with KFC and landed in Germany. But her husband never learned the language so they went to California and she joined Taco Bell.Other than specialising in “restaurant excellence” and organising scholarships for underprivileged kids, she tried her hand at surfing, but discovered\u0026nbspshe was better at running. “I lacked skill. Anybody can run.” She took up marathon running and missed the 2013 Boston marathon bombing by a whisker, qualifying for the event in the following year in conditions of high security. Her best time is 3.38. “That was my high point,” she says. “After that I lost motivation.”Now she goes running on Hampstead Heath (“fair weather” only) while thinking about “global marketing”. She is adapting to life in the UK. “It’s a bit of a shock after California. But I’ve learned that a nice cup of tea can fix any problem.” She also says “lift” rather than “elevator”, even if her 14-year-old son has now started speaking with a pronounced Texan drawl and insisting on “fries” rather than “chips”.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.But Pizza Hut has likewise retained its American roots. If you walk into the Pizza Hut on the Strand, just down the road from Trafalgar Square, as I did, it feels like walking into smalltown America, with a poster advertising a superhero I hadn’t come across before, “Captain Pizza”.Pizza Hut originated in 1958, in Wichita, Kansas, cofounded by two brothers, Frank and Dan Carney. According to legend, they only had enough room on the sign over the new restaurant for eight letters and a space. Five went to “Pizza”, and they squeezed in “Hut”, partly because the bar they had taken over resembled a hut. They painted the roof red and an icon was born. “They wanted to make it accessible,” says Borda. “We are doing artisan pizza, but it’s American-inspired, not Italian.”Borda says that they are always testing through their customers. But they have conducted semi-scientific blind tasting tests, involving 400 people and a hell of a lot of pizza, of different brands. Pizza Hut pizzas consistently come out ahead of their rivals in terms of crispiness, temperature, texture, cheese. Borda uses the acronym, “JAR”, Just About Right. She also describes the Pizza Hut brand with words like “naïve”, “optimistic”\u0026nbspand “casual”. She adds, “I can say whatever I like about the pizzas, but if it’s not true for customers then it’s not true.” She wants people not just to “buy the brand” but to “buy into the brand”.A View from the Top with Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts A View from the Top with Dragons\u0027 Den star Tej LalvaniA View from the Top: David Frank, the TV exec who upset the QueenA View From The Top: Richard Moross, creator of MOO business cardsWhen the first Tanzanian Pizza Hut opened in 2016, they hit the grand total of 100 countries in which they have a presence. By way of celebrating the achievement, Borda undertook to deliver a pizza on top of Mount Kilimanjaro in association with Yum! Brands. “It took our team six days to get up there. It only took a local expert six hours to run up with the pizza.” She didn’t say if it was still hot when it got to the top. But it’s in the Guinness Book of Records for the “highest pizza delivery on Earth” (19,347 feet).Having hit the highest altitude, Borda feels obliged to point out, “It’s not pretentious haute cuisine, it’s down to earth.” But they are adapting to different contemporary trends. You can now buy a vegan pizza in Pizza Hut. “It still has to be the best-tasting vegan pizza,” she says. They’ve also gone digital. Press a button and it gets delivered. The other innovation is paying up front for the pizza. “Somebody still brings you your pizza,” says Borda. “You can see your pizza being made in front of you. But when you’re done you leave. People like to be in control.” One thing I liked about the Pizza Hut on the Strand is that they throw in the salads for free. And, if you get that far, there are unlimited M\u0026ampMs to go on the ice cream.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Even when things have reached crisis proportions, they prefer to keep their counsel. It’s simply not done to rock the boat.\u0026nbspIt’s heavily frowned upon and could be seen as drawing attention to problems besetting the\u0026nbspcompany rather than to the industry or economy as a whole. And, who knows, one day they may require a favour from the very same authorities they’re attacking.\u0026nbspWhich is why the decision, finally, of Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, to break the vow of silence is so heartening, and so significant. Lewis deserves praise for giving the government both barrels,\u0026nbspaccusing successive ministers of paying far too much attention to car and steel manufacturing, rather than to a sector that employs 3 million people and is “without doubt, strategically important to the UK economy” – yet has no place in the state’s industrial strategy.\u0026nbsp“It’s treated differently from other, so-called traditional industries and I struggle with the logic of that,” said Lewis. “When it comes to helping valuable industries make structural transitions, why wouldn’t we shepherd and help retail’s economic value in the same way that we do steel and cars? We don’t. And frankly, sometimes the way we talk about retail jobs in the UK economy can be a source of anger for me.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 49Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Forensics teams work at the scene of a stabbing in Edmonton in London, England.

Western lowland gorilla Kera, opens presents intended for her daughter Afia, in celebration of  her third birthday at Bristol Zoo GardensEven on its own, his firm dwarfs anything in those industries which receive so much ministerial interest. Tesco has 300,000 employees and 3,400 UK stores, is one of the country’s largest private sector employers, and is worth £22bn.\u0026nbspBut when did you last see a politician appear in one of its aisles to make an announcement? Always, they prefer to address an overalls-wearing workforce on a factory floor or to don a hard hat on a construction site or white coat in a bio-science laboratory. Anywhere, it seems, but a shop.\u0026nbspTesco begins plastic-free trial for selection of fruit and vegetablesWe might be a nation of shopkeepers but try telling that to the government. The result is that retailing is facing disaster. Boarded up outlets are everywhere, daily there is news of another chain in trouble, with yet more closures, and job losses. But precious little is being said, and more importantly, done, about it.\u0026nbspPossibly, it’s a sign of just how low the industry finds itself that Lewis has chosen this moment to speak. In which case, the need for action is even more acute.\u0026nbspHopefully, others will follow suit and support Lewis. Don’t be surprised if they don’t, however. Partly it’s their reluctance to provoke discord and to be in the spotlight. Also, they would rather the shouting was done by the trade body, believing it has more clout than inidual operators.\u0026nbspThat’s true of many sectors, but not so in retailing. Much of the current emergency is caused by the lack of a level playing field between the bricks and mortar and online sellers.\u0026nbspYet, membership of the British Retail Consortium includes the likes of Amazon, the very name that is provoking so much gloom on the high street.\u0026nbspBezos\u0026nbsp– whose company enjoys significant tax advantages over traditional retailers\u0026nbsp(Getty for Wired25)In his address to the British Chambers of Commerce conference in London, Lewis described a “brutal” year for retailers in 2018, with 61,000 jobs lost between March and September.The retail sector pays a quarter of business rates, he noted, with Tesco contributing £700m. Just a 2 per cent levy on digital sales would be sufficient to raise £1.5bn, he said – enough to fund a cut to business rates of 20 per cent. “I would argue business rates are killing the present, damaging our economy,” he said. That is not an argument, the BRC, with its digital members, can make with any degree of conviction.\u0026nbspNumber of shoppers declines at fastest pace in five yearsBut, if it was not for Brexit dominating so much of our media, more coverage would have been afforded to the collapsing high streets. There has been some focus, but not enough. And, in terms of a government action plan containing meaningful measures and figures that will make a positive, real difference (as opposed to those numbers that sound good when they’re proclaimed but once you take into account every town and city in Britain you realise they amount to not very much at all), there is no sign.\u0026nbspIn reply to Lewis, the Treasury stuck to its dismissive mantra of Britain enjoying the lowest corporation tax in the G20 and having announced “substantial reforms to business rates since 2016”. Surely, the fact that the head of the mighty Tesco is so unimpressed, is calling for a 20 per cent reduction and has come up with a solution, ought to command the Treasury’s concentration? Apparently not.\u0026nbspIt’s obvious to anyone that the online-only retailers enjoy enormous advantages. They could be taxed more heavily on their delivery vehicles, and charged a sales levy. And that’s before they’re made to change their ownership structures so that they pay more tax in the UK.\u0026nbspAllied to those moves, a wholesale refurbishment of our shopping districts, so that areas are made more attractive and appealing, as well as efforts to make public transport more accessible\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspparking cheaper and easier, and the outlook for Lewis’s industry could brighten. It may be, too, that we should realise\u0026nbspwe have too many stores and the total needs slimming down.\u0026nbspWell done to Dave Lewis. Now we need more like him. And the government has to listen, and act.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of CTF Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational communications advisory firmWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The service is\u0026nbsppart of £108m of additional freight that is supposed to prevent chaos at Britain’s ports and secure\u0026nbspthe supply of vital goods such as medicines and\u0026nbsporgans for transplants.The government has no use for the space for at least another two weeks because Brexit has been delayed. But Brittany Ferries said it was too late to cancel the 20 extra crossings it will be running each week so space is being sold on the open market.Brittany Ferries altered the travel plans of more than 20,000 passengers with existing bookings when it changed its schedules in January.As part of its contingency planning the Department for Transport also awarded a £14m contract to Seaborne Freight and a £43m contract to Danish shipping firm DFDS. The department terminated its agreement with Seaborne when it became clear that it could not provide the service required. The company had no ships and no financial track record.The government also had to shell out an additional £33m to settle legal action brought by Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel over the DfT’s “secretive and flawed” procurement process. A further £800,000 was spent on consultants who assessed the deals.Brittany said it had incurred extra costs stemming from the contract, including more fuel and higher port fees.“Fifty additional Brittany Ferries’ port staff have been hired on both sides of the Channel to deal with more frequent port calls,” a Brittany spokesperson said.\u0026nbsp“We have also spent the last three months training current onboard teams.“The reality is that we were committed as soon as we signed the contract and preparations began to deliver the dedicated NHS shipment channel. There is no turning back at this late stage because all the preparatory work is now in place for 29 March.”Ramsgate in Kent where Seaborne Freight was to have run its no-deal Brexit ferry service from (AFPGetty)Brittany said it was using its “best endeavours” to re-sell unused capacity\u0026nbspto reduce costs to the taxpayer.\u0026nbspA government spokeswoman said it was “only right that we push on with contingency measures”.She added: “The government’s freight capacity contracts run for six months and are a vital part of wider contingency planning. They provide capacity for critical goods, including vital medicines, to continue to enter the UK in a no-deal scenario.“Due to the agreed extension until 12 April, tickets for the first two weeks have been released for sale on the open market, which will minimise costs for the taxpayer.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”.

Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. The film, which came out on 29 March in the US,\u0026nbspwas expected to top $50m\u0026nbsp(£38m) over the first three days of its release – and has now landed slightly below this prediction.Disney has two other high-profile live-action remakes coming out this year: Aladdin is scheduled to premiere on 24 May, while The Lion King\u0026nbspis set to hit theatres on 19 July.Additional reporting by agenciesThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were described as showing a New iPhone XR – but if that is correct, it likely refers to the phone that will take the XR\u0027s place as the cheaper and mid-sized part of next year\u0027s line-up.However, the phone of this design is actually thought to be the iPhone 11, or whatever\u0026nbspthe follow-up to the current iPhone XS is named. The new version of the XR is expected to have just two cameras in its back – an extra one compared to its predecessor, and the same number as the more premium phones in the line-up.Apple apologises to MacBook owners about broken keyboardsIt is still not clear what Apple will do with the wide variety of cameras in the iPhone 11: rumours have suggested that the extra one could be used for augmented reality features, or for improving the phone\u0027s performance in situations that would be otherwise difficult to photograph. The two lenses in the XS – and presumably in the new version of the XR – have one wide angle and another more zoomed in lens.All of the phones are expected to arrive in September, when Apple traditionally releases its new handsets.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So why did he love such a ridiculous game, asks\u0026nbspMatt OwenClick to followThe IndependentPosing for a portrait in Paris following the announcement of his Nobel Prize triumph in 1957On 16 October 1957, Albert Camus was eating lunch at a restaurant in the heart of Paris’s Latin Quarter. Partway through the meal, a young man from his publisher’s office appeared. The young man dismissed the waiter, and informed Camus of what had just been announced on the radio: he was receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature.One week later, Camus was interviewed on French television. However, the author and his interlocutor weren’t sat in a comfy studio, discussing the power of the written word. They were sat in the Parc des Princes, among a crowd of 35,000, watching Racing Club de Paris host Monaco. The black-and-white footage is preserved on YouTube. Wrong-footed, the Racing keeper reacts slowly to a deflected cross, letting the ball bobble inside his near post. We cut to the stands, where Camus – looking more than ever like a softer-faced Humphrey Bogart – is asked about the keeper’s blunder. He implores us not to be too hard on him.As far as I’m aware, this is the only time that a fresh recipient of the Nobel Prize has been interviewed at a football match. (That this registers as incongruous, vaguely comical, is in part the topic of this essay.) Thanks almost entirely to a much-circulated misquote – “all that I know most surely about morality and obligations I owe to football” – Camus’\u0026nbspfondness for the game is well-known. But this fondness was more than a passing wistfulness, or a single throwaway aphorism. In 1959, less than a year before he died, Camus told another interviewer that, along with the theatre, the football pitch had been one of his two “real universities”. In football, one of the greatest French authors of the 20th century located the most potent and valuable forms of consciousness. In the game’s drama of the flesh, he felt himself witness to the fullness of life, in all its pathos, and all its saving graces.Explaining its decision, the Nobel Committee declared that Camus’\u0026nbsp“clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times”. This bland bit of PR distracts from the intensity and anguish of Camus’\u0026nbspwork. The central problem that he wrestled with was simple: life is absurd. Why? Because we are filled with a “longing for happiness and for reason”, but are met everywhere by “the unreasonable silence of the world”. Modernity has blasted away the old consolations of religion, revealing the universe to be a great, cold blank. Our souls yearn for transcendence, but, as Beckett writes in Waiting for Godot, we “give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it’s night once more”. This basic mismatch, between our psychic craving and what reality provides, is what renders life absurd. Camus compared human existence to that of Sisyphus, who in Greek mythology was condemned by Zeus to roll a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, over and over, for eternity.And so what to do? Suicide isn’t an option. This would only compound the absurdity, and in any case Camus adored the experience of being alive the tragedy was precisely that reality was so sumptuous, yet was forever slipping away “between my fingers, like beads of mercury”. But Camus couldn’t accept the “philosophical suicide” of religion, either. Though he was fascinated by religious devotion – and, like so many people who spend their life drowning in words, occasionally told friends he intended to retreat to a monastery – it wasn’t in him. His bouts of asceticism would always wane. Camus wanted to be in the world, to face it squarely without succumbing to either despair or delusion, both of which he regarded as forms of psychic surrender.The parallels between \u0027The Plague\u0027 and London’s problem with crimeOur only remaining option, as Camus saw it, was a total, full-hearted acceptance of our predicament. Each of us is condemned by the cosmos each of us has our boulder to roll. But “the struggle toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart”, if we let it. In Camus’\u0026nbspphilosophy, meaning and value derive from a defiant and personal creativity. His was a sort of ecstatic nihilism. We are destined for oblivion, Camus said we all know that, whether or not we like to talk about it. But like Sisyphus, we can live with “the certainty of a crushing fate, without the resignation that ought to accompany it”, if we make the choice to imbue our condition with passionate endeavour. In the “wild and limited universe of man”, we can all find ways to shoulder our boulder with a determined, defiant smile.What could be more absurd than 22 people chasing a sphere of inflated leather around a rectangle of grass for 90 minutes?And for Camus, one of those things that “negates the gods and raises rocks” was football. Long before he wrote a word about Sisyphus, Camus was falling in love with the game. Like many of the greatest players, he discovered this love in poverty. Camus was a war orphan, raised in an Algiers slum by an illiterate single mother. His grandmother constantly chastised him for playing football because it risked damaging his school boots, which had been a great expense for the family. But Camus wasn’t deterred. The First Man – the autobiographical novel he was working on at the time of his death – follows a young boy called Jacques. In childhood, football is Jacques’\u0026nbsp“kingdom”, and through adolescence he is “obsessed” with the game. Jacques was Camus, whose early experiences of playing football took place on rough-drawn Algerian fields with “a ball made of rags”.Through school, Camus was regarded as an excellent player, both (curiously enough) in goal and up front. He went on to play between the sticks for the Algiers Racing University (the RUA). In 1930, the team bulletin praised the 16-year old Camus for giving “a splendid exhibition”. Less than two months after this bulletin, though, Camus’\u0026nbsplife changed forever. The teenager began spitting blood it was the dreaded tuberculosis. (Some of the Camus family were convinced it was the result of him standing in the cold after a match.) Tuberculosis put an end to any hopes Camus might have had of seriously playing football – just as it later prevented him from enlisting to fight both Franco and the Nazis. His lungs only got worse, and he had to be careful with exerting himself for the rest of his days.\u0026nbspCamus’\u0026nbsplove of the game never waned, though. In his twenties, while still in Algeria, he loved to watch local teams play. During his first jobs in Paris journalism, Camus would wait eagerly on Sunday nights for the scores to come in, hoping his beloved RUA had claimed victory. Working as a teacher in 1941, he coached the school team, and even played again (he was shocked at his lack of fitness). When, in June of 1944, the Allies landed on the Normandy beaches, his immediate experience of the event was the cancellation of a championship game in Paris. And in 1949, on a lecture tour of Brazil, Camus’\u0026nbsphandlers were delighted when their guest asked to attend a local match.Football lit up Camus’\u0026nbspyouth, and he continued to watch it his whole life, feeling deprived when he lived somewhere without a team. Like Gonzales in his novel The Plague (1947), he was known among friends for never passing up the chance to kick a can down the street. A love of the game drifts in the background of all his novels. This writer – this intense thinker who perceived that everything was Sisyphean, who proclaimed that the only way to live was to revolt relentlessly against meaninglessness – loved a mere game. Loved it with as much intensity and consistency as he loved anything. Why?Consider this: what could be more absurd than 22 people chasing a sphere of inflated leather around a rectangle of grass for 90 minutes, and believing that the amount of times said sphere crosses a couple of painted lines is a matter of the most profound importance? In any sort of rational analysis, football is fundamentally ridiculous. A flurry of imaginary meaning.\u0026nbspBut in the absurdist analysis, human striving of any sort is fundamentally ridiculous, and all meaning is at bottom imaginary. Zoom out until yours is the long view of the cosmos, and there is no essential difference between chasing a football and chasing a career, or a first home, or the eradication of racial injustice, or your soulmate. All of our huffing and puffing will exhaust itself and be forgotten, in time. To find meaning anywhere, Camus thought, required approaching life with more than cold reason. It required filtering reality through different states of being. Like many people who have known real poverty in their youth, Camus was first and foremost a pragmatist. He wanted to know what worked. And like Ivan in\u0026nbspFyodor\u0026nbspDostoyevsky’s\u0026nbspThe Brothers\u0026nbspKaramazov\u0026nbsp– a book he liked so much he adapted it for the stage – Camus sensed that what gave life meaning were those things you love “not with your mind, not with logic, but with your insides, your guts”.Parc des PrincesThis belief that rationalism has its limits is one of the reasons Camus was always a fragile fit within the Paris intelligentsia. During the war, he was editor-in-chief of the resistance newspaper Combat. His Left Bank acquaintances shared his loathing of the Nazi occupation and approved of his impassioned and melancholy editorials. But over the next decade, Camus’\u0026nbsprelationship with the Paris intelligentsia – most famously with their chief whip, Jean-Paul Sartre – deteriorated. As the horrors of Soviet rule began to surface, Sartre and others declared that the ideals were worth the casualties, that the gulags were a regrettable but necessary cost of creating an egalitarian society. Camus was aghast that, among his fellow writers, “concentration-camp rule is adored as an instrument of liberation”. A down payment in blood for a potential future utopia wasn’t worth the gamble.\u0026nbspHe said: “It is better to be wrong by killing no one than to be right with mass graves.” Camus’\u0026nbsprejection of Stalinism made him a pariah on the French left, for whom the USSR was the great political hope. During the Algerian War, pressed to support the anti-colonial mission of the Algerian guerrilla forces, Camus famously remarked that “bombs are being planted in the trams in Algiers. My mother could be on one of those trams. If that is justice, I prefer my mother.” This\u0026nbspstance triggered his final split with the French left, to whom prioritising a single life over a grand political ideal seemed provincial, simple-minded.Camus’\u0026nbsplove of football can only be understood in light of these broader intellectual struggles. By the mid-Fifties, he was convinced that an airy, insulated idealism had infected much contemporary thought with a sort of anaemic dishonesty. To Camus, giving the thumbs-up to communist mass murder is exactly the sort of thing that happens when intellectuals\u0026nbspprioritise theories over actual human beings.\u0026nbspCamus had come to believe that the style of thinking he found in Paris – “a metropolis of wickedness, of denigration and systemic lying” – was abstracted from real life, cut off from embodied experiences of suffering and joy. After he was awarded the Nobel Prize, he was delighted when he returned to Algiers to escape the publicity, and a taxi driver recognised him not as a famous writer, but as the former RUA goalkeeper.Camus’\u0026nbsp1956 novel The Fall contains his most autobiographical protagonist, Jean-Baptiste Clamence. “I have never truly been sincere and enthusiastic except when I used to play sports,” Clamence tells the reader. To this day, he goes on, acting in theatre and “Sunday football matches in a crowded stadium” are the only places “I feel innocent”. It was around this same time that Camus was asked by the RUA’s alumni magazine to reflect on his playing days, and responded by saying that “after many years in which the world has afforded me many experiences, what I most surely know in the long run about morality and the obligations of men... I learned it with RUA.”\u0026nbspThis grand remark contains within it all the disillusionment of Camus’\u0026nbspprevious decade in Paris. With it, he was doing two things: he was rejecting what he saw as the dehumanising “abstraction” of Sartrean pontification, suggesting that the psychic tumult of a football match was a more honest ethical realm than the smoky cafes of the Left Bank. Nested in this was also a broader critique about reason at large, an expression of Camus’\u0026nbsplifelong scepticism towards the idea that brow-furrowed rumination constitutes the high road to wisdom. Contrary to cerebral types’ tendency to regard football (or any sport) as base, childlike, dumbly physical, Camus was honouring the game as a way to “possess wisdom about life in an immediate way, not from a great distance”.It is fairly easy to misrepresent the sort of person you are in daily life, or on the page – it is nearly impossible to tell the same lie while in the heat of physical competitionPart of “the obligations of men” had to do with a sincere and honest camaraderie. He felt betrayed by a group of people who – during those years when they were united by the singular purpose of ousting the Nazis – had felt briefly like a team. The betrayal crushed him. Camus has probably come out on the right side of history, but he spent his actual life on the wrong side of much popular opinion. His letters reveal that he was often lonely, and felt abandoned by people he had considered friends.\u0026nbspOn a more inidual level, Camus – who regarded the world around him as mired in a moral confusion that stemmed from of a lack of self-knowledge – believed that the embodied and intense struggle of a football match revealed people to themselves. He thought that it stripped away certain artifices of character, the narcissisms foisted on us by the social, and offered a mirror. I suspect that anyone who has ever played has an idea of what he means. In my teens, football taught me things about myself that weren’t nice: I would throw my hands up when it got difficult, I would hector less skilled teammates when they made mistakes, I couldn’t be arsed to improve my weak left foot. It taught me better things, too: I wasn’t selfish in front of goal I didn’t want to hurt people when my friends were badly fouled I would retaliate on their behalf with an anger that shocked me. These are insights I couldn’t have uncovered in a library. To this day, they aid in my ongoing efforts to be better person, a bigger person. As Camus saw, it is fairly easy to misrepresent the sort of person you are in daily life, or on the page – it is nearly impossible to tell the same lie while in the heat of physical competition.\u0026nbspTorun Moberg after being awarded his 1957 Nobel Prize in Stockholm (Getty)Then there are the deeper reasons that Camus located a sort of magic in football. These were more apolitical – in the way that all the profundity we discover in childhood is apolitical, and in the way that Sisyphus’s predicament runs much deeper than politics. Throughout his life, Camus dabbled in the writings of the Buddha, and kept a little wooden statuette of the ancient sage on his mantelpiece. As he grew older, Camus came to appreciate the Buddha’s grounding insight: the vast majority of human suffering begins in the gnashing, incessant movements of the mind. Camus enjoyed all sorts of sensual pleasure. He loved dancing he enjoyed sardines washed down with Cinzano in the week before he died he wrote love letters to five different women. But he was never a hedonist. Tracing the thread of his diaries, you see that what he sought most of all was a contented but focussed stillness, accessible in glimpses just the other side of sensory rapture. As he got older, Camus discovered this more and more in nature, in “gospels of stone, sky and water”. He sought a life “that is full of the signs of the sea and the rising song of the crickets”. But, like Jacques of The First Man, I suspect that the first place he ever alighted on such an illuminated state of being was on those Algerian fields, with the balls made of rags.\u0026nbspI recall with the same intensity that I recall my first kiss watching a half-volley leave my laces like a cannonball and meet the crossbar with a sound that was the core of the earth rattling. It was a bright Sussex summer’s day, a league game, I must have been about 14. In the memory I am in a trance all of reality is distilled in the bright point of the moving ball. Its hexagons are scuffed and peeling against a perfect blue sky. I am briefly without biography. Everyone who ever played has these memories, and even players who have never stopped for a moment to consider the nature of thinking know it: football can blast away all the noise. When you’re playing well, your perception is distilled to vision and reaction, and the hot lens of awareness is made the plaything of other forces: muscles, flesh, the lungs, those older parts of us that evolved long before the cortex with its unending, corrosive commentary. The best things you ever do on the football field only become known to you seconds after you have done them. You can feel briefly like pure movement, a natural force without a name. You are more embedded in the world than ever, even as you are constantly forgetting yourself. And while you’re there, the beads of mercury are not slipping between your fingers but instead frozen, paused, in the timelessness of play. This intoxicating headspace is football’s spiritual secret. It is the thing that players become so addicted to, from the age when the ball is bigger than their skull through to the age where they need two knee braces just to risk a kickaround. Of his youth, the author Karl Ove Knausgard wrote that playing football was “the only place where I was completely spared from invasive thoughts, where it was all about being physically present”. Camus, I suspect, would have read this with a pang of recognition.What of watching football, though? Camus only occasionally kicked a ball past the age of 16, but he loved the game for the rest of his days, and never stopped watching it. Well, for one, there was every football fan’s simple act of picking a clan and going vicariously to battle. Camus always followed RUA’s results, and went on to support Racing Club de Paris (as in his post-Nobel interview) because they played in the same blue and white hoops as his university team. And all of fandom Camus would have seen as a microcosm of the absurdity of existence. I suspect he quietly revelled in the joyous irrationality of it, because he would have seen how everything that is true of Sisyphus’s life is true of being a football fan. Playing for or supporting a team is an investment with no hope of any permanent happy ending. If we lose, we’ll have to roll the boulder back up the hill. And even if we win, even if we keep winning, we’ll eventually lose, and then we’ll have to roll the boulder back up the hill.\u0026nbspThere is no moment forthcoming when any football team, no matter how good, will solve football’s last theorem, allowing us all to pack up and go home. Such an aspiration is nonsensical precisely because it belongs in the realm of the rational. The point, as with theatre, is to keep taking to the stage even though eventually the lights will always come up and you’ll remember it was all a make-believe. Every time England crash out of a major international tournament, through a glum beery haze, I receive a text from my father: “Next time.” It isn’t a question of whether either of us believe it it’s about two years from now, when we’ll need to shoulder the boulder again, with the same irresistible, brittle, childlike hope. It’s about imagining celebration, when the world is quietly promising you further dismay. Perhaps the only sort of faith left for a people who have traded gods and saints for playmakers and number nines.Created with Sketch.The 15 best opening lines in literature Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.”215 Anna Karenina, by Leo Tolstoy“All happy families are alike but an unhappy family is unhappy after its own fashion.”315 A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.”415 Wuthering Heights, by Emily Brontë“I have just returned from a visit to my landlord – the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with, which pitches you straight into the story.”515 Middlemarch, by George Eliot“Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress.”615 Nineteen Eighty-Four, by George OrwellIt was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.715 The Great Gatsby, by F.

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.In The Outsider, the protagonist Meursault sees the players from the local team returning to town on a tram after a victory, “yelling and singing at the tops of their voices that their team would never die”. But they will, won’t they? Age will come for even the greatest players, eventually. Someday soon the absurd cosmos will commit the terrible crime of rendering Lionel Messi too old to keep up. And yet: what Camus called “the miraculous nature of the body’s mechanics” can lift us clear of mundane experience, with its march of time. A strange truth about football: large stretches of it are\u0026nbspboring. But Camus, like millions of others, sat though long stretches of the forgettable for those moments when a player hangs in the night air and cushions the ball on his instep with perfect tenderness when a pass with languid backspin moves through a diagonal cross-field arc like a fallen star when a string of one-twos cut through a back four in triangles of ine geometry.\u0026nbspSuch moments are about more than technical precision. Our absurd predicament is at bottom physical: it is the physical deterioration of cells and neurons that will do for us, in the end. But each time a bit of football is done well, something is stolen from the predictable entropy of the material. And the better the player, the bigger the steal. This is why everyone wants to watch the best because the finest players can seem to evade altogether the laws of physical being. The Uruguayan poet Eduardo Galeano wrote that “the entire paying field fit inside” Di Stefano’s boots that Pele evaded opponents “without ever touching the ground” and that Maradona “has eyes all over his body”. All great pieces of play are fundamentally unlikely, their execution Promethean. To be brilliant with the body is to shake your first at Zeus’s wrath, and to witness it is to discover what Camus thought made the game worth the candle: moments of glorious, earthbound, vanishing transcendence. Even slumped on the sofa with a curry in your lap, the intense moments of viewing give a flash of that pure presence, don’t they? Don’t you catch yourself watching with your body, heading an invisible ball or shaping to slot it inside an invisible far post? Beauty, Camus wrote, is like “a flash of eternity in a minute that we would like to stretch out across the length of time”. Football, for him, was one long insatiable pursuit of beauty – in the playing, and in the watching.The only real paradises, wrote Proust, are the paradises we have lost. For Camus, his pre-tubercular youth and his best footballing days were woven together, into a time before life’s morbid truths came for him. His was an acute example, but in it there is something universal. Everyone who deeply loves the game played it, and remembers playing it with a purity and abandon that’s harder to muster than once upon a time. It is no coincidence that every football lover’s golden memory – their sort of Edenic conception of the game, the pure and careless version that each subsequent version looks back on with an impossible, doomed longing – is that of playing in the park with their mates as a kid. This is football’s creation myth, the thing that links the millionaire ex-pro pundit with the bloke ranting on a phone-in. The mysticism of jumpers for goalposts. It is why Camus, in The Fall, uses that funny word, “innocence”. There was a time, a time you only really tasted once it was gone, when the body moved with the lightness of pure fire, when your attention was made as sharp and as clear as cut glass. There was a time when the ethics of this intractable, impenetrable life were as simple as play to the whistle and shake hands at the end. Briefly, football gave us that. And we can never forgive it, nor stop loving it.Camus never stopped. Two years before his death, he bought a house in Lourmarin, a sleepy mountain village 50\u0026nbspmiles north of Marseille. He got to know the players from the local football team, paying for their kits and drinking coffee with them after games. Probably he would have kept on this way for years. But on New Year’s Day of 1960, Camus’\u0026nbsplong-time friend and publisher, Michel Gallimard, offered to drive him from the south of France back to Paris. Camus already had a train ticket, but decided at the last moment to join his friend for the drive. A mechanic who had recently repaired Gallimard’s car had told him it was “a coffin on wheels”. He was proved right. The car went off the road and hit a tree Camus was killed instantly.\u0026nbspThe unfinished manuscript of The First Man, with its vision of the boy Jacques making a kingdom of football, was found in the boot of the crashed car. A year earlier, Camus had told a friend that he had written only a third of his complete works, that he felt he was just getting going. Previously, he had said to friends that, as the epitome of random cruelty, nothing could be more absurd than dying in a car crash. After his death, he was buried up in the hills of Lourmarin. At his funeral, the local players carried his coffin.See the 2018 Man Booker Prize shortlist in full100 years of JD Salinger: The world\u0027s most famous literary hermitHow women were airbrushed from the Golden Age of sci-fiToni Morrison – Mouth Full of Blood review: Unashamedly ambitiousIn The Football Man (1968), Arthur Hopcraft wrote that football “has conflict and beauty, and when those two qualities are present together in something offered for public appraisal they represent much of what I understand to be art”.\u0026nbspArt constitutes Homo sapiens’ oldest way of pulling meaning and transcendence out of the void, and in football Camus perceived an art form. To him, the game was of a piece with theatre a drama of physical action that replaced the trappings of reason with the reality of the embodied. There is no final consolation forthcoming, Camus declared there is no escaping our absurd predicament. This life, this right-now, is all we have. And so pour yourself out. The raw teachings of the physical, an unabashed love of irrational play, the echoes of the innocent pathos of youth small moments of transcending our material prison. This was Camus’\u0026nbspbeautiful game.\u0026nbsp“If I were to die, in the midst of cold mountains, unknown to the world, cast off by my own people, my strength at last exhausted, the sea would at the final moment flood into my cell, come to raise me above myself and help me die without hatred.” One of Camus’\u0026nbspother great loves was swimming, especially in the ocean. During the six years I spent living in Vancouver – the last period of my life, I suspect, during which I will play football in any serious way – at the height of summer, I would play on a roasting Saturday morning until my legs were sour with trembling and my face was crusted with sweat. Then I would cycle back over to the beach by where I lived and wade out into the Pacific. The water shockingly cold, I would keep wading and then I would e, feel the grime wash off me and feel the salt of my pores mix with the salt of the deep and feel my muscles began to pulse with a prickly numbness. I would surface and breathe. The sun would be blinding off the water. I would fill my lungs and float. On good days I would have done something special on the ball, and I would still be able to feel it lingering in my body like a memory, movement’s ghost on the outside of my foot, the hollow of my chest, the flat of my thigh. On bad days, I would focus on the floating, and try to let the self-recriminations wilt. Later that afternoon, I would head downtown to watch the Vancouver Whitecaps, to watch men do it better than me. Those were perfect hours. All of it shaking a rueful, happy fist at the empty sky. Just a game. Paradises lost and found. Just a game.With thanks to Andy Martin and Robert ZaretskyClick here to subscribe to The Blizzard, from £20 per year.

Four hours after PMQs, May promised Conservative MPs she would stand down if the Commons approved her Brexit deal.It was enough to persuade several Eurosceptics to back her agreement. For a few hours, there was real hope in Downing Street that a majority was finally in sight.Then normal service resumed. The Democratic Unionist Party restated its opposition, halting the Tory momentum towards backing the deal. May’s gamble had failed. A joke did the rounds in parliament: May was so useless, she couldn’t even resign properly. No Margaret Thatcher, certainly.Created with Sketch.The front pages on what would have been Brexit Day Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.March 29 2019 - The original date for Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, what do the newspapers have to say about it?The  focuses on the fact that today was the original day for Britain\u0027s departure from the EUThe Daily Mail warns MPs that they have one last chance to back the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit dealThe Independent Daily Edition reports that the Prime Minister is gambling as she holds a vote today on the withdrawal agreementThe Sun reports that the Prime Minister last night sought to convince DUP leader Arlene Foster to back her deal reports that some ministers want the Prime Minister to step down now, while Michael Gove becomes the favourite at the bookies to replace herThe i reports that Boris Johnson is preparing his leadership bid for when the Prime Minister resignsThe Times reports that Brexit may be delayed for a further yearThe Daily  reports that the Prime Minister is making a desperate final plea to pass her Brexit deal through the house of commonsThe Financial Times reports on the Brexit Betrayal march that will reach London today after setting off from Sunderland with the intention of reaching London on Brexit dayThe Daily Mirror reports on the Prime Minister\u0027s difficulty passing her deal through the commonsThe Daily Star calls on its readers to shut up about BrexitMarch 29 2019 - The original date for Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, what do the newspapers have to say about it?The  focuses on the fact that today was the original day for Britain\u0027s departure from the EUThe Daily Mail warns MPs that they have one last chance to back the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit dealThe Independent Daily Edition reports that the Prime Minister is gambling as she holds a vote today on the withdrawal agreementThe Sun reports that the Prime Minister last night sought to convince DUP leader Arlene Foster to back her deal reports that some ministers want the Prime Minister to step down now, while Michael Gove becomes the favourite at the bookies to replace herThe i reports that Boris Johnson is preparing his leadership bid for when the Prime Minister resignsThe Times reports that Brexit may be delayed for a further yearThe Daily  reports that the Prime Minister is making a desperate final plea to pass her Brexit deal through the house of commonsThe Financial Times reports on the Brexit Betrayal march that will reach London today after setting off from Sunderland with the intention of reaching London on Brexit dayThe Daily Mirror reports on the Prime Minister\u0027s difficulty passing her deal through the commonsThe Daily Star calls on its readers to shut up about BrexitThe episode epitomises May’s premiership. It has been punctuated by mistakes. She did not want to be “the Brexit prime minister”, and longed to pursue a domestic agenda.\u0026nbspShe judged, rightly, that the 2016 referendum result was not really a vote against the EU, but a cry from the “left-behind”.Her speech in Downing Street on becoming prime minister, pledging to help the “just about managing” and to root out “burning injustice”, was pitch perfect. But she never lived it up to it. True, there were initiatives – some welcome, such as a race disparity audit. But any prospect of a coherent, meaty agenda was eclipsed long ago by Brexit, which, in Whitehall speak, left little “bandwidth” in the government machine for much else.May never really recovered from her early Brexit errors. As a reluctant Remainer, she was desperate to reassure Brexiteers she would deliver on the referendum result. The pivotal moment was the Tory conference in October 2016.In a speech drafted by her close aide Nick Timothy – which, crucially, bypassed the Whitehall machine – May set the red lines which would dominate the Brexit negotiations. The UK would leave the customs union, end the free movement of people (which would mean leaving single market) and end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Senior civil servants were appalled some believed May did not understand how she was closing off her options.One of the bitter ironies of the Brexit saga is that only now, with parliament trying to seize the reins, is there a proper and long overdue debate about the merits of the customs union and the single market. \u0026nbspThe one thing I underestimated when I went into No 10 was the extent to which the prime minister is steeped in the DNA of the Conservative PartyIn her conference speech May, under intense pressure from Tory Eurosceptics to get a move on, promised to trigger the two-year Article 50\u0026nbspexit process by March 2017. Some allies now concede this was premature, as she did not have a clear vision of what she wanted.Her rigid red lines might have worked if she had sought a limited, Canada-style free trade agreement, which the EU would have accepted. But, with Whitehall and business warning about the economic cost of ending frictionless trade and a slender majority of 12 in a Commons with Remainers in the ascendancy, May would struggle to secure UK approval for such a deal. The answer, May was told by cabinet ministers Philip Hammond and David Davis, was to call a general election and secure a big majority.Although she had originally ruled one out, she was persuaded to U-turn, with opinion polls raising her allies’ hopes she could win a majority of 80. It was her second fatal mistake. She wanted a “Brexit election” but Jeremy Corbyn had other ideas, exposing May’s Achilles heel on domestic policy by focusing on austerity.May’s loss of her overall majority meant that today’s power struggle between the government and the Commons was only a matter of time. Yet she remained in denial about the parliamentary arithmetic. She could have changed course towards the soft Brexit majority among MPs, but rejected overtures for her to reach across the aisle, and reach out to the 48 per cent she had neglected since the referendum.Despite warning of the hard choices ahead, May consistently put them off in an attempt to ensure her own survival and preserve Tory unity.She defied her critics by getting the EU negotiations over the line at crucial stages, but without resolving the fundamental contradiction in her strategy. She pledged to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland\u0026nbspand, under pressure from the Democratic Unionist Party on whose Commons votes she depended, promised to avoid a different regulatory and tariff regime in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. But she also insisted the UK must be able to strike trade deals with non-EU countries. She has still not solved this puzzle and the DUP remains opposed to her withdrawal agreement.May tried to square the circle when she finally produced her Chequers blueprint. But she failed to win the frictionless trade she sought in the fraught negotiations with the EU.\u0026nbspShe and her ministers made a series of miscalculations. They approached the talks as if they were a traditional EU negotiation among 28 partners, not realising that it would be 27 versus one. They were convinced the UK could “ide and rule” but the EU maintained iron discipline and unity. May tried to woo her fellow leaders, but they deliberately left the European Commission in the driving seat. (It was revealing that the first cracks finally showed this month when the 27 leaders rather than the European Commission decided on an Article 50 extension.)The EU thus called the shots and fixed the timetable. May’s naive hopes that a long-term trade agreement would be sorted by exit day today were dashed. The EU insisted on first resolving the UK’s orce payment, citizens’ rights and a backstop to prevent a hard Irish border – with no talks on the future relationship until after the UK’s departure.Created with Sketch.Brexit billboards: Campaigners remind MPs of past promises Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage has spent his political career campaigning for the UK to leave the EU.Boris Johnson\u0027s support for Brexit took many by surprise before the EU referendum.The UK and EU are yet to agree on a withdrawal deal.

Even when May’s diplomacy worked – she secured a UK-wide customs union instead of a Northern Ireland-only one – it antagonised the noisy Eurosceptics. The withdrawal agreement which emerged left them seething at “Brexit in name only”, while pro-Europeans saw it as much worse than EU membership, fuelling demands for a Final Say referendum.In another catastrophic error, May made a televised address in which she blamed the deadlock on parliament, insulting the very\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsp– particularly on the Labour side – whose votes she so desperately neededMay’s prioritising of Tory unity failed to prevent 28 ministerial resignations (18 of them over Brexit) in less than three years, more than Thatcher suffered in 11. The departures did not ensure cabinet unity – far from it. Discipline has broken down. May has been pushed one way and then another by resignation threats from Brexiteer and pro-EU ministers.Her once-admired resilience is now seen as stubbornness by frustrated ministers, who long for her to give a lead at a time of national crisis. They leave cabinet meetings on Brexit with no idea of what will happen next because the inscrutable May keeps her cards nailed to her chest.After two crushing Commons defeats for her agreement in January and March, May had the humiliation of pleading with the EU to extend the UK’s membership beyond today’s original exit date. By now she knew her legacy would not only be as the “Brexit prime minister” but possibly as the one who failed even to deliver Brexit.The pressure was inevitably taking its toll. In another catastrophic error, May made a televised address to the nation in which she blamed the deadlock on parliament, insulting and offending the very MPs – particularly on the Labour side – whose votes she so desperately needed. In that moment, the die was probably cast.May thought she had one last roll, even though it meant giving up hope of forging a post-Brexit domestic agenda. In an attempt to hold her factious party together, she sacrificed her other central objective – her own survival – by promising to quit if her MPs gave her a majority for her deal.But with her focus on the Tories, she made yet another miscalculation: Labour MPs representing Leave areas, already furious at her attack on parliament for doing its job, now feared her departure would see a hardline Brexiteer succeed her, making them even less likely to carry her deal over the line.\u0026nbspDespite May’s efforts to woo them, only five Labour MPs backed her in today’s Commons vote.After a third defeat for her withdrawal agreement\u0026nbsp– albeit by a less margin – the game may be up.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The service is\u0026nbsppart of £108m of additional freight that is supposed to prevent chaos at Britain’s ports and secure\u0026nbspthe supply of vital goods such as medicines and\u0026nbsporgans for transplants.The government has no use for the space for at least another two weeks because Brexit has been delayed. But Brittany Ferries said it was too late to cancel the 20 extra crossings it will be running each week so space is being sold on the open market.Brittany Ferries altered the travel plans of more than 20,000 passengers with existing bookings when it changed its schedules in January.As part of its contingency planning the Department for Transport also awarded a £14m contract to Seaborne Freight and a £43m contract to Danish shipping firm DFDS. The department terminated its agreement with Seaborne when it became clear that it could not provide the service required. The company had no ships and no financial track record.The government also had to shell out an additional £33m to settle legal action brought by Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel over the DfT’s “secretive and flawed” procurement process. A further £800,000 was spent on consultants who assessed the deals.Brittany said it had incurred extra costs stemming from the contract, including more fuel and higher port fees.“Fifty additional Brittany Ferries’ port staff have been hired on both sides of the Channel to deal with more frequent port calls,” a Brittany spokesperson said.\u0026nbsp“We have also spent the last three months training current onboard teams.“The reality is that we were committed as soon as we signed the contract and preparations began to deliver the dedicated NHS shipment channel. There is no turning back at this late stage because all the preparatory work is now in place for 29 March.”Ramsgate in Kent where Seaborne Freight was to have run its no-deal Brexit ferry service from (AFPGetty)Brittany said it was using its “best endeavours” to re-sell unused capacity\u0026nbspto reduce costs to the taxpayer.\u0026nbspA government spokeswoman said it was “only right that we push on with contingency measures”.She added: “The government’s freight capacity contracts run for six months and are a vital part of wider contingency planning. They provide capacity for critical goods, including vital medicines, to continue to enter the UK in a no-deal scenario.“Due to the agreed extension until 12 April, tickets for the first two weeks have been released for sale on the open market, which will minimise costs for the taxpayer.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The strange rules are said to be enforced by the company\u0027s 73-year-old owner, who is rumoured to enter the pubs undercover to check that they are being kept to.The phone rule enforces a wide-ranging ban on phones and tablets, as well as including particular bans on pictures of sport and music apps.The brewery\u0027s policy is not to allow customers to use mobile phones, laptops or similar inside our pubs, reads the memo, which was first reported by the Manchester Evening News.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

One manager said the rule was being loosely enforced for now, but that it might become stricter as time goes on.Staff working at other pubs said they were yet to hear about the rule.Calls to Samuel Smith\u0027s central office were unanswered.One pub manager said that while it can be detrimental to have people on the phone, any restriction\u0026nbspshould be informal and policed by the iniduals themselves rather than being a strict rule.It’s a intrinsic part of modern society and that may be an issue but it’s not one for Sam Smiths to solve, said Heather Griffin, who manages the Rutland Arms in Sheffield, which is not a Sam Smiths pub.\u0026nbspIf they’re as hard line about it as they are with swearing that unfair cause people need their phones in certain situations and having it makes people feel more comfortable.I just think it comes across as quite pretentious – like they think they are somehow better than people who enjoy to use their phones for whatever use they want.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The singer, who was already a member of the hall through Fleetwood Mac, became the first woman to receive the honour twice.Styles introduced Nicks during the event and was photographed kneeling in front of the singer onstage.Nicks praised the 25-year-old Styles while speaking to the press, commanding him for building a solo career in addition to his work as a member of One Direction.“What I really loved about Harry was that when he decided to make a solo record from NSYNC,” she said, before catching herself and adding: “Sorry, not NSYNC.”Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 421 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.521 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1321 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1421 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1721 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2121 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in.

She sees all the romance and drama in the world and she celebrates it.”Nicks kicked off the night with a performance of some of her biggest hits, such as “Stand Back” and “Edge of Seventeen”.Styles filled in for the late Tom Petty to perform “Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around”.Additional reporting by agenciesRock and Roll Hall of FameThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Western lowland gorilla Kera, opens presents intended for her daughter Afia, in celebration of  her third birthday at Bristol Zoo Gardens“Mother’s Day should be a time of celebration for mums, but today many will instead be struggling to make ends meet. Labour will end the benefit freeze and make tackling child poverty the priority it should be once again.”Benefits – including tax credits, universal credit, child benefit\u0026nbspand jobseeker’s allowance – generally rise every year in line with inflation. However, as part of ongoing austerity measures, they have been frozen since 2016, leading to a decline in their real term value while inflation rises.In April 2016, the Conservative Party froze most working age benefits for four years – including jobseeker’s allowance, employment and support allowance, income support, housing benefit, universal credit, child tax credits, working tax credits and child benefit.According to the analysis, the benefit freeze means that a lone parent who is not in employment with one child is around £900 a year worse off and a parent with two children is just over £1,200 a year worse off, whether in the legacy system or the universal credit system.It found a lone parent in employment with one child is £810 worse off in the legacy system and £895 worse off in the universal credit system. While a lone parent with two children who is in employment is nearly £1,000 worse off in the legacy system and £1,200 worse off in the universal credit system.The rollout of universal credit has been plagued by controversy, with warnings people are being pushed into debt, rent arrears and reliance on food banks due to delays in payments.New government data published on Thursday showed 14 million people in the UK are living in absolute poverty. This includes 3.7 million children – 200,000 more than last year.\u0026nbspMore than a third of single mothers in debt, research findsHelen Barnard, deputy director of policy and partnerships at the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “It goes against what we stand for as a country to see so many lone-parent families locked in poverty.“Currently, there is a lone-parent penalty, which means nearly half of children in lone-parent families live in poverty compared with one in four of those in couple families. Lone parents are also twice as likely to be locked in persistent poverty, and living in poverty for long periods of time is particularly damaging.“We have consistently failed to tackle the issues holding families back from a decent life. As the sole earners, lone parents are being hit particularly hard by the high cost of living and cuts to social security. This is unacceptable and the government must right this wrong by ending the benefits freeze before the final year kicks in on 8 April 2019.”Government taken to court after single mother forced into homelessnessAlison Garnham, the chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, argued the rhetoric against lone parents had gone but the policies that are currently playing out effectively single them out for a greater risk of impoverishment.\u0026nbsp“To have almost half of lone parents’\u0026nbspchildren in poverty is unacceptable in a society that believes that every child deserves support,” she said.Ms\u0026nbspGarnham added: “Lone parents have been hit particularly hard by cuts to universal credit – with big losses of on average £2,380 per year, affecting their gains from work. Some 68 per cent of lone parents are working but as the annual poverty statistics published yesterday show, 47 per cent of their children are living under the poverty line.” \u0026nbspShe said their research with Loughborough university shows a\u0026nbsplone parent working full-time on the “national living wage” is now 20 per cent (£74 per week) short of what they need to achieve a socially acceptable minimum standard of living, as defined by the public.The Department for Work and Pensions has been contacted\u0026nbspfor comment.We’ll tell you what’s true.

She tweeted that Mr Juncker had told the Italian interviewer he would “like that the UK tells us which way they want to follow now”.It comes ahead of a series of key votes in Parliament on Monday which could pave the way for a “softer” Brexit.Several Tory ministers have urged Theresa May to heed the will of MPs if they manage to unite around a customs union during the second round of “indicative votes”.On Sunday cabinet minister David Gauke told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “If parliament is voting overwhelmingly against leaving the European Union without a deal but is voting in favour of a softer Brexit, then I don’t think it’s sustainable to ignore parliament’s position and therefore leave without a deal.”Defence minister Tobias Ellwood also signalled he would support some kind of customs union plan in the votes tomorrow.Although there has been speculation a general election could be called to break the deadlock in parliament, most Conservatives are opposed.Alistair Burt, who resigned as foreign office minister after voting against Ms May’s Brexit deal, said he didn\u0027t think a new election would be helpful.“We need to stick to this task that we have in relation to the European Union,” he told Sky News on Sunday. “Settle that and then move forward, offer the public the wide range of choices that political parties do ... let\u0027s get on with doing this job in the first place.”Additional reporting by ReutersWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The party’s founder Ian Paisley felt the European Union was part of a conspiracy to create a Catholic superstate controlled by the Vatican, once even claiming that seat number 666 at the European parliament was reserved for the Antichrist.The party went on to enjoy the best of both worlds, remaining deeply critical of the EU\u0026nbspwhile taking seats in its parliament – and welcoming the money it directs to Northern Ireland. EU support for Northern Ireland, particularly after the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, plays a key role in peacekeeping and economic prosperity.But the DUP has a very conservative, imperialist vision for\u0026nbspBritain, free from the reins of Europe, and dominant on the world stage as a solo entity. This is the common ground it\u0026nbspshares with the Conservative European Research Group, and even Ukip. So, when the referendum on EU membership came up in 2016, the party’s leaders attempted to have their cake and eat it: they would get behind this nationalist campaign for Brexit, safe in the knowledge that it would probably never happen. Except\u0026nbspit did.Worse news for the DUP was that Northern Ireland voted against Brexit, by 56 per cent to 44. Clearly going against the wishes of its\u0026nbspelectorate, the DUP instead emphasised that this was a nationwide vote and it was the overall vote that should be respected. Then the 2017 general election threw the party a lifeline: suddenly it was the\u0026nbspkingmaker\u0026nbspupon whom Theresa May relied. Its leaders boasted that they could now play a key role in defining the course of Brexit.\u0026nbspBut by December that year, it became clear that the DUP’s decisive role in Brexit would not be one Theresa May (and the majority of her party) would find helpful. Despite welcoming the prime minister’s commitment to no border on the island of Ireland, the DUP – led by Arlene Foster – was not pleased with the method through which this was guaranteed: the backstop.DUP would rather cancel Brexit than risk break up of UK - DoddsThe backstop ensures that, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, regulatory alignment with the bloc will continue across the island of Ireland. This avoids the border no one wants, but it also effectively leaves Northern Ireland under some EU rules, with checks on goods in the Irish Sea rather than between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\u0026nbspTo the DUP, this goes right to the heart of the constitutional question underpinning its entire existence. The party’s\u0026nbspraison d’etre is Northern Ireland’s continuing union with Britain, so seeing Northern Ireland treated differently is something it\u0026nbspsimply could not countenance. Some members even see this as a ploy by the EU and the Republic of Ireland to bring about a united Ireland by stealth.Fifteen months on from the birth of the backstop, much has happened in the Brexit saga. As a no-deal exit becomes a worrying reality to people on the ground in Northern Ireland, they have become increasingly at odds with the rationale of the DUP. A poll by The  this month found that 67 per cent of people there want to remain in the single market and the customs union to avoid any checks, while 59 per cent support remaining in the EU altogether. But for the DUP nothing has changed.The party is standing firmly by its most loyal grassroots, who would happily see a no deal, and probably wouldn’t baulk at a return of the border either.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

The party\u0026nbspnow sees itself as the sole protector\u0026nbspof the union – something which, despite the pressure it is under, will only strengthen its\u0026nbspresolve. The DUP would now rather have a long delay – or perhaps even no Brexit at all – than accept a deal that diminishes the strength of the union.Anyone expecting the DUP to be swayed at the last minute might want to review its firm opposition to the Sunningdale Agreement in 1973, the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, and indeed its obstinacy in the face of political compromise which has left Northern Ireland without a functioning government for the last two years. When it comes to this Brexit deal, the DUP will stay true to one of the most memorable refrains of Ulster unionism: “No surrender.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This option secured the backing of the highest number of MPs during the indicative votes on Wednesday.Downing Street has made it clear that Ms May will bring her Brexit deal back to the Commons for last-ditch attempt, despite her third attempt ending in humiliation on Friday.But with little hope of winning over\u0026nbspcore Brexiteers or the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Ms May now faces calls to either leave without a deal, call an election or unite MPs behind a much softer exit.Justice Secretary Mr Gauke said Ms May must consider a plan by veteran Tory Ken Clarke for a customs union – which came closest to securing a majority in the last ballot.“I think she would need to look very closely at that,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.“If parliament is voting overwhelmingly against leaving the European Union without a deal but is voting in favour of a softer Brexit, then I don’t think it’s sustainable to ignore parliament’s position and therefore leave without a deal.”Mr Gauke said Brexit had become a “national crisis” and warned Tory MPs that they may have to accept a “second or third choice” as the party does not have the numbers to push its manifesto pledges through parliament.How can the DUP support Brexit when Northern Ireland does not?Food industry chief ‘terrified’ of no-deal Brexit prospectTom Watson says new referendum ‘only way’ to unite countryTheresa May warned against snap general election by senior ToriesEU will delay Brexit to allow another referendumMr Gauke also restated his commitment to resign if the prime minister pursued a no-deal Brexit.Defence minister Tobias Ellwood also signalled he would support some kind of customs union plan in the votes tomorrow.He told BBC Radio 4’s The\u0026nbspWorld This Weekend: “Realistically, the Oliver Letwin machine comes back into play on Monday and that will probably tilt towards a customs arrangement or customs union support.”Mr Ellwood went on: “I agree with supporting the PM but in the absence of the PM’s deal not getting through and if you want to honour the referendum result, then yes I would be supporting something along those lines.”Five ministers voted for the customs union option last week. Cabinet ministers were ordered to abstain but big-hitters such as Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd are understood to be sympathetic to it.No 10 hopes that pressure will lead to more Brexiteers reluctantly backing Ms May’s deal after it cut the majority against it from 230 and 149 in the first two votes to 58 on Friday.Theresa May must give the people a Final Say on the deal nowBut Eurosceptic Tories delivered a show of force, signing a letter organised by Commons leader Andrea Leadsom to demand the UK leaves the EU before the end of May, even if no deal is signed.A source involved told The Independent: “The letter reaffirmed our commitment to the manifesto and to the PM’s own determination to seek a short extension to Article 50 that avoids the EU elections.”Elsewhere, efforts to secure a Final Say vote were bolstered by the suggestion another handful of Tories could back it, including former ministers Richard Harrington and Steve Brine, who both resigned last week.Sources say several Labour MPs who voted against the proposal last week are also saying they are ready to back this new compromise.Joanna Cherry, the SNP MP behind a revised plan to cancel Brexit if a no-deal scenario seems inevitable, said she had been approached by “many” Labour MPs who want to back it.MPs will hold a debate on revoking Article 50 on Monday, after the record-breaking petition hit 6\u0026nbspmillion signatures on Sunday.Senior Tories have warned Ms May against calling a snap election, amid fears that the bitterly ided party would be wiped out at the ballot box.Deputy chair\u0026nbspJames Cleverly said the party was engaged in “sensible and pragmatic” planning for a snap election but added his voice to a chorus of senior figures pleading with Ms May not to trigger one.Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry signalled Labour could also try to trigger an election by mounting a fresh vote of confidence in the government – but she could not say when the challenge would take place.A new Deltapoll survey for The Mail on Sunday shows Labour on 41 points, five points ahead of the Tories on 36. The same pollster gave the Conservatives a seven-point lead last month.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Ms May has also repeatedly rejected the idea.Mr Gauke\u0026nbspsaid: “I think we also have to recognise that my party does not have the votes to get its manifesto position through the House of Commons at the moment.“I think the prime minister’s deal does reflect the manifesto position but we, as you say, have been defeated three times.“So we do then need to come back and use our judgement as to what is the best way forward.“Consider what the options are and I do think we’re in an environment where it’s not about just\u0026nbspgoing for your first choice, sometimes you do have to accept your second or third choice in order to avoid an outcome that you consider to be even worse and MPs are entitled to use their judgement as to what the real choices are available for us as a country and come to what they consider to be the best conclusion.”Mr Gauke\u0026nbsprestated his opposition to a no-deal exit, saying he could no longer remain part of a government that pursued such a strategy.His comments set him at odds with many on the Brexiteer wing, with some 170 Tories, including several cabinet ministers\u0026nbspwriting to the prime\u0026nbspminister to urge her to take the UK out of the EU as soon as possible.Conservative Party deputy chairman James Cleverly insisted\u0026nbspthe party was not gearing up for a snap general election to resolve the Brexit deadlock but admitted it was doing some “sensible and pragmatic” planning.Brexit: Food chief ‘terrified’ of no-deal prospectTom Watson says new referendum ‘only way’ to unite countryTheresa May warned against snap general election by senior ToriesTory MPs pile pressure on Theresa May to pursue no-deal BrexitDUP would rather cancel Brexit than risk breakup of UK – Dodds“I don’t think an election would solve anything.

He said that Facebook had already made significant changes around political advertising.Facebook bans white nationalists in abrupt policy turnaroundWith the European Union elections due to take place in May, Facebook\u0026nbsphas already said any advertisers in the EU will undergo tighter checks amid fears of foreign interference.On Friday, the site also\u0026nbspstarted to label political adverts appearing in EU countries to show\u0026nbspwho the advertiser is, how much they paid and who they have targeted.However, in his op-ed, Mr Zuckerberg said that deciding whether an ad was political was not always straightforward.“Our systems would be more effective if regulation created common standards for verifying political actors,” he wrote.“Online political advertising laws primarily focus on candidates and elections, rather than isive political issues where we’ve seen more attempted interference.“Some laws only apply during elections, although information campaigns are nonstop. And there are also important questions about how political campaigns use data and targeting.“We believe legislation should be updated to reflect the reality of the threats and set standards for the whole industry.”\u0026nbspAnti-vaccine posts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter could be banned Facebook removes more Russian accounts over ‘inauthentic behaviour’Facebook admits storing millions of user passwords in plain text filesOn the subject of harmful content,\u0026nbspMr Zuckerberg said that Facebook was creating an independent body so people could appeal against its decisions\u0026nbspover what was posted and what was taken down.“It’s impossible to remove all harmful content from the internet, but when people use dozens of different sharing services — all with their own policies and processes — we need a more standardised approach,” he wrote.\u0026nbspMr Zuckerberg said Facebook already published\u0026nbsptransparency reports on how effectively it was removing harmful content,\u0026nbspand said he believed\u0026nbspevery major internet service should do this quarterly.In the wake of the Christchurch shootings, Facebook has\u0026nbspalready\u0026nbsppromised to explore\u0026nbsprestrictions on live-streaming and has said it will ban white nationalism and separatism on the site from next week.\u0026nbspIn terms of data protection and privacy, Mr Zuckerberg said a\u0026nbspglobally harmonised framework\u0026nbspwas required.\u0026nbsp“I believe it would be good for the Internet if more countries adopted regulation such as GDPR as a common framework,” he wrote.\u0026nbspOn data portability, Mr Zuckerberg wrote: “If you share data with one service, you should be able to move it to another. This gives people choice and enables developers to innovate and compete.”He said this would require\u0026nbspclear rules about who was responsible for protecting information when it moved\u0026nbspbetween services.Mr Zuckerberg appealed to governments\u0026nbsparound the world to develop rules\u0026nbspto regulate the internet. “I believe Facebook has a responsibility to help address these issues, and I’m looking forward to discussing them with lawmakers around the world,” he wrote.\u0026nbspAdditional reporting by PAWe’ll tell you what’s true.

And I will.”Mr Biden, 76, has said he has “95 per cent” decided he will contest for the Democratic presidential nomination for 2020, and some reports suggest he will formally announce some time in April. If he does run, it would be his third attempt.An average of polls collated by Real Clear Politics puts Mr Biden a clear eight points ahead of his nearest Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, who in turn is eleven points clear of Kamala Harris. Beto O’Rourke is in fourth position, and Elizabeth Warren is in fifth.Created with Sketch.Who could be running against Trump in 2020?

The event was being held for him to endorse her Democratic candidacy.\u0026nbspIn an article published in The Cut, Ms Flores said: “I was mortified. I thought to myself, ‘I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual f***? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?”This is not the first time Mr Biden faced criticism over seminally awkward or inappropriate interactions with women in public.In 2015, the Washington Post’s comedy writer Alexandra Petri wrote an article titled “What are we going to do about Creepy Uncle Joe Biden?”. The name has stuck.Biden: ‘Our leadership is giving license to this prejudice’Speaking to CNN, Ms Flores has stood by her accusation.“What I am saying is that it’s completely inappropriate, that it does not belong in any kind of a professional setting, much less in politics,” she said. “The reason why we’re having these conversations about vice president Joe Biden is because he’s considering running for president.”Also on Sunday, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, took an opportunity to attack Mr Biden. In an interview on Fox News, Ms Conway said Ms Flores, was “very bold to come forward” against someone in her own political party and wondered why Mr Biden had not apologised to her.Mr Biden also faces questions about his age and his questionable record on race relations.While commentators say some African Americans – especially older ones – could back his candidacy because of the support he provided to Barack Obama’s presidency, they also point to his support of the controversial 1994 crime bill that discriminated against minority communities, and his disrespectful questioning of Anita Hill when she testified against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.Woman says Joe Biden kissed her without consent in ‘awkward’ meetingJoe Biden says he ‘regrets’ his role in Anita Hill hearings Why Biden would love to declare with Stacey Abrams as his running mateJoe Biden should run as VP with Stacey Abrams leading the ticketBernie and Biden tied for frontrunner in new pollJoe Biden is not a meme — this is the truth about his voting recordIn recent weeks, Mr Biden met with Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost her bid to win the governorship of Georgia last year.\u0026nbspReports have suggested\u0026nbspMr Biden’s advisers have been considering the option of him announcing with a declared running mate, and that they would love Ms Abrams, an African American and a rising star within the party, to be on the ticket with him.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Mr Kocner denies any wrongdoing.The killings ignited the biggest protests in Slovakia\u0027s post-communist history and forced the resignation of Smer leader Robert Fico as prime minister last year.Ms Caputova had waged a 14-year fight with a company Mr Kocner represented that wanted to build an illegal landfill in her home town. She eventually won the case, earning her the nickname Slovakia\u0027s Erin Brockovich after the American environmentalist portrayed by Julia Roberts in a 2000 film.Ms Caputova\u0027s victory complicates Mr Fico\u0027s plan to leave politics by becoming head of the Constitutional Court – a position vetted by the president.It may give a boost to opposition parties looking to replace Smer, still the most popular party, in next year\u0027s general election.Far-right party crushed in Slovakia electionsPopulists set to win enough seats to \u0027paralyse\u0027 EUGlobal elites face populist assault as they gather for Davos 2019EU hits back at Italy populists over Genoa bridge collapseThe right-wing populists doing well across Europe But political analysts have said a socially liberal president will also mobilise Smer and anti-system voters, a fight already foreshadowed by Mr Fico this week when he referred to liberals as people without values.Mr Fico\u0027s Smer is a social democrat party but has also taken socially conservative positions. A row with the president could make Mr Fico push the country closer to eurosceptic and socially conservative leaders in neighbouring Hungary and Poland.There was an indication of that this week when Smer teamed up with the centre-right Slovak National party, the far-right People\u0027s Party-Our Slovakia and the populist We Are Family movement to halt ratification of a European treaty designed to combat violence against women.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Before that we may have to endure another vote on this same deal next week.Today should have been our first day of independence from the EU since . Instead it is now possible, probable even, that Brexit will never happen.Instead of being out, MPs have contrived to put Britain’s fate in EU hands. Three years after voting to leave we face the global humiliation of having to field new candidates in Brussels elections.That is down to the abject failure and contemptible dishonesty of the worst crop of politicians of our letimes.Given a clear choice by Theresa May, to guarantee Brexit or continue to oppose and jeopardise it,  chose the latter.And the lion’s share of blame falls to Corbyn’s liars. Ever since the referendum of June , , Labour have ­pretended they respect the result. When it came to the crunch they refused.Why  To appease Remainers. And because unleashing mayhem on the Tories is far more important to them than worried workers and families, or businesses paralysed by uncertainty.With Labour, party always trumps country. And their Marxist revolution can only arise from the ashes of chaos.Labour had no reason to defeat the Withdrawal Agreement. It commits to everything they wanted. Even their own “plan” is based on it. So they concocted an excuse about it being a “blind Brexit” which fails to nail down our future.Yet these same people are willing on political anarchy. They back a “people’s vote” without a clue what the question would be or what disorder it might unleash. So much for “blind” options.We hope Leave voters are watching.They were not betrayed by the Tories. This minority Government, outnumbered by Remainers, at least made a deal to ensure Brexit happened.No . . . Corbyn and his acolytes have stopped Brexit and almost certainly triggered a delay long enough to overturn the Leave vote.As for the others, the Tory Remain diehards are beyond hope. So, it now seems, are the ERG purists still unable to see the freight train thundering down the tracks.They think they are honouring .million votes. But their ridiculous protest against their own Government risks overturning every one. If Brexit is destroyed, they will not escape blame.Nor will the DUP “hardliners” now apparently seeking the softest possible Brexit. What flimsy allies they proved.And let’s not forget Speaker Bercow, the embodiment of the stinking decay at the heart of this Parliament, twisting rules to get the second referendum he craves. A man who scuppered a Labour backbench amendment he knew could help the Government secure Brexit.Our future is now uncertain. MPs may back a permanent EU customs union on Monday. How can a Tory leader enact a move to destroy Brexit’s economic case Or preside over a second referendum If, then, there’s an election, who knows who would win  Or even what policies either main party would stand on But at least we could all chuck out these cynical, dishonest, game-playing charlatans.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It remains unlikely that the EU will force a No Deal outcome on the UK.But any extension they offer the UK is going to involve this country taking part in the European Elections.On Monday, MPs will vote again on ious Brexit options. Last time, none of the eight options got a majority. But there is a chance that this time something will.The options that might get a majority, though, would go directly against what the Tories said in their election manesto.Could a Government really seek to negotiate something that was directly contradictory to its manesto  This is the question preoccupying Cabinet ministers this weekend.If something does get a majority, Mrs May might choose to ask the House to choose between it and her deal.But the most obvious alternative to it would be a GENERAL ELECTION.If a customs union is what wins on Monday, the call is the most finely balanced.Negotiating one would, in the words of a Cabinet minister, “be an enormous breach” of the Tory manesto. But fighting a whole Election on a customs union would be hard,not impossible.“You might want it to be a single-issue Election,” this Cabinet minister admits. “But it is going to cover a multitude of sins.”For this reason, he concludes that a “surprisingly small number of Cabinet members would have the courage to say, ‘go for an Election’.”Butany of the other options wins, it is simpler for the Tories. Opposing a second referendum or single market membership — which would leave the UK as a rule taker and not end free movement — are clear electoral positions. Yesterday’s vote on the Withdrawal Agreement allows the Tories to attack Labour MPs in Leave-supporting seats for blocking Brexit, on Brexit Day.There is, though, a huge problem for the Tories with an Election: WHO WOULD LEAD THEM INTO IT Mrs May’s commitment was to step downher deal passed. But despite this, her fighting an Election when she has promised to go as soon as the deal is through would risk looking absurd.Voters would, understandably, ask who the Tories were planning to have as PM for the rest of the Parliament, and what their plans were for taxes and public services, as well as Brexit.This means the Tories would have to have a rapid leadership contest and the winner would then have to take them straight into the Election. There are problems with this. The victor would have little time to reunite the party, develop a domestic agenda and introduce themselves to the country before hitting the campaign trail.But things wouldn’t be easy for Labour, either. It would have to have a clear Brexit position. Does it want a second referendum or a softer Brexit What is clear is that the uncertainty holding this country back needs to end.If it hadn’t been for the constitutional meddling of the coalition government, there would be a clear answer to this problem: Mrs May would have made the vote on her deal a confidence vote, meaning a General Electionit was defeated. This would probably have got the deal through.But it is now becoming increasingly hard to see how this logjam can be broken without a General Election.THE Tory party doesn’t yet know what kind of leader it needs. If it is going to be pitched into an early election, as looks increasingly likely, it needs a very dferent kind of leader to what is requiredthis Parliament is going to .The problem for the Tories in this contest is – as one of the few Cabinet ministers with no leadership ambitions points out – they are trying to answer three very dferent questions.WHO would negotiate the best future relationship with the EU WHO can give the Tories back a sense of domestic policy purpose And WHO is best placed to sell Toryism to a new generation The answer to these questions is not the same. That’s why there is so much talk of dream tickets. Which of Boris Johnson or Michael Gove will win Amber Rudd’s endorsement And will Penny Mordaunt take the No slot on Jeremy Hunt’s ticket Organisation is key to winning Tory leadership elections and one minister who is being courted by several campaigns tells me the “only people who have got good parliamentary operations are Hunt andRaab”.Sajid Javid, the former frontrunner, is still losing momentum. But his chance comes from the fact that all the other candidates are flawed too.And MPs might be prepared to give him a second look once they have kicked the tyres on the other options. Javid, the son of a first-generation Pakistani immigrant bus driver, has a story to tell.There is, though, an increasing sense among Tory MPs that there is a case for going for someone outside the current Cabinet, who isn’t tainted by the current mess.Given the scale of the challenge facing the country, it would be hard to skip a generation to a Johnny Mercer or a James Cleverly, or any other member of the  intake.But until the Tories know whether this will be a flat race or a steeplechase, they are unlikely to choose a horse to back.WITHOUT the DUP, it is pretty much impossible for Theresa May to pass her Brexit deal.But her problem is they are moving towards the view that a softer Brexit is better for them.I am told they are worried about the PM going and a new leader coming in and opting for an early election.One of those who has been trying to persuade them to back the deal tells me: “They have a massive issue with all the other candidates. They’ve worked out the ERG are not fanatical Unionists.”But any Tory PM is likely to pick a general election over a soft Brexit.A rapid General Election wouldn’t suit the DUP, as it could result in them no longer holding the balance of power in Parliament.THE delay to Brexit is bad enough. A second referendum, before the result of the first has even been implemented, would add insult to injury.Yet that is expected to be one of the options Parliament votes on come Monday: A customs union with a confirmatory referendum.With the Cabinet abstaining, only  per cent of Tory MPs backed a customs union. That is less than the number of Tory MPs you need to trigger a leadership contest.It is a sign that, as one senior party figure tells me: “You cannot have a soft Brexit and an intact Conservative Party.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government took a conscious decision and the Chancellor was very explicit that he was not prepared to spend money in making those preparations.That was a disastrous decision. I think,we had done that, then the position today would look very dferent.My preference would be to go back to Europe and say we have a clear strategy — to leave without a deal but to take six months or so to complete the preparations.Then we would be in a much stronger position.If we were to leave without making adequate preparations there would be some short-run dislocation cost. It is hard to know how serious that would be but I think the view that somehow we will have queues of lorries on the M for five years or more is absurd.The important thing is, that, with adequate preparations, I do not believe the long-term economic costs of leaving would be very dferent from staying in the European Union.But the issue should not be just about economics.One of the sad things about this whole debate is that the country has become deeply ided.People on both sides are passionate about it but they are not passionate because they have views about the economic effects.I have not met anyone who said, “I’d be in favour of BrexitI thought the impact on GDP will be less than two per cent but I’ll be in favour of RemainI thought it would be more than five per cent”.It is the issues of identity and culture and politics that are motivating people, which is why I think MPs have somehow lost the plot.When people say the consequence of leaving without a deal is national suicide, I despair.

GDP in Italy is no higher today than it was  years ago when it joined the monetary union.These are dreadful outcomes for the monetary union. Do we really want to be in a club that accepts such outcomes Of course, some people want to be in a federal Europe. It’s a reasonable point of view, though not one I subscribe to.But that is what we should be debating not exaggerating the economic consequences of the alternatives.I do not think it is obvious that jobs in Britain would be lostwe left the EU.Look at what has happened since the vote to leave when we were told there would be a recession.Since mid- our economy has grown by slightly more than Germany’s.The idea that voting for leave has been an economic disaster does not match facts.One of the things that many people find surprising is that the average value of sterling against other currencies is exactly the same this week as it was the day I left the Bank of England nearly six years ago. Financial markets have not panicked and businesses have carried on.We should all be more confident in our country and our future prosperity.Forget the scare stories and focus on the question: Do you, or do you not, want to be in the political club that is the European Union Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Is that really less damaging than a clean break, as we’re so often told Inside the single market, our laws stay under European Court of Justice jurisdiction.We still make big annual payments to Brussels and retain “freedom of movement rules. Calling that “Brexit” makes a mockery of the  referendum result.The economic benefits of the single market are, anyway, wildly overstated. All UK firms, including the  per cent that don’t export to the EU, must comply with the expensive EU rules.The single market in services barely exists — severely penalizing the UK, the world’s second-largest services exporter.We don’t need to be in the single market to trade with Europe. The US conducts hundreds of billions of dollars of EU trade every year. We can do the same.If the single market is so great, why is the UK’s trade with the EU shrinking and our non-EU trade expanding  Why do we trade more with the rest of the world The EU’s customs union is also wrongly presented as economic heaven. But it means the UK charges tarfs on imports from outside the EU. So British shoppers pay more for a range of imports, including food and clothing, to shield uncompetitive producers in other EU states.Some  per cent of these tarfs are then sent to Brussels — billions of pounds each year.The customs union also stops Britain striking trade deals with nations outside the EU — four-fths of the global economy.As the centre of economy gravity shts decisively east, it is vital that Britain engages more with the world’s fastest-growing and most populous markets.Nations acting alone have secured far more important trade deals, covering a much bigger share of the global economy. In , Switzerland struck a trade deal with China — so can we.The narrative that Soft Brexit — or no Brexit at all — makes economic sense has been shaped by the same establishment voices who told us, back in , that simply voting to leave the EU would spark “an immediate and profound economic shock”. They were wrong then and wrong now.A Clean Brexit, in contrast, outside the EU’s main legal constructs means Britain would thrive — precisely why Brussels doesn’t want it to happen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There are currently almost , empty nurse jobs in England.And a new report by think tanks the Nuffield Trust, the Health Foundation and The King’s Fund predicts this could rise to , within five years.In the meantime, it is unsurprising to hear that nine out of ten NHS nurses say staff shortages are affecting the quality of care they can give their patients.One major problem is that we take our nurses for granted. Many AE nurses in particular are subject to unacceptable levels of rudeness, abuse and even violence.Hospitals are increasingly being run by non-medical staff who are mostly driven by targets and not quality of care. And more nurses are having to sit filling out paperwork rather than actually nursing.We also don’t pay nurses enough. You can probably work in Tesco stacking shelves for the same money as some nurses are paid — and live a much less stressful le.All too often, it’s not until we find ourselves dependent on nurses doing a good job that we truly appreciate them and what they do for us.When my grandmother was very ill in hospital, pretty much the only good thing about her hospital experience was the nurses.They were kind, chatty, cared for her, spoke to her and treated her with dignity in a very grim situation.We need to start appreciating nurses before it’s too late. Then we need to put our money where our mouths are.Sure, nursing is a vocational job. But money still matters, especiallyyou are living in a big city.It costs £, a year to train as a nurse. Nurses who have served ten years with the NHS should be given that money back in what I would call a “legacy payment”.If that payment is given in their pension, it would cost the Government very little, but I am sure nurses would love it.Since , the Government has axed the bursaries for people who are studying nursing or midwery at university.The budget for helping staff to develop their skills in the workplace has also been cut to a third of its value of five years ago.We need to give more support to people who want to train and bring back the bursaries.The current pay structure means that some fantastic nurses are underpaid — and that some terrible nurses are overpaid.We need to smash the pay structure and let hospitals pay what they want to their nurses and not be confined by pay brackets, so that really good nurses are rewarded and bad nurses are not.That would make a big dference, because we all know how demoralising it is to work really hard and yet be paid the same as someone who doesn’t.Nursing involves long and unsociable hours. All too often it involves having dinner at breakfast time. Nurses need to be offered more financial reward for working night shts.How will this money be raised  For a start, the NHS needs to make efficiencies, such as central buying and not give out vanity boob jobs and other medically unnecessary procedures.It needs to start charging peoplethey miss a GP appointment without good cause, and there should be means testing for patients over the age of  before they get free prescriptions.The country is run by unsung heroes — police, doctors, teachers and nurses. They are the foundation of this country and we can’t live without them.The repercussions of continuing to treat nurses with the lack of respect that we currently show them will be many, ied and severe.Let’s not find that out the hard way.RESEARCH showing that attractive women bosses are considered less truthful and trustworthy by both sexes is so depressing.As well as thinking that a pretty female boss is less likely to be honest, apparently both men and women also think they are more deserving of being fired than a less attractive counterpart.The implication is that any woman who shatters the glass ceiling is perceived to have used underhand methods to get there.How sad.And how far away from all of our hope that we are judged on our work, not our looks.I’M a big believer that it’s not what happens to you in le that matters so much as how you respond to it.But sometimes things happen that would make most of us want to crawl into a hole and hide.I have maximum respect for Londoner Zoe Parsons, , who has managed to turn her experience of domestic violence into something truly positive.When she told her husband, Edson Peart, that she didn’t want to have sex with him, his response was to rape her violently on a regular basis.He told her: “I own you.”After she plucked up the courage to leave him – a hugely brave act in itself – Peart broke into her house and attacked her, leaving Zoe needing stitches.Justice has now been served and Peart has been sentenced to eight and a half years in prison.Zoe has trained as a le coach, helping other survivors of domestic violence – which affects one in four women and leads to two women being killed each week.Astonishingly, marital rape was only recognised as a criminal offence in .This story is a necessary reminder that some men still misguidedly think they “own” women – and that marriage makes a woman their own personal property.For a start, private companies can pay their bosses whatever they like, as the pay comes out of the shareholders’ profits.And what MPs fail to realise is that these bosses give  per cent of whatever they earn back to the country in tax.So actually we should all be thanking God for them and the contribution they make to society, rather than making them feel bad about the money they take home.MPs might not like it but, frankly, as they seem incapable of doing their jobs at the moment, they are in no position to moan about people who get paid a large salary for doing a job well.What happened to the aspiration in this country MOSES ETTIENNE was jailed this week for claiming nearly £, from the taxpayer , in accommodation and living expenses, after saying he was living in Grenfell Tower when the fire broke out, despite giving the authorities who approved his payout a non-existent flat address.How on earth is this possible, surely an address is something simple to check Quite rightly he was jailed for five years after taking money that was set aside to help those who really needed it. Scum of the earth.But spare a thought for those for whom it’s not.I’ll be spending a quiet day with my kids and my mum.I don’t want any fancy chocolates, gts, cards or presents.Just a cup of tea in bed and a cuddle from my two kids... who can’t get their heads around the fact I have a mummy as well.VERY pleased to see that trend predictor Marian Salzman, , says the “age proud” movement is on the rise in .“Gone are the days when women lied about these things,” she says. “If you don’t say your age you look dated.”I couldn’t agree more. In fact, I make a point of never lying about my age. I am  next month – and proud.Andpeople ever say that I don’t look my age, I say: “But this is what  looks like!”WHY, when anything good happens in this country, do some people just want to whine Yet critics carp that it should be eligible only for Best International Programme, as the series first aired in the US.Shut up!It’s a British production and well worth celebrating.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Across the country, those who voted Leave in  are taking note and,betrayed, will seek revenge.The Black Spot planted on Tory plotter Dominic Grieve by his constituents last week is just for starters.The real blowback will come at the next election whenever it takes place — unless Britain is no longer a member of the EU.Polls yesterday suggested Labour is five points ahead of the Tories and poised to form a minority Government.These figures are meaningless. The next election will be decided not by votes for or against the major parties, but on the candidates’ support for the referendum result.There are .million votes up for grabs. They will either support pro-Brexit candidates or stay home and sit on their hands. Either way, it will transform the poll.Labour votes will be mopped up in Leave seats by Nigel Farage’s new Brexit Party, what’s left of Ukip, or, in Remain seats, by Labour deserters now known as Change UK.The picture is dferent for the Tories, depending upon when any poll is held and what happens in the next few weeks.A snap election, apparently to be announced on Wednesday, would be suicidal. Anything led by Theresa May would be a bloodbath.Under a new pro-Brexit leader, with breathing space to regroup, it could be an opportunity to clear the air once and for all. Meanwhile, we face further Commons chaos, showdowns with Brussels, the possibility of fighting European elections in May — and the outside chance of “crashing out”.No Deal is no big deal, as ex-Bank of England Governor Mervyn King told The Sun last week — at least for Britain. We would swtly overcome a short, bumpy ride.Not so for Europe — and for all their bluster, EU states are beginning to fear it happening by accident.Germany is grimly aware it is about to lose the UK as a long-standing ally in the balance of European power with France and the EU’s hard-up southern states.Without our £billion-a-year contribution — one of the biggest by EU states — Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece will be queuing in Berlin for German cash.Unless a deal on frictionless trade is reached, German exporters will be hammered and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost in their manufacturing industry.Support for “populist” parties — including in Germany — has mushroomed since the UK voted Leave.Which explains this week’s dash to Dublin by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She wants preening Irish PM Leo Varadkar to stop playing games and solve the Irish backstop question.Either he bows to technological solutions to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland or there will be a hard border at Calais with Ireland on the wrong side.Merkel knows a solution to the backstop problem would persuade the DUP to support Mrs May’s Withdrawal Bill, and even push it over the line at the fourth time of asking.That, in turn, would be enough to persuade all but the most stubborn Tories to sign up and, along with a few extra Labour votes, bring this edition of the long-running Brexit soap to a close.As always with these negotiations, nothing is settled until everything is settled, always at the th hour. It is now .pm and ticking.Let’s hope the Irish Taioseach put his clocks forward yesterday.He needs results fast. In yet another bloody incident, four innocent civilians were kned at random in North London, apparently by the same man.

But actually, there are many things in le that will hit you harder and more immediately than whether and how we leave the EU. April is traditionally the time when a raft of new laws come into force changing your rights - and your wallet. This year is no exception with new rules for EU citizens, train toilets and knives, and the minimum wage and Universal Credit. We have rounded up  of the biggest changes coming into force in and around April  - read on to see how theyaposll hit you.    DATE: Saturday  March UK officials have now officially launched the process EU citizens must go through to remain in Britain after Brexit . Over the coming period of more than a year, more than .million EU citizens in the UK will have to use the EU Settlement Schemethey want to stay beyond June . EU citizens who have been in the UK for five years or more by  December  should apply for settled status now. People who have not lived in the UK for five years must apply for pre-settled status. This gives them the right to stay until they reach the five year mark. At that point, they must apply again for the right to stay. Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd infamously claimed it would be “as easy as setting up an online account at LK Bennett” - a posh shoe shop. But the scheme was hit by technical glitches on the first day it was fully launched. And campaigners claimed vulnerable people in rural areas like Cornwall could have to travel more than  miles to have their paperwork scanned. The Home Office has insisted several types of help are in place.    DATE: Sunday  March Thousands more police officers can now authorise enhanced aposstop and searchapos probe. Forces in badly-affected areas can now to activate the powers, designed to head off the kne crime crisis, at a lower level of seniority. Home Secretary Sajid Javid lted two restrictions in stop and search guidance, rolled out in  under Theresa May . The Best Use of Stop and Search Scheme, which all forces are signed up to, means police must first have an order signed off under Section  of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. The signing officer has to be at least of chief superintendent rank, and must reasonably believe serious violence will take place. Under the changes announced this weekend, which initially apply to seven forces, the rank at which a section  can be approved has been lowered to inspector. This will result in at least , more officers being able to authorise the use of the powers, officials estimate. The degree of certainty has also been lowered, so that the authorising officer must reasonably believe serious violence may occur. . aposCrack cocaine of gamblingapos stakes are being cut to £    DATE: Monday  April The maximum stake on highly addictive fixed odds betting terminalswill be cut from £ to just £ in a victory for campaigners. The Mirror has campaigned for new regulations to limit stakes on the machines, dubbed the “crack cocaine of gambling”. Tory MP Tracy Crouch, who resigned to fight for the stake to come in on April , tweeted: I just wanted to say thank you to all those who helped secure change, including the brave addicts who spoke out, campaigners, health professionals, parliamentary colleagues  DCMS officials. It was the right  responsible outcome. But Neil McArthur, chief executive of the Gambling Commission, said activists and betting firms must be vigilant to players taking up other forms of gambling instead. . Youaposll pay an inflation-busting hike in dentist fees    DATE: Monday  April Going to the dentist is still fairly cheap - compared to, say, private treatment or getting a train any further than a few miles. But the government has taken advantage of this to whack on an above-inflation, % hike on charges. A Band  treatment, including a standard check-up, will now cost £. . A Band  treatment, including fillings, root canal work or extractions, now costs £. . And a Band  treatment, including crowns, dentures, bridges and other laboratory work, now costs £. .    DATE: Monday  April April  is the deadline for toilets to go free at all major train stations run by Network Rail. Previously people had to spend up to p to spend a penny while waiting for a train at some city hubs. But last year it emerged toilet charges would be scrapped. Most have had charges stopped already, with the remaining ones expected to follow on April . At the time, Network Railaposs chief executive Mark Carne said it was wrong to penalise people when they are in discomfort. The change only applies to the biggest stations, which are run by Network Rail, and not stations run by inidual train firms. . The minimum wage for over-s is rising p an hour    DATE: Monday  April The aposNational living wageapos – the minimum wage for over-s by any other name - is going up on April . That means more money in the pockets of an estimated million workers. The rate is rising .% from £. to £. an hour for those aged  and over - worth £. a year to someone working a -hour week. Rates for younger workers rise too. They go up from £. to £. for people aged -, from £. to £. for the - age group, and from £. to £. for those aged -. You can read our full guide to the April minimum wage rises here .    DATE: Saturday  April Youaposll pay no income tax on the first £, of money you earn in the   tax year - up from £, previously. Thataposs an extra £ of tax free income compared with last year, saving people £ in tax. But the biggest benefit under the Tories is for Britainaposs richest earners. The threshold at which % tax kicks in is going up from £, to £, - saving the richest workers a much, much higher £ a year. . Youaposll have to pay more into a pension - but so will your firm  DATE: Saturday  April The minimum amount you must pay into a workplace pension is being hiked sharply from % of your salary to %. But every cloud has a silver lining, as employers will also have to pay more - with their contribution to your pot rising from % of your salary to %. It applies to all staff who are in an automatic enrolment pension scheme, and is designed to make workers more self-reliant in an increasingly ageing society. . More workers will have the legal right to a payslip  DATE: Saturday  April From the   tax year, new laws will force employers to provide standard details on all payslips. These include gross salary, net salary, itemised deductions and iable hours. Importantly, firms will now not only have to send payslips to employees but also anyone classed as a worker, which can include self-employed freelancers or contractors. . Universal Credit families get a leline worth up to £ a year    DATE: Monday  April The aposwork allowanceapos in Universal Credit - the amount you can earn before benefits are clawed back - is being raised by £, a year. The threshold will change from £ a month to £ for many claimants. Once you earn over that threshold, your UC is cut by p for every extra £ you earn. The huge U-turn announced at Novemberaposs Budget is worth up to £ a year for families, and is costing the Treasury £.billion a year. But it was also blasted as a sticking plaster over a gaping wound - as only families with dependent children and the disabled get work allowances. Childless couples - or those whose children have flown the nest - wonapost benefit from the rise. There were already more than , of these in December  and will be many hundreds of thousands more when UC is rolled out in full from next summer. . But another year of the benefit freeze will kick in  DATE: Monday  April From April , millions will enter the fourth year of the cruel benefit freeze - meaning it is now costing some families £, a year. The brutal real-terms cut was approved just days after MPs were told their salary will rise .% to almost £,.

Under the plans, commercial porn sites will be forced to show they are verying users are over  under the AgeID system. That could force users to submit ID details online, like a driveraposs licence or passport, or buy a voucher from a high street shop. The porn block has been repeatedly delayed while officials iron out the kinks. Ex-Culture Secretary Matt Hancock originally claimed it would be fully in place by April .

Labour could press for a vote of no-confidence in the Government as soon as this week, as a poll put it five points ahead of the Tories. It came as pressure increased from within the Prime Minister’s inner circle to call a general election and end the Brexit deadlock. Mr Corbyn told the Mirror: “We’re ready for a general election, whenever it comes. Labour has an alternative Brexit plan and we are ready to deliver it.” But he added: “An election must be about the future of our country, not just Brexit.” Vowing to “rebuild and transform Britain”, he said: “A general election would give us the chance to remove this incompetent and failed Tory government.    “Whether people voted Leave or Remain, they face problems of falling living standards, rising job insecurity and cuts to essential services across the country. Labour will bring people together.” Polling placed Labour on %, the Tories on %. If repeated at an election, it would leave just  Tory MPs, with  for Labour. Although that would leave Mr Corbyn  seats short of an overall majority, it would make him the best placed to form a Government. He said: “We take nothing for granted and understand the disappointment the public has with politics. “Butan election is called, it would be the chance to change politics in a fundamental way, take on the failed elite who have held back people and communities, and carry out a radical programme of change which truly benefits the many, not the few.”   The likelihood of Theresa May calling an election appeared to grow last week, after her deal was rejected for the third time.Top No aides, including media chief Robbie Gibb, were understood to be pressing Mrs May to call an election. Butshe fails to do so, Labour could trigger onethey win a vote of no-confidence. Their last bid in January failed by just  votes. Mr Corbyn would then have two weeks to form a government on his own, before an election is automatically triggered. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said the party was preparing for an imminent general election and European elections, in case of a further Brexit delay. He told the BBC yesterday: “I’ve spoken to Jeremy last night. He’s putting us on election footing.” In recent weeks Labour has been testing slogans and messaging for the campaign trail. Mr Corbyn will appear at a string of large public rallies. Party bosses have prepared a “grid” of which Shadow Cabinet member will go where and when through the six-week run-up to polling day. And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has been speaking to ministers on costings for plans in government.    And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has been speaking to ministers on costings for plans in government. Mr Watson said it was “inconceivable” a Labour manesto for a snap election would not include a second referendum. He said: “We need to move beyond Brexit ...the only way we can do that is with a People’s Vote.”Former Labour PM Tony Blair said the party faces defeat from Boris Johnson-led Tories unless it abandons Mr Corbyn’s “revolutionary” politics. His Tory predecessor John Major said only a government of national unity could break the deadlock. He said: “It would be in the national interest to have a cross-party government.” MPs will hold a second round of indicative votes tonight with no-deal, a second referendum and a customs union all set to be on the table. Mrs May was expected to try to bring her deal back for yet another vote tomorrow or Wednesday – despite it being rejected three times by MPs. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry lashed the “out of control” PM, telling Sky News: “Even with days to go she is saying ‘It’s my deal or no deal.’ That is not democracy.”  Senior ministers including Justice Secretary David Gauke, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and Business Secretary Greg Clark are set to resignMrs May chooses to pursue a no-deal exit. But a letter signed by  Tory MPs demanded Brexit soon, with or without a deal. Deputy Tory chairman James Cleverly said election planning was taking place.

The suggestion is made in a paper for the Policy Exchange think tank, drawn up by two constitutional experts and passed to Downing Street yesterday. It comes as MPs prepare to hold indicative votes on the way forward tomorrow that are expected to favour a softer Brexit - a UK-EU customs union. But that would contradict a key manesto pledge by the Tories in , and overturn months of promises by Theresa May. So in order to implement the decision, MPs are mulling passing an Act of Parliament and going over the governmentaposs head to do it. In the paper, lawyers Stephen Laws QC and Prof Richard Ekins argue Theresa May could stop the Bill at its final stage - being signed off by Her Majesty.  The process of Royal assent has become a formality, they write. Butlegislation would otherwise be passed by an abuse of constitutional process and principle facilitated by a rogue Speaker, the Government might plausibly decide to advise Her Majesty not to assent to the Bill in question. It would be MPs, not the Government, that had by unprincipled action involved the monarch. It would set up a constitutional crisis with the Queen, who is famously completely neutral on political matters in public.    Questioned on the shock claims today, Home Office minister Victoria Atkins did not rule out the government taking the so-called nuclear option. She told BBC Radio  Liveaposs Pienaaraposs Politics: I think every responsible minister and MP would be very very very loath to do that. “I would find it very dficult to see how that would come about.” It came as the Conservative Party erupted into open warfare over whether to bow to mounting pressure and back soft Brexit later this week.   The indicative votes are widely expected to single out a customs union - keeping close EU ties and favoured by Labour - as the most popular option after it won more support than any other last week.  Tory Cabinet minister David Gauke today warned Theresa May it would be unsustainable to ignore the will of MPsthey choose a customs union. But  Tory MPs wrote to the Prime Minister urging her to take the UK out of the EU quickly as possible - WITHOUT a customs union. The letter is said to be backed by  Cabinet ministers including Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Michael Gove and Penny Mordaunt.

Back then, Ken was a stockbroker, commuting into London each day, while Viv was a housewe and working in occasional part-time roles. ‘Right from the first child we fostered, we’ve never looked back,’ says Ken. ‘You don’t do it for the money – it’s a -hour-a-day job in a way, and it can be hard work. aposBut all children deserve a proper family.’ The couple are respite foster carers, meaning they often care for youngsters to give their usual foster home some time off.

Viv and Ken form lelong friendships with many of the children they foster, and several of them still refer to the couple as Nanny and Pop. ‘It’s lovely when they want to stay in touch and be part of the family,’ says Viv. ‘We get a lot of Christmas cards with sweet messages, and love to meet up with them whenever we can. aposOne boy even visits us from Norway.’    Their two daughters were so inspired by Viv and Ken’s kindness that they are both now foster carers themselves. ‘My daughter Gail fostered a tiny baby, something I’ve never done,’explains Viv. ‘She had him for two years, and when he was due to be adopted she just couldn’t cope with parting with him. aposSo she adopted him – and he’s now our lovely -year-old grandson!’ They also have four more biological grandkids, as well as the ious kids they are each fostering at one time – it makes Sunday lunch a busy affair. ‘We always make sure that the fostered kids are completely included in everything we do,’ says Ken. ‘They’re very much part of the family while they’re here. aposYou can’t put your le on hold, and I think the children really like to feel like they’re part of a regular family and not just a lodger. aposWe’ll even take them on holiday,we’re going.’ Treated badly A lot of the children have come from troubled homes and can have behavioural problems.  ‘We didn’t realise until we started doing this just how many kids have a terrible start,’ says Ken. ‘A lot of them haven’t been treated well at all, by parents who are criminals or drug addicts. We had one poor girl who had been raped by her father and brother, but the case had been dropped because there wasn’t enough evidence. In that situation all you can do is offer support and stability while they’re here.’  Barnardo’s, who Viv and Ken foster through, offer a -hour support line for carers. ‘We’ve never had to call them, because we’re a whole family of fosterers so we’ll just ring each other up and ask for advicewe need it,’ says Ken. ‘We’ve never had anyone that’s caused a big problem. aposThere was one boy who threw some bins about a bit and another who took some cash, but when you think what they’d been through, you could understand their behaviour.’ When a new child arrives, the couple lay down some firm house rules: things like not eating in the bedrooms, having a proper family meal at the table once a day, and not being on their phones too much. ‘The kids seem to like boundaries,’ says Viv.  ‘A lot of them haven’t had many at home, so they quite appreciate it when we put them in place here.’ It’s not just British kids from troubled homes that Viv and Ken have cared for over the years, there’s also been refugees from around the world who have received a warm welcome at their comfortable house. ‘We’ve had kids from Afghanistan, Syria, Eritrea and China, and always make sure we accommodate all their cultural dferences,’ says Viv. ‘If they want to go to the mosque, we’ll take them and we’ll make sure not to cook pork either. aposThey are normally quite easy to look after to a certain extent because they haven’t come from troubled families, they are trying to find a country of refuge away from war or famine. aposWe’re just helping them settle in.’ Making a dference Over the years, Viv and Ken have had the chance to make a real dference in the lives of many children.  Usually, a bit of kindness is enough to tame even the wilder ones. ‘We had one girl called Sarah who came to stay with us a few times,’ remembers Viv. ‘One day, when she was about  years old, Barnardo’s called me at am and said that she’d run away from her foster home and they were having a big problem calming her down – she was really fighting against the police. aposI said, “No problem, bring her here.” aposThey turned up with about six officers. aposI walked out and said, “Oh Sarah, what’s up with you ” and she walked inside like a lamb because she knew she was safe here.  aposI didn’t bombard her with questions, I just sat on her bed while she went off to sleep. aposShe stayed here for a couple of days and then went back to where she was living before.’ Viv and Ken also had the tough experience of having to let kids go who wanted to stay. ‘Now that we’re retired we like to go on our holidays, to places as far afield as India and Vietnam,’ says Viv. ‘One boy wanted to stay for another six months but we had some longer trips coming up so we had to say no.  aposThe little boy just kept saying, “Please, please, can’t you keep me here ” aposIt’s really heartbreaking when that happens but we had to send him off.  aposHe gave me a big hug and said, “I don’t want to go.” aposBut thankfully he went to a very nice home and we went to see him.’ Both Viv and Ken are keen to point out that having a tough childhood doesn’t necessarily mean that the children will grow up to be unhappy adults. ‘We’ve seen plenty of kids turn their lives around,’ says Ken. ‘They just need a chance to have decent people around them, and to be cared for properly like any regular child.’ These days, the couple mainly offer respite care for the kids that their daughters foster. ‘It’s nice because the kids don’t realise that they are coming for a respite break – they just see it as a visit to Nan and Pop!’ says Viv. ‘We’ve got so much out of fostering over the years – I wouldn’t change it for the world. aposWe won’t stop until we have to – Barnardo’s will say no to us before we say no to them!’  Fostering: The Facts ■ The number of children in care rose by % in the decade up to . ■ % of the , children in care are looked after by foster parents. ■ Over , children live with , foster families. ■ The number of foster carers is decreasing, due in part to birth children living at home for longer and rising house prices meaning people don’t have the required spare room and older foster carers are reaching retirement age while younger families are becoming increasingly responsible for their own parents’ care. ■ Barnardo’s are looking for more foster carers.

She celebrates Motheraposs Day today, not just with her own biological children but the five siblings she has bravely taken on responsibility for.Shannon, from Hartlepool, lost her mum Shelley Ellis to a rare disease last January, just nine days after she was diagnosed. She now lives with her expanded family and her partner Kieran Ferguson, and will today pay tribute to Shelley by visiting the tree where they spread her ashes.    I always wanted to be a mum, but I never imagined Iaposd have to fill my own mumaposs shoes and go from a mum-of-two to a mum-of-seven overnight, she said. But I promised mum Iaposd look after my brother and sisters. Sheaposd have hated to see them split up or in care, I never would have let that happen. We have our moments, but weaposre still one big, happy family - just as mum wanted.  The Ellis clan, who range from in age from two-year-old Rowan - Shannonaposs youngest son - to -year-old Mia, her oldest sister, will also mark Motheraposs Day by visiting the tree they spread Ms Ellisaposs ashes. For many years Shannon and Shelley were inseparable, as they grew up by themselves because her father was not on the scene. Seven years later, Ms Ellis began a new family when Mia, Neve, Bracken, Keevie and Blaine were born. Shannon said the family had a happy childhood.  Mum was just brilliant, she said. She did everything to provide for us - despite being a single parent and raising us all on her own. Sheaposd take us on family trips to the seaside and would muck in with us playing games. On a Saturday night sheaposd always rustle up a huge home-cooked feast. We had an amazing childhood and always felt very loved and protected by her. When Shannon began her own family with Kieran, she moved just around the corner to stay close to her mum and younger siblings. She would also help out as the oldest child, getting her younger brothers and sisters ready for school along with her hard-working mum.  Not a day went by where I wouldnapost see my mum, she remembered. She helped look after the boyswe were busy and taught me the tricks of the trade. She was besotted with her grandchildren, the same look Iaposd seen when my siblings were born all those years earlier, and I was so happy to have her help throughout their early years. I always thought sheaposd be there for me to give me guidance and to watch her children and grandchildren grow up. But tragedy struck in January last year when Shelley was rushed to hospital after being taken suddenly ill.  Doctors discovered she had a rare disease and sadly would not live much longer. Despite her trauma, Shannon promised her mum she would look after her younger siblings herself. Just nine days after falling ill, Shelley passed away, leaving Shannon bereft but determined to keep her promise. When she passed away, it didnapost hit me straight away. I just felt numb, she said.  But the one thing that kept me going was my brother and sisters and my own boys. I knew I had to get up each day to be there for them and to look after them. I canapost believe how strong my brother and sisters have been. They are coping really well and Iaposm really proud. We talk about mum all the time and constantly get photos out and laugh about the joy she brought to our family. She will always be the head of this family, and I am trying every day to follow the incredible example of motherhood she set.

Researchers who polled , meat-eaters identied the most popular beef-based meals – which also include chili con carne, cottage pie and corned beef hash. The top , which features many traditionally British dishes, also has a strong international flavour with offerings from Japan, Hungary, Mexico, Morocco and Germany all making the list. Such dishes include teriyaki beef, goulash, fajitas and schnitzel – among other worldwide cuisine such as beef tacos and beef stroganoff. Commissioned to celebrate Great British Beef Week, which takes place from  April until  April, the study found those polled eat beef eight times a month on average.    Jilly Greed, co-founder of Ladies in Beef, a organisation for female beef farmers, said: “It is great to see that so many people value the quality of British beef and are choosing some of our finest cuts to create international dishes, which are gradually becoming true staples in households across the UK. “British beef is nutritious, versatile and delicious and so, this Great British Beef Week we are urging the public to include more British beef in their diet, and taste the dference it can make to mid-week meals.aposapos Other popular beef dishes include steak and kidney pie, ribs and pot roast – along with beef in beer, beef pho and crispy chili beef. The research also found three quarters of those polled said they look forward to eating beef dishes more than any other. And  per cent said beef is their absolute favourite type of meat.    Perhaps unsurprisingly, the vast majority of carnivoresget their beef from the local supermarket. However,  per cent prefer to buy it from their nearest butchers. And two thirds said they make a concerted effort to buy British when purchasing beef. Flavour aside, for  per cent one of the big draws of beef is that it brings back fond childhood memories. In addition to coming top nationally, the traditional beef roast also came out top in every region of the UK - with exception of London where steak came first. West Midlands was also unique in that our beloved roast came joint top with steak. When it comes to inidual cities, roast dinner dominated again and was overwhelmingly the most popular beef dish. While the vast majority of those polled are self-proclaimed beef lovers, a slightly higher proportion of those from the North Eastidentied as such than the rest of the UK.  The research carried out through OnePoll found a whopping  per cent said they intend to eat meals containing beef during Great British Beef Week especially to mark the occasion.

My friend who works there told me about the traps by the bins and I have seen the droppings. A mouse literally ran across the floor in there not just a few days ago.

Whether you like it or not, there is a HUGE amount of interest in royal babies and Meghan Markle and Prince Harryaposs impending arrival has proven to be no dferent. So while thereaposs no word on where exactly the Duchess of Sussex is due to give birth , the world will be eager for that money shot of the new family on the hospital steps.    That said, not everyone is keen for Meghan to replicate Kateaposs stirling work in this field. Cha Hirschhorn is the CEO of  Fridababy and she is actively urging Meghan to skip the photocall. So passionately does Hirschhorn feel about this, that she took out a full page ad in the New York Times with an open letter to the Duchess . In aposAn Open Letter to the Royal Mom-To-Beapos, she wrote: Dear Royal Mom-To-Be,⠀⠀⠀  ⠀⠀⠀  ⠀⠀⠀ You will soon give birth to one of the most anticipated babies in the world and like your princess predecessors, youaposll be expected to parade outside of the hospital in front of throngs of photographers to show off your new bundle of joy shortly after giving birth.

But us mums will know that while you wave from that step youaposll be one pair of mesh underwear away from your first post-baby poop !    Spoiler alert: Bringing a new le into the world usually starts with your vagina, and the aftermath is a mess. The bleeding and swelling will linger, peeing will burn, and sitting like your old self will feel like a herculean feat. Anditaposs a C-section, there’s a whole host of other issues to tend to. Cha adds that no matter how chic she looks on the day, I promise you still wonapost feel like yourself. In case there is an expectation that Meghan and Harry greet their public, Cha advises:  If you really canapost skip it, then at the very least flash us a glimpse of the mesh underwear underneath to keep it real. Of course, the letter is meant to be slightly tongue-in-cheek, but itaposs a stark reminder of how unreasonable it is that we expect these women to smile and wave, babe in arms, mere hours after going through a huge physical trauma. Yes, the likes of Kate and Meghan may be immensely privileged - and this is arguably the price they pay for that privilege - but as we say, most mums would rather shave their eyebrows off than do this.

Daniele, whose family are of Italian descent, was travelling with his friend Matt Jones on the A in West Sussex when a s Hawker Hunter involved in a stunt display plunged from the sky and crashed. The jet exploded into a fireball and killed  people - including Daniele and Matt. Healthcare assistant Georgina, , had only just started seeing Daniele when he died. But a week after the funeral, she learned that she was pregnant with his second child, her first.  Tanya, , from Rustington, had broken up with Daniele in  following a four relationship and did not know he had a new girlfriend.Tanya told The Sun on Sunday that Georgina messaged her a week after the funeral and told her about the pregnancy.She admitted that she was not jealous but shocked and territorial. The two planned to meet up after Georgina gave birth to Jaxson but Tanya said she had doubts about how her own son Georgio - now seven years old - would cope following his fatheraposs death. She said Georgio had become a very angry child and was concerned it would be dficult for her to explain. She said: We met when Jaxson was five months old. They came to my house and I explained who Jaxson was. Georgio said, ‘Oh I love him’ and they sat on the sofa cuddling.    The two - who could have been love rivals - have now forged a bond and became friends after sharing memories of Daniele together. Georgina and Jaxson stayed at Tanya and Georgioaposs home every other night for three months. The four even spent Fatheraposs Day together at a beach in Goring-by-Sea, West Sussex, last year.

Scott Bessant was found seriously hurt near a bridge after a night out in the early hours of August , .Nearly  days later, -year-old former Wales Dragonhearts player remains unable to communicate with his own family and cannot walk or talk, Wales Online reports.He suffered multiple fractures to his skull, a fractured neck, broken ribs on his entire right side, a fractured pelvis, and has had multiple strokes since the incident. Mr Bessant, from Talywain, Pontypool, was drinking on the night before he was found by a passerby near a bridge in Abersychan in August .  According to those with him he was in a “happy, joyful mood” and had been dancing before he left the pub once it had closed. Mr Bessant’s brother-in-law, Neil Chere said: “We think he walked up the old line [a disused railway line] but as of yet, because nobody has been able to confirm that, we’re not sure.  “That was on his way home. It could take you about an hour to get to where he was. “From the time he left the pub until am in the morning we don’t know where he was. “All we know is that at am a member of the public who was going to work found him.”  In June Mr Bessantaposs family said he had awoken and his condition had improved. But now,  days after being found, the former fullbackaposs family say there is no progress. Mr Chere, , said: Since June his condition has not changed. Injury-wise thereaposs no movement. We are still praying for hope every day. Mr Bessant has now left Rookwood Hospital and is being looked after at a care facility. He still has daily therapy and regular tests to seehe can respond to stimuli. Mr Chere said: Thereaposs no massive change but sometimes weaposre sat with Scott and we think he knows weaposre there.  Mr Bessant was placed in critical care and remained in a coma for several months. A crowdfunder was created to help Mr Bessantaposs family buy a specialist vehicle to help him visit home and familiar places. They have since raised more than £, and the family are now looking for a suitable vehicle. Mr Bessant was also able to spend time at home with his family on Christmas Day. Mr Chere said: With the help of the ambulance service, who allowed us to have use of a vehicle on Christmas Day, we did have Scott home for a couple of hours. That moment was amazing. It meant so much to his mum and dad and the whole family.  In  amateur player Mr Bessant – then the top scorer for Newport Titans and having appeared twice for Wales A – was invited to train with Super League side Celtic Crusaders and hoped to turn professional. But dad-of-two Mr Bessant, who had scored on his international debut against Scotland the previous year, was unable to attend training after contracting salmonella. Mr Chere said previously: “He’s a doting dad. The most loving, caring person you could know. He’s a gentle giant. He’s the sort of person, and I know it sounds old-fashioned, butthere was an old lady crossing the road he’d go and help them. “And whatever happened nobody deserves what he’s going through. And it’s not just that it’s the knock-on effect on the family.

But it is one that could soon disappear, thanks to a repugnant but legal loophole in trophy-hunting laws. Giraffe body parts are turned into handbags, rugs and even bracelets – shockingly found on sale in the UK and all over Europe. Despite being on the Red List of Threatened Species, as just , survive, these majestic creatures are still being killed for sport by gruesome hunters who pose next to their slain bodies for selfies. As a result, numbers of the world’s tallest land animal have plummeted by % over the past three decades, but there is little awareness of their plight.    There are now fewer giraffes than elephants in Africa – a species almost obliterated thanks to the poaching trade. While there are several reasons for their decline, including loss of habitat, disease and illegal hunting for bushmeat, the alarming rise in sickening trophy hunters, overwhelmingly from the USA, could wipe out the species. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Floraallows giraffes to be killed indiscriminately, with their carcasses exported as trophies. Ironically, the United States is the only country with importing data available, showing nearly , giraffe “specimens” were shipped – including live animals. Armed ‘tourists’ rampaging through the bush, killing animals for pleasure is repellent and all the more so when the species is under threat. But this could all change at a meeting of CITES in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in May.    Key African ranger states want to outlaw the international trade in products derived from the creatures. This should be the turning point in reversing the decline, but it has little chance of success without the support of the EU voting bloc – so far hesitant to back it. Britain is well placed to lead on this with a long standing history of supporting animal welfare and conservation. It will be interesting to seeMichael Gove will make a stand by joining the African nations in making sure giraffes are better protected. Banning these products should not be a tall order.

So on April Fool’s Day, as you take a break from the clowns in Westminster to have some fun, beware – history is full of outrageous gags that seriously backfired.Here, History Revealed magazine , which is out now, shares  tales of hapless hoaxes and japes that really are mirth their weight in gold…Clf was the only one who cracked up In , a Brighton radio DJ told his listeners a replica of the Titanic was visible off the coast of Beachy Head – Britain’s highest chalk sea clfs. Hundreds of people rushed to the beauty spot, in nearby Eastbourne, East Sussex, only to discover it had all been a joke.    The clfs developed a five-foot crack under the weight of the crowds, with police urging people to leave before tragedy struck. Two days later, part of the site collapsed into the sea. Till being scared to death do us part A husband literally scared his new we to death – although you’d like to think John Ahrens did not intend the tragic consequences of his spooky prank.    In , Ahrens, a farmer from near Nashville, Tennessee, decided it would be hilarious to disguise himself as a tramp with a white mask to scare his beloved. When he knocked on their front door and asked Mrs Ahrens to cook dinner, she fainted and died within an hour. They had been married just a few months. Ahrens was said to be stricken with grief and remorse after the tragedy. Poor water gag sparked terrorist concerns It’s fascinating what the power of words can do. In , radio hosts in Kansas City created panic among listeners by reporting that local tap water contained high levels of dihydrogen monoxide.  They said the naturally occurring substance could lead to frequent urination and wrinkling of the skin. It’s not as bad as it sounds: dihydrogen monoxide is the chemical name for water. The police received more than  calls from worried residents and a city official likened the hoax to a terrorist act. The dihydrogen monoxide parody pops up every few years, as does hydrolixic acid. But worry not – that’s water, too. A lesson learned the hard way A schoolgirl prank got out of hand in  when pupils at the prestigious Lucy Cobb Institute in Georgia, US, thought it would be hilarious to abscond and have a day of fun.  As well as missing school, they also made the unladylike decision to wander around the town unchaperoned. What they were not expecting was for their headmistress to quickly write a letter to all of their parents, asking for their removal from the school to ensure its reputation was maintained. Astrologer didnapost see that coming... English astrologer John Partridge was known for his inaccurate predictions – and he certainly didn’t see Jonathan Swt, the author of Gulliver’s Travels, coming for him. Satirist Swt decided to have a bit of fun and give Patridge the bird with a bit of his own inaccurate medicine. Writing under the pseudonym Isaac Bickerstaff, he “predicted” Partridge would die “of a raging fever” in .  To confirm the tale, Swt then wrote of the death, pretending to be “a man employed in the Revenue”, and the news became public on April . Partridge protested but he never shook the rumours of his untimely demise and his career suffered. When he did die six years later, few believed it. Close encounters of the absurd kindThe threat of aliens came to the town of Jafr in Jordan in  as the front page of Jordanian newspaper Al-Ghad jokingly reported a UFO had landed near the desert town, with ft aliens sighted. Reports of communications being affected and neighbourhoods lit up by the lights from flying saucers terried the residents, with parents too scared to send their children to school while the local mayor considered a full evacuation. One reason why this may have gone badly wrong is that April Fool jokes are not that well known in Jordan. In the US, the prank was likened to the  broadcast of The War of the Worlds, which some mistook as being real. Jester had believers looking like a pudding A history professor was asked by a reporter in  about the origins of April Fool’s Day. Pressed for an answer, Prof Joseph Boskin, of Boston University in the US, invented Kugel the jester. Kugel, the tale went, told a Roman emperor that he – a lowly jester – could do a better job.  He was made emperor for a day, during which he called for pranks, thus starting the tradition. Prof Boskin said: “In a way, it was a very serious day. In those times fools were really wise… Jesters put things in perspective with humour.” The story was picked up by other media and it took weeks for them to get the joke: kugel wasn’t a jester – it’s a Jewish casserole or pudding. No smoke without being fired Fear spread among the residents of Milton, Massachusetts, after TV station WNAC-TV broadcast a news report in  that Great Blue Hill, a localmound was erupting.  They backed this claim with footage of Mount St Helens in Washington state, a volcano close to erupting, with an old commentary from President Jimmy Carter. At the end of the segment, a card was held up saying “April Fool”. But it was too late. Police were hit with calls from locals, with many considering leaving their homes. TV producer Homer Cilley was fired for a failure to “exercise good news judgment”. What a Cook up The Times newspaper in  ran an article on travel agent Thomas Cook celebrating the th anniversary of its founder’s first round-the-world tour.  A few pages later, the paper joked that the travel agent was offering such a round-the-world trip for the price it would have been in :  guineas. This was a fabrication, but queues formed at Thomas Cook shops across the country. Poor reporter John Carter lost his job. Analyst didnapost show much intelligence Tensions in the Middle East in the s were no laughing matter. Yet in , an Israeli intelligence analyst created a  April Fool’s Day report stating that Nabih Berri, the leader of the Amal Movement , had been wounded in an assassination attempt.  The story spread across Israeli radio before it was found to be a hoax and had to be retracted to prevent an international incident. The analyst was court-martialled and Israel’s defence minister faced questions in parliament. When did April Foolaposs Day start  April Fool’s Day has been celebrated in the UK since at least the th century. Although its origins are uncertain, the most likely explanation is it started after the th century Pope Gregory XIII decided to adopt the Gregorian calendar, which meant New Year’s Day would move from April  to January . Some people still celebrated the new year on April  and were branded “fools” – so the tradition of pranks began.Some April Fool jokes have been surprisingly successful. Perhaps most famously, in  the BBC’s Panorama ran a feature about spaghetti trees in Switzerland enjoying a bumper harvest due to good weather and the virtual extinction of the “spaghetti weevil”.The broadcaster was inundated with calls from Brits asking where they could buy a tree and plant their own.The latest issue of History Revealed magazine is out now"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42041090-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42041090-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42041090-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42041090-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"accident on dundee to aberdeen a90 route blocked as car flips onto roof","story":"A car flipped onto its roof on the main road between Dundee and Aberdeen.The A was partially blocked after crash, which happened at .pm, near  Laurencekirk.No one was injured in the incident.A Police Scotland spokesman said: “Traffic Scotland has been made aware – we’ve had numerous calls about it.“It involved a grey Seat Altea.

important at this stage of the season.“They are as fit as they are going to be so it was good mentally to get a wee break, knowing fine well what they are coming back to.“A little bit of down time

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 12","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPIC:This beautul sunset across Loch Etive at Connel was taken with a mobile phone by Fiona McCuish from Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"ardrishaigs spirits get a kelpie boost","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrivers were visibly doing a #double-take# driving through Ardrishaig.More used to seeing serried ranks of Sitka spruce piled at the harbour ready for loading on to cargo ships, motorists were instead treated to the majestic sight of two mini-Kelpies glimmering in the pierhead sunshine.A smaller-scale version of the iconic -metre high Kelpies sculpture which sit beside the Forth and Clyde Canal near Falkirk, the three-metre-tall #macquettes# were in fact used as a basis for the world-famous sculpture.The mini Kelpies arrived in Ardrishaig on the afternoon of Thursday March , sparking a mini social media storm in the Loch Fyne-side village.Their visit coincides with something of a revival in Ardrishaig, with the Scottish Canals-led regeneration of the former Gleaner and neighbouring sites to create a heritage hub due to open this summer."},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields need future plan","story":"NewsBob Shields: We need future plan for Ayr town centreRetail on our High Street is deadShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAt least five years ago – and certainly a whole elected council ago – I wrote on this page that Ayr town centre would have to change . . . or die. So please, allow me to confess that I actually got this the wrong way round. What I should have said was - Ayr town centre is going to have to die . . . and then change. And for better or for worse, that’s exactly where we are today. Our retail sector’s passing away was slow and painful. The ‘For Sale’ signs on our shop fronts began as a malady that grew into an illness - and finally became a virulent pandemic that was completely out of anybody’s control. The boarding up of a whole section of the “bottom of the town” was a warning symptom that our town centre was seriously ill. By the time BHS brought down their shutters for the final time – we were on le support. And our financial heart finally stopped beating when the leviathan that was once Hourstons was declared deceased on February . A post mortem in last week’s Ayrshire Post showed a record  shops in Ayr now lie empty. And alongside the report, a quote from council leader Douglas Campbell that . . “we have to ensure that our town centres become much more erse and about more than just shops”. I couldn’t have put it better myself, Mr Campbell. In fact, it’s almost exactly how I did put it . . . five years ago! To be fair to Mr Campbell and his Nationalist cohorts, five years ago they were languishing in opposition to a bullying Tory regime. While Big Chief Sitting Bill McIntosh ruled the class of  with  Tory councillors and some Labour nodding donkeys – the nine elected Nats sat in the naughty corner with as much power as my electric cigarette charger. After the  elections, it was role reversal. Labour jumped ship to prop up the Nats and now it’s the Tories who sit powerless – with a self-inflicted lurch from hapless to helpless. And following decades of Tory droning and dithering, the Nats of  looked like they might actually deliver something. Two years into their administration, we’ve witnessed everything from diddyness to dizziness. After last year’s budget farce and the great “Riverside Carbuncle” – the council tax paying public were right to wonderthis mob could run a tap - never mind a local authority! But in announcing their ambitious plans for a park, leisure complex, sports centre and the demolition of Burns House – we have to askour council has finally turned a corner that isn’t a blind alley  Have we reached that “rain in Spain moment” in My Fair Lady where the potty Professor Higgins finally says, “I think she’s got it!” Has SAC finally “got it”  Let’s hope so. If not – the “unprecedented funding” of £ million they’re ploughing into this will be the greatest waste of money in SAC history.The elephant in the room, of course, is the “building next to the Ayr Station”.How SAC can have a “vision” for Ayr town centre – without first resolving this nightmare – doesn’t make sense.Just in case they hadn’t noticed, the big sandstone thing draped in white IS the centre of Ayr!

The -strong #AyrDeservesBetter are a think tank of Ayr partisans - and they’ve delved into the past to come up with a future. A key plank is to rip-up the dated one-way system and construct a new inner ring road circling the historic centre. That involves re-using the old rail bridge across the River Ayr and incorporating Miller Road. Their new plan - called The Bruce - is in its infancy. The Bruce Plan has drawn ideas from a  map of the town centre.The #ADB advocates the entire bottom end of the High Street no longer being a shopping area, and all businesses relocated towards the top of the town. Spokesman Pat Lorimer revealed: “We looked at what was special on the  map then we added in the favourite shops, bars, cafes and walking routes. “You could argue  was the heyday of Ayr.” Though the Bruce Plan will not be published for several weeks, we can reveal a new traffic plan is a priority to replace the present shambolic system that confuses visitors. The new inner ring road system would not involve Sandgate at all. Pat said: “The current system was developed piecemeal without a master plan, that is why it is so hopeless. “When visitors come to town by car they actually have no idea where they are within Ayr because of the confusing road.” Seven piers of the old fishmarket railway bridge still exist and could provide the support for a new structure. The metal bridge was finally removed in , long after the single track rail had been pulled-up. The Bruce Plan is named after King Robert the Bruce who burned the English troops out of Ayr. The Ayrshire Post revealed last week there are  empty shops and buildings in the town centre area. The river end of the High Street would be completely given over to leisure and heritage. The council has already advocated demolishing the Citadel pool and sports hall and creating a new one at the Kyle Centre. Retired architect Pat revealed the group were “trying to run with” and help South Ayrshire Council rather than be against them. That’s despite the view the council has a poor executive compared to the way East and North are run. However, unlike Ayr Renaissance - which had a £,-a-year chief executive -they won’t be funded by the council. Pat said: “There is a great future for Ayr and we need to find it. “We need action, not another consultant’s paid for report and more talk.“We are a pressure group of like-minded people who all want to help Ayr.” Already signed up as members are Ronald Alexander, Toria Cassidy, Michael G Clark, Rob Close, Kirsty Darwent, Michael Davis, Peter de Moncey-Conegliano, David Dickson, Allan Dorans, Chris Fremantle, Christine Fremantle, Lianne Hackett, Nigel Hackett, Ali Logan, Patrick Lorimer, Andy McAvoy, Ian McKinnell,Norman McLean, Angela McNay, Alistair Paterson, Gordon Smith and Fiona Walker.

The deal Clic Sargent struck to sell the land and buildings to McCarthy and Stone hinged on planning permission being granted and the Prestwick development going ahead. But, with last week’s bombshell news that McCarthy and Stone pulled the plug on the project, the charity is stuck with a £.m white elephant. Clic Sargent agreed to sell the buildings and land in  and struck a £.m agreement with McCarthy  Stone. But when the developers unveiled their luxury flat plans they became embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work had to stop. And last week the developers announced they had pulled the plug on the project. Now it has emerged the entire deal was conditional on planning permission being granted and the development going ahead. Kevin O’Brien from Clic Sargent said: “We are hugely disappointed that the sale hasn’t gone ahead as we’d hoped. “Every day that this building sits empty it not only impacts on the people of Prestwick. It means that we are not able to provide vital support for all the children with cancer in Scotland who desperately need us. “Selling Malcolm Sargent House was a really dficult decision because we are extremely proud of its history and the role it played in the local community.” He added: “We continue to seek a buyer so that we can use this money to pay for vital services like our social workers and Homes from Home, which provide an essential leline for families when they hear the devastating news that their child has cancer.” Prestwick councillor Hugh Hunter said: “We now have a site that’s going to lie empty and Clic Sargent have no idea what they are going to do with it. “They also have a £.m black hole in their books. “It’s been a shambles.” In  a petition to save Malcolm Sargent House received nearly , signatures in just a week. Councillor Siobhian Brown, who launched the online protest, said: “I am sure in time it will be sold off again for residential development.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyrPrestwickSouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":null,"title":"girls party ayrs arthur street","story":"NewsGirls party at Ayrs Arthur Street Kitchen to raise money for Glasgow Childrens HospitalThe event will be held in aid of the hospital which cared for Laura-Jane Gillespies son, Korben.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR NewsArthur Street Kitchen girls Stevieleigh Paterson, Laura-Jane Gillespie and Aleisha Milligan \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum whose tot beat serious illness is to stage a glitzy charity bash.

Now Robert Dunlop has gained a criminal conviction for terrorising the people of Troon. The former Troon butcher, who turns  on April Fool’s Day, waged a letter vendetta against seven members of Troon Community Council. This reduced some community councillors to tears and one woman was so terried she now has a police panic alarm. Dunlop, of A Barassie Street, Troon, was found guilty on Friday by Sherf Scott Pattison of causing fear and alarm but not guilty of having a lock kne in Dundonald Road. His partner Krystyna Domanska, , was also on trial but was cleared of any involvement. Both had denied conducting the campaign between October  and September . Dunlop escaped with a slap on the wrist and has been warned to be of good behaviour for the next six months. His bail conditions banning him from approaching any of the community councillors will remain in place. This week a Troon Community Council spokesperson said: “We are very unhappy at the sentence but glad this man is now a convicted criminal. “He upset so many lovely volunteers in Troon and put us through the ordeal of having to give evidence in court. “It has been a very stressful time and we are all delighted this is now over.” Dozens of threatening letters were delivered to the home addresses of the community councillors. It was sparked when Dunlop lost the plot with the then South Ayrshire councillor Nan McFarlane, who had tried to help him in a benefits issue. The letters claimed the community councillors were involved in corruption, fraud and assault. Dunlop threatened to inform the public of this and claimed he was entitled to “bear arms and inflict violence”. The Ayrshire Post also received a nine-page letter, quoting an ancient Roman law called the Augustine Petition as the basis for the hostility. One y diatribe claimed all  South Ayrshire councillors were corrupt without providing any evidence. Other letters were despatched to South Ayrshire’s chief executive, legal head Ralph Riddiough, Troon police and the chief constable. Churches were also sent letters in a bid to blacken the names of citizens. Dunlop and Domanska made national headlines five years ago when the French village they were living in turned against them. They were accused of being neighbours from hell after building a wall, preventing the popular couple next door using their front door and nailing down their window shutters. The village mayor said the neighbours had been “terrorised” and Dunlop sent a -page letter to the French justice minister and an -page epic to then president Nicolas Sarkozy.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonScotlands CommunityAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thieving girvan florist ordered cough","story":"NewsThieving Girvan florist ordered to cough upLaurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February .ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsAnnabel Laurenson appeared at Ayr Sherf Court\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA thieving florist has made just one repayment on £ compensation ordered by a court, writes Edwin Lawrence. That was for £ - and was made over a year ago, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Yet social media pages during that time show Annabel Laurenson on days out all over south-west Scotland. They also show a new family car and pay-to-view sports channels in her family home. Laurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February . She admitted stealing from the Nicola Jayne Flowers business in Girvan on dates between January ,  and December , . Laurenson was ordered to complete  hours of unpaid work, and to pay back £ in compensation to her former bosses. The total value of cash and goods she stole was estimated at much more than this figure.    And the hurt and distress caused to her former employers, who were also her friends, can’t be quantied. Defence lawyer John Gallagher last week told Ayr Sherf Court that Laurenson, , had completed her unpaid work. But he admitted the only repayment she has made was the £ she turned up at court with - on the day of her sentence in February last year. Mr Gallagher claimed Laurenson, of Girvan’s Maxwell Street, had hoped to secure a loan from her father. But he died in November, and the costs of his care and his funeral made this impossible. “She is unemployed, but her husband is in work, and she is well aware this has to be repaid,” said Mr Gallagher. The lawyer said the remainder of Laurenson’s father’s estate would have to be shared with her mother and siblings. “How much is she likely to inherit ” asked Sherf John Montgomery. “I’m not sure,” said Mr Gallagher. “But not enough to pay this back.”    “The time for repayment has lapsed,” said Sherf Montgomery bluntly. Mr Gallagher insisted that Laurenson was anxious to pay the outstanding £. He asked the sherf to revoke the original payback order, and instruct a new compensation order. Mr Gallagher said Laurenson could pay £ per month, and Sherf Montgomery agreed to the request. Laurenson had worked at the popular Dalyrmple Street business for many years, and was a trusted member of staff. Shop owner Nicola Jayne Purdie said she was ‘devastated’ to find out her colleague and friend was ripping her off. She said at the time of last year’s sentence: “She stole a substantial amount of money and stock. There has been absolutely no remorse. She hasn’t said sorry. I feel betrayed. This is a family business and we were working together for  years.”Nicola Jayne said the theft came to light after she noticed discrepancies within the business. Laurenson who shared family occasions with the Purdies, including parties, weddings and funerals, offered no explanation for her behaviour.

Deloris is a Philadelphia lounge singer who dreams of stardom, but when she witnesses her lover-turned-gangster shoot one of his mob, she flees into the arms of good guy cop lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo .Delorisrsquo world is turned upside down when she is placed under witness protection in a rundown convent, disguised as nun Sister Mary Clarence.Although the adaptation does not feature songs from the original film, the musical repertoire is erse and magical.When we first catch a glimpse of the nuns, as they meander across the stage squawking like a bunch of demented penguins, I grimace. They are so out of tune I pray I donrsquot hear that god awful sound again.Upon learning that Deloris will be joining the convent, Mother Superior, played by Pam Graham, prays: ldquoDear Lordthis is a test, I cannot fail with you by my side. May she be of faith, of modestyhellip But she is stopped in her tracks by the voice of a brash American Deloris.Mother Superior continues: ldquoPerhaps the choir of angels drowned me out and you didnrsquot hear me Lord.Pam plays the exasperated Mother Superior prissy and clipped, with subtle comedy delivered in perfect tone.Of course things donrsquot run smoothly for the ghetto-fabulous a-turned-nun as you probably can imagine. It isnrsquot long before Deloris ruffles Mother Superiorrsquos habit and puts the nuns in danger, which leads to Deloris being given just one simple activity, joining the choir.Can she really unleash the songbirds trapped inside these nuns  This is when the show steps up a notch, and, although all dressed in habits, the audience can start to identy with the lead characters.In steps jolly Sister Mary Patrick, played by the enigmatic Claire Bell, along with Sister Mary Robertas the timid church mouse, and deadpan choir director Sister Mary Lazaruswho fully captured the gravelly voiced cantankerous nun. Her reprisal of the screen character is uncanny and garners lots of laughs from the audience.When the large ensemble of nuns gathered together, I did feel a sense of sisterhood and that they were each playing dferent characters despite having a minor role or no dialogue. Their pitch perfect delivery of lsquoRaise Your Voicersquo and lsquoTake Me To Heavenrsquo would draw the crowds into any church Irsquom sure.Playing the leading lady is no easy task, but in scene after scene Nicola embraces Deloris and puts her own sass and ghetto style into the character, belting out powerful tunes. To sum up her performance, what better words to use than those of Deloris Van Cartier herself ndash shersquos lsquoFabulous Babyrsquo!The last time I saw Lizzie Bell she was stumbling about drunk and shouting at a group of young kids, so I was shocked to see her convert to a Catholic nun. Of course, Lizzie was in character then as the vile orphanage boss Miss Hannigan, for Annie, performed by the Kids Innerleithen Theatre in November last year. The young actress shows true ersity, by portraying the meek Sister Mary Roberts with an enchanting solo performance.Although the female performances were powerful, they did not overshadow the male cast. Roger Brydon, Stewart Wilson and Colin Tweedie had me in tears as bumbling henchmen Joey, TJ and Pablo. Their comical performance of lsquoLady In The Long Black Dressrsquo didnrsquot leave females in the audience weak at the knees, but it did conjure up a few belly laughs!David Paterson was cast as Curtis who played the mob boss brilliantly, dominating the stage fiercely. And mild mannered officer Eddie Souterwho gave a cracking solo, proves he lsquoCould Be That Guyrsquo going from lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo to lsquoCool Copper, saving Deloris and winning her heart. A special mention to Jamie McCubbin, as the Irish Monsignor OrsquoHara ndashI closed my eyes Irsquod swear it was Father Ted!Needless to say the cast were at the top of their game, but anyone going to the show will no doubt be dazzled by the glitzy backdrop and detailed stained glass art of the fictional Catholic church.

Devices will also be given to P to P pupils at a ratio of one for every five children, although these will be kept at their school.The project will cost pound.m over a ten-year contract with American technology giant Apple and Canadian firm CGI.At a meeting of Scottish Borders Council on Thursday  March, opposition councillors sought clarication on a number of issues from council leader Shona Haslam.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson asked: how much will it cost to provide wi access for all nine high schools how much of the budget has been set aside for training teachers what targets have been set for teachers and finally, what will be the cost be of charging the iPads, and how will this be achieved Councillor Haslam who represents Tweeddale East, replied: ldquoWi-fi is already available in all Scottish Borders Council schools. The survey work is being contracted via CGI who have appointed a contractor. ldquoThe councilrsquos agreement with CGI is that the initial wi-fi surveys will be completed by the end of April . ldquoConvener, I must admit that I am a bit confused.

It reduces the poverty gap, it improves attainment, it reduces the burden on teachers, and provides digital learning access to ensure our young people are equipped for the future.ldquoAnd yet now the opposition are attempting to grill the administration on this policy. I had assumed that during the budget setting process the opposition were as robust as the administration, but these questions clearly show us that they were not.ldquoWhat is very clear is that the opposition have not read the papers, do not understand the project and are intent on opposing for oppositionrsquos sake.ldquoThis is a policy that last month you supported, that last month was included in your budget, and that last month thought was a great idea.ldquoTrue to form, you think something completely dferent.With regards to teacher training time, Ms Haslam said: ldquoTime has been set aside in the work time agreement for the first year of deployment of five hours dedicated training per teacher. More time will be set aside for training each year. ldquoThese sessions are to be scheduled in non-contact time and no additional cover requirement, or costs is expected.ldquoInspire learning is seen as a way of enhancing the process of teaching and learning, it is not envisaged that there will be a requirement for teachers to transfer existing materials in bulk.ldquoThe iPads can be used to access existing online educational content within glow and they can be used for sharing feedback on pupilrsquos work without the development of new materials.The first iPads will be rolled out to teachers in April , so they can get to grips with them and test out the system.S to S pupils will be the first schoolchildren in the Borders to receive their iPads, which will be handed to them in August .The following year, teachers of P and P pupils will be given iPads in April , and in August of that year the roll out will be extended to P and P pupils, as well as to new S pupils.Neither pupils nor their parents will be able to download apps or games to the iPad, as it will come pre-loaded with the necessary apps.Each iPad will have a block on harmful websites, which will continue even when connected to wi-fi outside of their school. The block will apply no matter which family member is using the iPad.During classes, the teacher will have complete control over each iPad.Ms Haslam continued: ldquoInspire Learning is designed to enhance the delivery of the whole curriculum and best practise will be developed to ensure subject teachers can collaborate effectively. ldquoA major benefit of the integrated learning is that teachers can easily share best practice online accessing a wide range of educational materials and do not having to develop subject specic resources by themselves.ldquoThere will be opportunities in the future for subject staff to collaborate between establishments and to share good practice on cross schools days and network meetings days.The council leader also confirmed that the cost of charging an iPad for educational use will amount to pound per year, and that students will be expected to bring their iPad to school charged each day."},{"url":null,"title":"budding-performers-sprinkle-some-stardust","story":"TALENTED young performers treated their audience to a musical extravaganza in Peebles on Saturday night.The Stardust Musical Theatre Company held its annual showcase to a sold out crowd in the Eastgate Theatre.lsquoA Night at the Musicalsrsquo was a greatest-hits compilation of some of the best-known songs from the world of musical theatre.The Stardust cast sang, acted and danced their way through nearly  great musical numbers.Now in its third year the Peebles cast, aged between five and  years old, moved its showcase up a gear with the most ambitious production to-date.Before the show began the packed audience was treated to a fun creative number replacing the standard audience announcement about safety and concert protocol.Musical number one was the ever popular, Wind in the Willows, where the performers donned animal attire to sing and dance their way over to Toad Hall.The junior and intermediate groups combined to bring this musical number to le.

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will

The wood surrounds a lake of the same name, which is actually a reservoir created  years ago.Pressmennan Lake is nearly km long and meanders through the wood, giving the appearance of a river rather than a loch. In summer, the lush canopy of trees which surround the lake can engulf the senses, and for a moment you can be fooled into thinking you are in the middle of an ancient forest.And in a sense, you are. The wood is a fragmentary remnant of the ancient oak wood which once covered most of our county. Records show it existed in medieval times, and Irsquom sure well before that.Much of it was felled, so tradition tells us, when the warship The Great Michael was built on the order of James IV around . This ship was famously constructed using the oak woods of Fe, but such was the size of the vessel that wood from where was also needed, including Pressmennan.Yet the wood seems to have survived, and in  the felling of trees here is said to have been stopped due to its importance as a habitat for the kingrsquos deer.It remains a place rich in wildle. Roe deer still roam free amidst the trees here. They are creatures of woodland magic, and native to these isles. They are small and nimble-footed, and will dart into the undergrowth at the sight or sound of approaching danger. They have short antlers and a tailless rear, which usually has a white patch. This is the part of the animal you most likely see, as it quickly bounds away from you.The wood is full of other wildle: owls and bats, hares and foxes, stoats and weasels, and, according to the Woodland Trust Scotland, who own and care for the wood, otters have also been seen in the lake. The birdle here is likewise rich, and there is a crescendo of song in the spring. The trust acquired the wood in  and is slowly restoring it to its natural character, planting oak and other native trees.We arrived at the wood last weekend, on a day of changeable weather, but laden with the promise of spring. There is a childrenrsquos map provided by the Woodland Trust and it proved a great hit for my kids, who followed the loch-side path looking for the features identied.These are wood carvings and sculptures made by artist Robin Wood. Part of the trail includes doors and windows in the trees which are said to be the homes of magical creatures called the Tootflits and Glingbobs.My children, well-versed in the folklore traditions of our county, know all about faeries, brownies, selkies, kelpies, witches and wizards. But Tootflits and Glingbobs were new to them, and to be honest myself as well.They are mythical creatures created by the artist and trust to provide a sense of wonder and adventure for children as they explore the wood. You can search for their homes and the wood sculptures along the way.And so we set off on our adventure of discovery. The path by the riverbank needs care with wee ones when wet, but it whispers magic. Ancient oak trees line the banks of the lake, their branches dipping into the water.These old trees were still leafless, biding their time for the arrival of spring proper. But they were a spine-tingling sight, a reminder of what once was here in abundance. But then, as we ventured deeper into the wood, we made a less pleasant discovery.Some people had decided it was a good idea to hammer coins into the sculptures, and even into the living trees. We found the homes of the Tootflits, and at their door was a pile of rusting coins which had clearly been left as a gt or good luck charm. Rusting coins also lay all around the base of the tree.I understand the desire to leave a gt or charm for a magical creature, but polluting and damaging nature with the ultimate symbol of materialism was, for me, horribly ironic.We removed what we could, and my daughter Skye searched for a more suitable gt. She found a small lsquofaerie cuprsquo, which was the cupule of an acorn, and placed it on the doorstep.ldquoThere, she said, with a sense of satisfaction.We continued our search but we found every sculpture defaced in the same way. One had actually collapsed due to the splintering and rot caused by the coins being hammered into it.The final sculpture was a frog on a log. It too was peppered with coins hammered into its body. In the universal measure of things, this damage was insignicant and perhaps even well-meaning, for I assume it was done by people who came to enjoy the wood and merely wanted to leave their charm here.But eventhere was no malice, it was a desecration. Then my heart tore as I watched my children scrape their fingers as they tried to pull the coins from the poor creature. But they were mostly rusted and too well-embedded.As we left the wood, I was reminded of a famous quote, attributed to the Native American chief Seattle: ldquoTake only memories and leave only footprints.The word lsquophotosrsquo is often used instead of memories but the message is the same, and now more powerful than ever. Itrsquos a worldwide issue ndash the desecration of natural sites by people who unthinkingly want to leave their mark. The coins that werenrsquot rusted we put in a charity box.The experience affected my daughter.ldquoCan you write about what we found, dad, and ask people not to do that  said Skye at bedtime. ldquoAsk them to find presents in nature, like faerie cups or stones or fallen branches or pine cones or berries, or even make a love heart shape in the ground. Faeries donrsquot like metal anyway or need money.And I promised her I would. As she slept, I kept my promise."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-racecourse-business-continuing-to-be-conducted-in-private","story":"Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeewas established by East Lothian Council last February after the British Horseracing Authority threatened to pull the coursersquos licence to race over concerns about its governance.Relations between members of predecessor body Musselburgh Joint Racing Committee were described as ldquofestering.It was made up of four East Lothian councillors and three members of Lothians Racing Syndicate , the latter representing racing interests.But the two factions were described in an independent report as having ldquoconsiderable mistrust, weariness, resentment and bitterness.Staff under the previous committee threatened to strike and there were claims of a lack of transparency surrounding their meetings and decisions.The independent report by Pinsent Mason was branded commercially sensitive by East Lothian Council, which refused to publish it until an investigation by the Information Commissioner led to a redacted version being made public.In February last year, the council replaced the old management committee with MRAC, giving the council a - majority over LRS.However, MRAC has held only four public meetings in council chambers in Haddington Town Hall since it was set up, with  of the  items of business on the agenda heard in private.On each occasion, the council has cited Local GovernmentAct , paragraph six, which allows it to exclude the public for ldquoinformation relating to the business affairs of particular persons other than the authority.East Lothian Council said that it ldquolooks to ensure that, as far as possible, committee matters are progressed in public.A spokesperson added: ldquoThe MRAC often considers matters in public session.ldquoAs with other committees, some reports may require to be held in private should they contain exempt information.Reports which have been withheld from the public include the current yearrsquos budget, financial reviews and racecourse general managerrsquos report.East Lothian Council is currently looking for a third-party operator to take over the running of the racecourse, which is on Common Good land.The hunt for a new operator is currently out to tender with hopes an appointment will be made before the end of this year."},{"url":null,"title":"prestonpans-shop-could-feature-on-bbc-show","story":"Corner Shop Cook Off is coming to screens across the country to show off the importance of local convenience stores in Scotland.The new show is presented by actress and musician Clare Grogan, with winner of MasterChef The Professionals Gary Maclean as the resident chef.Each week, a prominent Scottish chef will guest star, going head to head with Gary, only using ingredients from a selected local convenience store from around the country.The Day-Today on Redburn Road in Prestonpans has been selected as a possible store to feature on the show and,it is picked, the BBC portable kitchen will be set up in Prestonpans Town Hall for the event next month.The BBC said that it wanted the local shop owner and the customers to be the judges, adding: ldquoThis means we can really get into the heart of towns all over Scotland and show how essential the local convenience store really isIf confirmed, Corner Shop Cook Off will be filmed on April  and  in Prestonpans Town Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrations-as-prestonpans-charity-elcap-marks-its-30th-birthday","story":"The Lighthouse Hub hosted the event with a buffet, guest speakers and local musicians.Even microphone problems and a broken slideshow couldnrsquot dampen the mood as the birthday bash opened with two pipers from Preston Lodge High School Pipe Band.Bette Francis, member of the ELCAP board, hosted the event, introducing the speakers: chief executive Paul White, ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell, and lastly a moving testimony from fellow board member Kirstin Doherty.Paul White, who was appointed chief executive five months ago, started the talks by outlining the importance that ELCAP played within communities, a point that was reiterated by guest speaker Councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell.The final speaker, Kirstin Doherty, a member of the ELCAP board, has been supported by the charity since .

This proved to be extremely popular and was vastly oversubscribed, so there is an urgent need for homes like ours.ldquoWe understand that this site in Prestonpans had been earmarked for commercial use but, in the absence of any confirmed interest, we had hoped that our plans, which would enhance the local environment and provide much-needed affordable housing, would have been supported."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-residents-urged-to-switch-off-for-earth-hour","story":"Earth Hour encourages people to turn off all non-essential lighting for one hour and is being supported by East Lothian Council.Every year, millions of people participate in the WWF global movement to raise awareness about climate change and the human impact on the earth.Major landmarks such as the Efel Tower, Buckingham Palace, Edinburgh Castle and the Sydney Opera House switch off all lights and visual displays run by electricity for the hour.Earth Hour takes place between pm and pm tomorrow."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-hopeful-of-vastly-improved-service-at-musselburgh-gp-surgery","story":"The group was highlighted by Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, who recently met Jeane Freeman MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, following ldquooverwhelming public concern regarding the serious lack of appointments to see a doctor and the poor level of service offered by the practice.Mr Beattie stated that a spokesperson from the medical practice, which is based at Musselburgh Primary Care Centre, indicated that ldquoimprovements in the way patients are being cared for in Musselburgh are in the process of being made.Early evaluation of the way services were being delivered since the launch of the Collaborative Working for Immediate Care service ndash run by East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnershipand the merged Eskbridge and Riverside Medical Practices ndash demonstrated that patients who previously would have seen a GP were now seeing the right clinician at the right time for their specic needs.The new service, developed in partnership by Riverside, NHS  and ELHSCP, ensured that urgent care was dealt with on the same day and patients should have ldquono anxieties about being seen by the right professional at the right time.Through this new way of delivering patient care, it not only provided an increase in the number of patient appointments with practice GPs and other healthcare professionals, but also provided an increase in appointmentfor patients with complex needs.A recent survey conducted within the practice demonstrated that more than half of patients agreed that they did not always need to see a GP.Work is also under way by ELHSCP to implement a new telephone and IT system that will support call demand into the practice.The importance of patient involvement in getting services right is ldquovery much recognised by the practice, which is encouraging residents to get involved with the Patient Participation Group.Speaking after meeting with the Cabinet Secretary, Mr Beattie said: ldquoI would like to assure all of my constituents that patient care is of paramount importance and that all agencies involved in the new way services are being delivered within Musselburgh Primary Care Centre are focused on delivering the best care possible.ldquoRiverside Medical Practice is working with other organisations to ensure that improvements are made and I would encourage anyone with any issues regarding the practice to get in touch with them and become involved with the patient participation group.ldquoI am hopeful that the improvements being made by the organisations will be seen by patients and a vastly improved service will be delivered.ldquoI will continue to closely monitor the future performance of the practice and ask patients to keep me advised on whether the improvements are working."},{"url":null,"title":"seatbelt-embarrassment-spurs-on-musselburgh-couple-to-big-weight-loss","story":"Derek Melon, , a customer services advisor, and his we Carole, , a mortgage advisor, of James Street, are both feeling ldquofantastic after their bumper weight loss, which was sparked by a holiday to Florida.Derek has dropped five stones from st lbs to st lbs, and Carole, who weighed in at st lbs, lost four-and-a-half stones to get to st lbs since they joined Weight Watchers in June last year.Their journey started after the couple, who have a teenage son, booked a holiday to Florida.Carole said: ldquoI was so excited but the plane journey going left me feeling humiliated and not happy as I had to request a seatbelt extension as I could not fasten the original seatbelt.

She called it Big Baby.She decided it was a girl and it became her favourite doll. It was soft and easy to cuddle, and Manja would take it with her everywhere.After years of being carried, played with and subjected to all manner of pampering with nail polish and make-up, the condition of the doll began to deteriorate.Then one day, Big Babyrsquos right leg came off! The seam holding the leg had torn and repeated repairs failed.At that time, I suggested we could replace her. But my daughter looked at me in horror: ldquoJust because she has one leg doesnrsquot mean I love her less.I remember being stung by my own insensitivity. Big Baby was not just an old doll, and I should have known that.Manja was six then. She is near  now. She has obviously grown in her games and play, yet Big Baby remains an important part of the family. But the loss of her dollrsquos leg led Manja into talking about disability. Over the years, it was a topic she wouldto when she was playing with her. She adapted clothes for Big Baby and refused to treat her as broken, or any less a doll.Then, recently, during one our story-making sessions together, she suddenly came up with this tale. We then wrote it down. I helped her with spelling and some phrases, but otherwise this is all her work and idea.I agree that children need to be taught empathy, but they often soon get it in ways adults forget, as I did. The discrimination and prejudice we encounter is taught by adults to children. Butwe listen to our children, they can often be the best teachers of understanding and empathy for us all.So here is Manjarsquos tale, which she titled The Magic Bracelet:Once there was an old man who had a foot which wouldnrsquot work and so he had dficulty walking.He had to use crutches and people said he was disabled, and because of this nobody would give him a job.So to get some money he would sit by the roadside and make porridge. Hersquod sell bowls of it to people who were walking by on their way to work. He told them that porridge was healthy and the best breakfast, which is true of course.So people would give him a penny for a bowl of his delicious porridge. That way he made some money.One day, while he was making his porridge, a young girl came and told him she would love to have a bowl of porridge but she had no money. The porridge maker gave the girl a kind smile.ldquoNever mind, he said, ldquoI always make extra just in case itrsquos needed.He handed her a bowl of porridge and she sat down and ate it. She was very hungry.As she gave the porridge-maker the bowl back, she noticed his crutches leaning against the wall.ldquoWhy do you have crutches  asked the girl.The porridge-maker looked sad and told her that he couldnrsquot walk very well because of his foot that wonrsquot work. He explained he needed his crutches to walk.The girl thought for a moment and smiled at the porridge-maker.ldquoI have a friend who can help you so you wonrsquot be disabled anymore, she said. The old man smiled at her, but this time it was a sad smile.ldquoThat is very kind of you, he said to the girl, ldquobut the doctors have told me that there is nothing that can be done to fix my foot, so I will be disabled for the rest of my le.ldquoPlease meet my friend, asked the girl. So the porridge-maker agreed.The girl helped him up and he walked slowly with his crutches with her. She took him to a beach.ldquoWait here, Irsquoll go get my friend, said the girl. The old man sat on the sand and waited for a long time. Eventually the girl ed.ldquoHere, she said, ldquotake my hand and Irsquoll take you to my friend. But first you must wear this shell bracelet.It was a beautul bracelet, made from dferent shells. He put it around his wrist.The porridge-maker went to pick up the crutches but the girl said: ldquoNo, leave them there, you will not need them.ldquoBut I canrsquot walk without them, he said. The girl just smiled and said: ldquoTrust me. So he did.She held his hand and slowly led him into the sea.He was hobbling at first, but the sea rose over his legs and his body got lighter in the water. Soon he was up to his waist in water.ldquoI cannot swim, said the porridge-maker, now feeling worried.ldquoTrust me, said the girl, ldquoI am wearing a bracelet as well, so we will e in together.So he trusted her and he ed into the water. Suddenly, he realised that there was some magic happening because he could breathe under the water. And he wasnrsquot cold or afraid.Then he saw the girlrsquos friend. She was a mermaid. ldquoWelcome, said the mermaid.ldquoYou see, said the girl, ldquoI told you my friend could help. The bracelet is magic, it gives you the ability to be like a mermaid and swim under the sea.The porridge-maker swam perfectly under the sea. He was not disabled under the sea. He could swim fast and he did circles and back flips. He smiled at the girl, this time a happy smile.ldquoThank you, he said. She smiled a happy smile back: ldquoMy friend said you can keep the bracelet and use it as often as you want.And so he did. And he realised it wasnrsquot his foot which made him feel disabled, but other people being unkind and making fun of him or treating him as useless.He still couldnrsquot walk well, but he knew he could breathe and swim under the water like a mermaid, while those who made fun of him couldnrsquot. And he could make the most delicious porridge ever.

There was Ted looking a bit shty, right when it seemed that everything has been tied up neatly in a bow.Whether Ted could be ldquoH, the corrupt police officer with a hand in almost every diabolical conspiracy running through Jed Mercuriorsquos award-winning police procedural since it began in , has become the subject of feverish speculation among the showrsquos fans.Adding fuel to the flames, a BBC promo shot shows Hastings handcuffed to fellow AC- officers DS Steve Arnott and DI Kate Fleming, played by Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, with a tagline that reads: ldquoCrime needs an inside man.As Dunbarrsquos dulcet Northern Irish tones drt down the line, I opt to tackle the swirling rumours head-on. Please say itrsquos not so, Adrian hellipldquoAt the end of the last series there was this indication that Ted was under some kind of suspicion and that is followed through on, says Dunbar. ldquoIt does not look very good for Ted, I have to say.ldquoEverybody is going to have to hang tough with the whole thing because it unravels bit by bit across the full series. He does come under suspicion and that is followed through on.Gulp hellip The fth series of Line of Duty, which gets under way this evening, will centre on organised crime groups .Itrsquos been two years since we last caught up with AC- ndash Mercurio has been off making hit BBC thriller Bodyguard starring Richard Madden ndash and as the new series begins viewers are immediately thrust into the action when a balaclava-clad gang ambushes a police convoy.Fans will be delighted to learn there are plenty of classic-style Line of Duty moments to look forward to over the coming weeks, including jaw-dropping twists, shock betrayals, grisly crime scenes, marathon interrogations ndash and, yes, those delicious Ted-isms.Dunbarrsquos character has garnered quite the following for his phraseology and quick one-linerswith the actor deftly introducing a clutch of Northern Irish colloquialisms such as ldquofella and ldquonow wersquore suckinrsquo diesel that didnrsquot appear in the original scripts.ldquoI had no idea these things were going to catch on, he laughs. ldquoOr that people would be playing pub games with them. Ted Hastings bingo  ldquoYes, it is a bit mad. I have got a good one coming up ndash I think it is in episode one ndash but Irsquom not going to tell you what it is. It is a real bang-on Belfast one.The eldest of seven children, Dunbar, , grew up in Enniskillen where his late father was a carpenter and his mother worked as a cook. As a teenager he aspired be a musician but then found acting after a cousin introduced him to a local amateur drama group.Dunbar studied at Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London and went on to roles in critically-acclaimed films such as Hear My Song and The Crying Game. Hersquos been a regular on our screens over the past four decades, popping up in A Touch of Frost, Silent Witness and Ashes to Ashes.Since , hersquos played Hastings in Line of Duty and his fondness for the character is palpable. Showrunner Mercurio is said to have initially envisaged the AC- boss as more of a shambolic figurehead in the beguiling manner of TV detective Columbo, as played by Peter Falk.When Dunbar was cast and brought his own take on Hastings, Mercurio saw the strength in having a proactive and dynamic leader who would also be a mentor to Arnott and Fleming.ldquoHe [Mercurio] realised the series needed that person, somebody who is bright, tough, sharp and could handle dficult scenarios, says Dunbar.ldquoTed is old school. I think people like that about him. But he is also quite vulnerable and insecure sometimes, so it is not all kick the door in. He is tough where the letter of the law is concerned but he is not entirely a tough person himself.Dunbar says he drew inspiration from the style of great Scottish footballing managers such as Jock Stein, Bill Shankly and Alex Ferguson when breathing le into Hastings.ldquoHe has a good man management style and sense of morality, he says. ldquoThat kind of character who has a way with people and they trust him. They know that ultimately, evenit is to his own detriment, he will always do the right thing.Line of Duty is set in an unspecied, generic Midlands town. The first series was shot in Birmingham with subsequent episodes filmed in Northern Ireland, chiefly around Belfast.That suits Dunbar down to a tee. ldquoI love going back to Northern Ireland, he enthuses. ldquoMe and Martin [Compston] often talk about the idea that we might get a sht over to Glasgow some year, but that has not happened as yet. We could have a right laughwe got to Glasgow as well.ldquoBelfast is great. It is a small city and we can get around it easily enough. We have got to know it really well over the years. Of course, for me, itrsquos great because I get to see friends and my family can come to see me ndash all that kind of craic.The actor has often spoken about striving to keep his own accent for roles whenever possible because he believes it lends greater authenticity.ldquoIt is always important to get regional accents up there, asserts Dunbar. ldquoWhen you think of the likes of Bill Paterson or the guys who came out of : bringing Scottish accents to the screen and not feeling the necessity to change their accents.ldquoBut also, I think it really fits the part [in Line of Duty]. I wouldnrsquot try and do itit didnrsquot. It fits the part to have [Hastings] speak like that.ldquoThere are aspects about it that are useful such as the fact he was an RUC officer and he would have had training in anti-terrorism which figures a lot in AC-.ldquoWhen he comes to head up AC- he is an outsider. There is nobody in the rest of the police force that you would think would be able to get to him on a personal level or who would know him from before. All those things help to locate him as being from Northern Ireland.Compston revealed during an earlier series that his estuary English twang as Arnott began to slip slightly, seeing his own Greenock accent begin to creep in, due to exhaustion as the gruelling filming schedules took their toll.At least Dunbar doesnrsquot need to worry about that  ldquoNo, thatrsquos right, he chuckles. Although thatrsquos not to say Line of Dutyrsquos famed kne-edge interrogation scenes are a doddle to shoot. In fact, far from it as Dunbar can testy.ldquoThose things are very tough, he says. ldquoI have to learn sometimes  pages at a time. The takes can last  minutes ndash we do big, long takes. You always hope that you get a couple of days in between so you can learn the next one because you canrsquot keep everything in your head at the one time.ldquoPolice are allowed to look at their notes so, some of the actors, they can look down at their notes and see what is coming up next. But I canrsquot do that because I donrsquot wear glasses in the part, soI look down, I canrsquot see anything. I have to learn everything. Which is fine but it is tough.Line of Duty has earned a reputation for its high calibre of guest stars who have included Keeley Hawes, Daniel Mays and Thandie Newton among others.The latest series is no exception with Boardwalk Empire and This Is England actor Stephen Graham joining the cast as the elusive ldquoBalaclava Man and Rochenda Sandall, known for her roles in Black Mirror and Love, Lies and Records, as AC-rsquos formidable suspect, Lisa McQueen.Does bringing in names like this help keep things fresh  ldquoI think so but the main thing is that Jed keeps the standard of his work up, says Dunbar. ldquoUnbelievably, he seems to be able to do that every time. When we come in and read the new scripts, we are always very excited.ldquoBut then, of course, you have to marry those new characters with great actors.

Alas, support for Saudi Arabia and other autocracies perhaps undermines the lofty rhetoric.However, take the policy intention at face value and imagine the FCO staging a seminar tomorrow on exporting the Westminster brand of democracy across the globe.In explaining the last three years, civil servants would have to run through how Theresa May, in compounding the follies of her hapless predecessor, had committed the most appalling series of blunders of any Prime Minister in a century.She triggered the Brexit process without having any idea of what she wanted to achieve. She set ldquored lines that were entirely aimed at her own MPs, many of whom are so zealous that they would never support her. Her eventual deal was easily rejected three times by Parliament. And the same legislature voted down all other alternatives.The FCO seminar would have to conclude that the UK had gone from being viewed as a beacon of democracyto a laughing stock. Westminster proceedings are getting more coverage around the world than ever before, but not for positive reasons. MPs should dread the next poll on faith in our democratic institutions.But the humiliation of the House of Commons as an institution should not result in us shying away from asking the most fundamental question - what is the solution to this crisis In a repeat of last weekrsquos debacle, MPs will tomorrow vote on a raft of alternatives to the May deal which,passed, could form the basis of a radically dferent offer to European negotiators. Other options, which wonrsquot be voted on, are also in the mix.In what will inevitably dominate the news cycles next week, May is expected to bring back her discredited Withdrawal Agreement again. It is an understandable tactic in theory, but in practice the pro-Remain Speaker of the House will be unlikely to accede to Government demands. John Bercow blocked a third ldquomeaningful\" vote on the grounds that little had changed from the second snub it seems improbable he would jettison his own ruling.A ldquoconfirmatory vote, which was narrowly rejected last week, will probably come back but the plan is problematic on a number of fronts. Hatched by two Labour MPs from very dferent constituencies, the idea is simple: Mayrsquos deal is pitted against Remain in a public vote, the result of which would be legally binding.However, such a move would be unfair to Leave voters. Mayrsquos deal has been ridiculed and is tarnished. Half the pro-Brexit side would probably sit out a referendumher deal was on the ballot. For any second referendum to pass the fairness test , voters would need to be presented with a Brexit option backed by Leavers. The current \"deal\", by contrast, is lying in the gutter, promoted by a Prime Minister who looks like a zombie in The Walking Dead.Labour and the SNP have suggested that a general election would be an appropriate response to this catastrophe. I can see why political parties, eyeing electoral gain, would find this option attractive, but its dficult to argue that going back to the voters will somehow break the deadlock and produce a workable solution. Parliament is ided because the country is ided.Consider a new Tory leader, elected on a  of ripping up the May plan and starting negotiations again with the EU, winning a majority at the polls. It is conceivable, at a push, to imagine a comfortable majority of Tory MPs endorsing a harder form of Brexit, but it almost impossible to envisage the EU signing up to this fantasy. Mayrsquos deal is the hardest form of Brexit the EU will agree to.A Corbyn premiership would run in to even bigger problems. Given the Labour leaderrsquos euro-scepticism, he would contest the next election on a commitment to deliver a ldquoLabour Brexit, which would be softer than the May plan. But just as the right-wing European Research Group has tortured May, so too would Corbynrsquos colleagues try to sabotage his blueprint. Most Labour MPs, like the party membership, are staunchly pro-Remain and would revoltit appeared that the leadership was attempting to implement Brexit.The so-called ldquosoft Brexit options have the best chance of securing MP backing this week. Tory veteran Ken Clarkersquos customs union plan fell by a handful of votes. His colleague Nick Bolesrsquo suggestion of a ldquoCommon Market . also looks like a strong runner, particularlythe SNP back it on tactical grounds. It is not beyond the wit of man to imagine a form of words being devised that commands a parliamentary majority.However, a ldquosoft Brexit ndash loosely based on Norwayrsquos close relationship with the EU ndash looks like the worst of all worlds. Norway is not a member of the EU, but must abide by freedom of movement and is also bound by single market rules that it has little say over. For want of a better cliche, the UK would become a rule-taker, not a rule-maker. It would be the opposite of taking back control and further damage the reputation of Westminster.The solution lies in understanding the root of the current problem. In a fatal mistake in , Mayinvoked the Article  process on the UKrsquos withdrawal, thus setting a deadline on the EU and MPs reaching an agreement. She did so without having an indication of the type of deal that could get passed by both sides. We are now in a position of begging the EU for mercy.Two options present themselves. The first, in recognition that Parliament cannot agree on a way forward, is to seek a y extension from the EU, probably in the region of  months. Earlier this year, the Herald on Sunday published impassioned pleas from range of figures across civic Scotland who backed an extension earlier this year, and they were right to do so. However, it contains the drawback of setting another articial deadline.A better solution would be to revoke Article , an option that is on the table thanks to a court case pursued by Scottish parliamentarians. This would not be about stopping Brexit, but would instead give MPs and the public a chance to breathe without the stress of   melodrama and stories about medicine shortages. More than  million people voted Leave in  they did not vote to Leave on March , or April . A date was not on the ballot.Halting the process would allow May to stand down and for the the Tories to elect a successor in a contest that would not have to be rushed. It could result in a general election and a change of Government. It would allow a national conversation to take place on the type of Brexit the country wants, and whether it should be put to a referendum. It would take no deal off the table. It is time to stop the clock.Even then, revocation would require our politicians to stop acting in their own narrow party interests, and start recognising that the future of country is at stake. The present conditions are ripe for extremism ... and Westminster should be aware of that, and act accordingly."},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-blythman-reviews-nero-a-meta-in-edinburgh","story":"We soon realise that the food here isnrsquot what wersquod expected.

But I do agree that a little sodium chloride would improve it.Starters proper are a mixed bag.

You can feel what is out there, in the ether.\"To not be coming to some kind of positive conversation about things at the moment, feels like fiddling while Rome burns.\"We spoke in his sparse office at the top of The Hub, the EIFs base at the top of the Royal Mile, two days before the  programme was officially revealed to the world. Linehan added: \"Itrsquos also driven by the fact that there are so many artists right now, who are really wanting to address bigger questions. Generationally, therersquos also a sense of that.\"Itrsquos not agitprop [art as propaganda], because a lot of it is storytelling ndash its not just taking a political position and hammering it home. But it is talking about some of things ndash whether its talking about the environment, or gender issues, or whatever  ndash and addressing them quite directly. Its something that is there in the programme as a season, but it is also informing what we do more generally.\"It also gives us the chance to be more flexible, to have more work from Burkina Faso or the Lebanon or Greenland: to be able to spread our wings in terms of the programme.\"McGrath said the festival, which was formed in the aftermath of the devastations of the Second World War in , is also thinking about its place in a world in turmoil, and looking ahead to its th birthday in .She said: \"I think there is something very interesting and resonant in approaching the birthday, and thinking about the beginnings of the festival, and thinking that arts and culture might have a role to play in redefining or re-articulating what citizenship might be, or what internationalism might be.\"McGrath added: \"In the st century, in the times we are living in, what really does citizenship mean  What are our responsibility to ourselves and others in a very changed world. What does internationalism now mean  Here we are, at the end of March, wondering what that means for the UK. This feels like an incredible opportunity to think about it in a properly international context.\"These are international artists, thinking about migration, climate change, changing ideas about identity, equality...it feels like theres some really big stuff that artists are grappling with.\"At the heart of You Are Here is the three week-long conference of  writers from around the worldwho will, at the end of the festival, reveal a new \"manesto for the world\". Their conference will have three parts daily: the Morning Manesto, where ideas and beliefs will be discussed, Call and Response at pm, and in the evening, Breaking Bread, where audiences will be able to have a meal with an artist.This group, led by David Greig, the playwright and artistic director of the Royal Lyceum, is being inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was made in .McGrath, who is also director of Fuel theatre company, said: \"We were thinking of bringing something new to the festival. It felt appealing to me in that a lot of the work I have been doing is looking at extraordinary artists, that have an unusual perspective or insight into the world, and the ability to share that with an audience in a way that holds within it the possibility of change ... and of engaging in the world we live in.\"These are artists who are really trying to engage in the big questions of our times.\"The shows in the new strand include Hear Word! Naija Woman Talk True, which will feature  of Nigerias biggest stars of stage and screen on stage to tell \"multi-generational stories of inequality and transformation\".La Reprise by Milo Rau, an oft controversial star of theatre, is an \"audacious piece of investigative theatre\" which looks at the violent, real-le murder in Belgium of Ihsane Jarfi in  .Red Dust Road is also part of the strand, the National Theatre of Scotlands production of the Makar Jackie Kays memoir, which has been adapted for the stage by Tanika Gupta.Other shows include Purposeless Movements, by Birds of Paradise theatre company, written by Robert Softley Gale, a leading disabled Scottish artist and writer of My Left Right Foot ndash The Musical.Hard to be Soft: a Belfast Prayer, by Oona Doherty, the Belfast-based choreographer and dancer, will look \"behind the masks of violence and machismo to the inner lives of Belfast hard men and strong women.\"Softley Gale said: \"Of course EIF must be addressing current, political issues - this is core to art in  staying relevant to our society.\"Disabled people make up % of the population and have a right to see themselves, their lives and their experiences reflected in the world around them.\"But perhaps more importantly, the wider population need and want to see stories that havent been explored yet - the stories of disabled people need to become an integral part of our Scottish culture.\"Linehan said that while each show tackles all kinds of issues, the strand does not posit one particular view of the world. He said that he acknowledges that the audiences at the Festival ndash particularly given their international make-up ndash may not have a consensus on how they view the world at its issues.He said: \"We donrsquot have a particular didactic point.\"Its more that there is such complexity in the world ndash and given that with all the festivals we have the great social gathering of the world, and also a great cultural gathering ndash I think that is fair to say: How is that responding to a world that is in a real state of flux \"I mean, we talked a lot about  being about citizenship, and what it means to be a citizen of a place  I think Edinburgh is having a conversation about that as well. So why do you draw that circle, of where you are from and what you have responsibility for: but that can be done with a great sense of fun.\"And that is something that Edinburgh has always had, the capacity to mix its seriousness with a quite Bacchanalian madness as well.\"McGrath says that the new strand is a \"pilot\" for future work of the same kind, a word that Linehan also uses.That You Are Here is happening at all is due to some combined forces: the British Council, the University of Edinburgh Futures Institute, as well as Place funding, the new poundm funding potprovided by the Scottish Government, City of Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh Festivals.She added: \"Edinburgh has this extraordinary history of being at the forefront of conversations about what citizenship is, what a civic society might mean or be, and it is changing now.\"I grew up in Edinburgh, and moved away, and now having an opportunity to relearn and rediscover Edinburgh: it is a fascinating, rich and lots of opportunities for the festival to develop its relationship with the people of the city.\"For the festival, the new strand of work allows it to stage smaller works, which are maybe too intricate or pricey for a risky run at the Fringe, but are not the expansive EIF shows which audiences have come to expect in the last  years in size, scale and budget.Linehan said: ldquoOne of the things we realised, we did feel there is a certain type of midscale work, that is more geographically erse than what we have been doing.ldquoThey cannot play on the Fringe, because they are too complex and too expensive. Itrsquos not an opera company, or a huge European theatre company, but we are kind of missing it. So we wanted to put that in. And so that has created this ndash these are not necessarily huge pieces - but there is a block in the middle there of midscale work that is all quite socially engaged. It also gives it much more of a geographical reach, much more geographical erse, and it is a little less Eurocentric.\"Linehan says that the new programming allows for artists such as Rou or the choreographer Serge Aime Coulibaly t come to the EIF: Coulibaly is presenting Kalakuta Republik, a work inspired by the music and le of Fela Kuti.He says: \"Milo Rou, the most talked about European director at the moment, Serge Coulibaly, again, one of the most talked about directors: these guys yoursquod never see them at the Fringe.\"They wouldnrsquot set up a tent for % of the box office at the Fringe and give it a go. There was always a thing in Edinburgh actually. Do you define the Fringe versus International festival by dint of scale  That always created something of a gap, with a whole range of artists, who didnrsquot necessarily want to do big, big work, but whose work was complex and they were still senior artists. It meant that a lot of artists were just not coming through here.\"Linehan said that The Departure Lounge series, led by Greig, may also point to new material for the festival in the future. In a sense, the festival itself may be generating new shows through this years activities.He said: \"All of these things are piloting how we might be able to use the festival beyond the lsquoCome in and do your four performances, and well get you back out to the airport.rsquoSo, I ask, it is a way of generating its own material in some way He says: \"Well, generating its own material but also using a combination of the artists, people here in Edinburgh, and people of a shared interest, to be able to talk about things. But within the framework of some kind of performance or social event. Rather than a much more passive event, like a talk.\"This years new programming will be an experiment, and, it seems, a template for further evolution of the EIF.McGrath added: \"How incredible is Edinburgh that  writers from  countries can, over the course of a month, have a conversation with people from the city, locals and visitors, about what a manesto for the future will look like \"By the end of the month, they will have collectively created some kind of aspirational manesto for the future: we shall see what happens. But it seems like a brilliant starting point for a lot of interesting conversations.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  As May goes down for the third time  the road to Brexit just got a whole lot longer","story":"The Prime Minister has behaved asshe had a thumping Commons majority when in fact she is a minority leader of an unstable coalition.

True enough in England and Wales, but not in Scotland, which voted overwhelmingly to remain within the EU.Mr Redfern stretches credulity to the limit with his argument that Scotland is being listened to by Westminster. Who is listening  Theresa May and her government have spent almost three years contemptuously ignoring the Remain vote in Scotland, and there is a noticeable lack of respect shown by MPs to the SNPs Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and his colleagues when they speak in Parliament, even though the SNP holds  seats out of Scotlands quota of .So, there may be a majority in the Commons at odds with the Leave vote, but that in no way suggests that MPs have any real interest in or respect for Scotland frankly, they dont give a damn.Ruth Marr,StirlingAs a believer in fulfilling democratic decisions and someone who voted to leave the EU, my response to remainers who are expressing near apoplectic joy at the size of the parliamentary petition to revoke Article  and remain in the EU is this.After all the names of those who are ineligible to vote, including those from Russia, China, North Korea, Europe and where in the world, have been removed from the petition and the total of genuine voters comes to . million+, I will then take it seriously.Paul LewisEdinburghHow can anyone contemplate voting Conservative ever again  No doubt matters will have moved on by the time this is printed but as I writeit is reported that certain ldquoleading Conservative MPs will offer to support the Prime Ministerrsquos Brexit proposalsshe gives an early date for her resignation.They are showing that they have no interest in any concept of whether her ideas are good or bad for the people of the UK countries.

By merely trying to engineer the worst possible scenario Brexit ndash again to please their far-out wing ndash they may well help bring about a general election.The people of Scotland did not forgive them in  for being unable to see beyond the end of their noses and it is highly likely they will pay a high political price for their one issue obsessiveness a second time.Alexander McKayEdinburghDavid Leask rightly offers the local residents of Glen Etive a chance to speak out against the opposition by wild land proponents who would deny any future development of the human population in a beautul place .A glance at the depopulation of Argyll and Inverness-shire since the late th century by the introduction of sheep ranching and deer stalking tells how much of the glen and Loch Etive-side was made into a manmade wilderness. Well-sculpted hydro as approved by Highland Council will soon blend in.However, a st-century debate on landscape justice is being fronted in Glasgow by Inherit, the Institute for Heritage  Sustainable Human Development.

She is from Haute-Savoie in France and growing up in the countryside, farming and foraging were her way of le. She will never pass by a field of Dandelions, wild berries or wild garlic without stopping and pulling out a pocketkne to gather the fresh plants or fruits. I spent my whole childhood eating freshly picked wild herbs in our lunches that she would prepare for us - it was always delicious.Growing up in Geneva, we were lucky to have a garden where Mom would grow all of our own produce. We enjoyed it fresh, throughout the summer months but we also saved enough for the winter so that we could enjoy the vegetables all year round. We spent most of our family holidays in our house near the sea in the South of France where we would eat freshly caught fish, quickly seared to make the most of the incredible flavour.Wild garlic, or lsquoail de lrsquooursrsquo as we call it in French, is a magical plant that brings sunshine into food after a long dark winter. I always see it as a sign of spring arriving when we can start to find wild leaves in the nearby countryside. This dish is dedicated to my Mom as it reminds me of joyous memories with her, eating fresh fish and picking wild herbs.For more information about Le Roi Fou, visit https:leroou .Serves Ingredients: gurnard filletsOlive oil, for fryingSalt and pepperFor the fish stock:g fish bones and trimmingsg white mirepoix g mushrooms, dicedl water lemon, juice onlySalt and pepperFor the sauce:ml dry white wineml double cream small shallot, finely choppedml fish stock tbsp Noilly PratSalt and freshly ground pepper wild garlic leaves, cut into fine stripsTo serve:Wild garlic leavesSpring greensNew potatoes, steamed.

Itrsquos the perfect way to enjoy a special dinner but without having to spend hours in the kitchen. The ingredients are a signal to me that spring is on the horizon with the fresh and delicious flavours of lamb, tomatoes and broad beans. Using soft herbs to create the crust takes it to the next level for a Sunday roast and there is a lovely touch of indulgence with the cream and butter in the dauphinoise potatoes.In our house, we like to get the children involved by peeling the potatoes and shelling the beans. This means that they feel included in the cooking and that theyrsquore also getting to help prepare the special meal for Mum. Many of the elements of the dish can be prepared in advance such as the herb crust, dauphinoise potatoes and tomato puree so it makes cooking on the day super quick and simple.For more information about the Gleneagles, visit https:www.gleneagles  or call the reservations team on  .Serves Ingredients:For the lamb: x  bone racks of lamb, French trimmed slices of bread, crusts removed and blended into a crumbml Scottish rapeseed oilg thyme leaves, choppedg parsley, stalks removed and finely choppedg Parmesan, finely gratedg Dijon mustardSalt and pepperFor the dauphinoise potatoes:kg waxy potatoes, peeled and sliced thinlyml full fat milkml double cream cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed sprigs of thymeSalt and pepperFor the roasted tomato sauce:g cherry tomatoesml red wine vinegarg caster sugarml olive oil garlic clove, peeled and crushedSalt and pepperFor the broad beans:g frozen broad beansg butterml waterg mint leaves, finely choppedSalt and pepperMethod:. First, prepare the lamb. Season the meat with salt and pepper and add the lamb to a cold frying pan. Place the pan on the hob and set to a low to medium heat. As the pan warms it will slowly melt the fat. Let the lamb slowly cook on the fat side until you get a nice golden colour and a crispy piece of fat. Turn the heat up a little and sear the other side of the lamb so that it is coloured all over. Take the lamb out the pan and transfer to a roasting tray, ready for cooking.. In a frying pan, heat the oil and add the breadcrumb. Stir everything together to coat the crumb in oil and season with salt and pepper. Fry the crumbs until golden and crispy. Take the pan off the heat and leave to cool before adding the herbs and Parmesan. Brush the lamb on the fat covered side with Dijon mustard then coat in the herb crumbs.. Next, prepare the dauphinoise potatoes. Toss the potato slices in a bowl with a sprinkling of salt. Add the cream, milk, garlic and thyme to a large pan and bring up to a boil, turn off the heat and leave to infuse for around  minutes. Squeeze the potatoes to remove any excess water, rinse the bowl andthe potatoes. Pour the cream mixture through a sieve onto the potatoes and season as required. Line a deep baking tray with greaseproof paper and place the potatoes into the baking tray in layers so you get a unorm depth, pouring some of the cream between each of the layers. Cover with greaseproof paper and tin foil and bake in the oven at degC for around  to  minutes. You will be able to tell the potatoes are cooked by inserting a skewer into the middle,there is no resistance they are ready.. Next, make the roasted tomato sauce.

Season as required.. Next, prepare the broad beans. Let the broad beans defrost then squeeze the beans out of the pod. Add the butter and water into a small pan and bring to the boil. Add the beans and cook on a high heat for  minutes or until the water has evaporated and they are coated in butter. Add the seasoning and the chopped mint and stir well to combine everything together.. To cook the lamb, preheat the oven to degC. Cook the lamb for  to  minutes depending on how pink you like it. Once cooked, remove from the oven and just cover with foil. Leave to rest for  minutes before carving into cutlets.. To serve, cut a disk of the dauphinoise potatoes and top with the lamb cutlets. Add the broad beans and the tomato puree to the plate and serve.The Shepherdrsquos DelightMisty Isle Ginrsquos signature cocktailIsle of Skye Distillers is the first gin and vodka distillery on the Isle of Skye.

This would see us remain in the European Economic Area via membership of EFTA with the UK entering into a comprehensive customs arrangement with the EU. This would deliver frictionless trade and, critically, solve issues around the Irish border because there would be no need for any new regulatory frontier there.Common Market . respects both the outcome of the  referendum but also the closeness of the result. It has the benefit of being an off-the-shelf solution which the EU could agree to immediately, especially when time is in short supply. We would still require a Withdrawal Agreement and the Northern Irish ldquobackstop, but the latter would become academic once we have accessed EFTA. The ldquoPolitical Declaration would be redrafted accordingly to reflect a future relationship with the EU similar to Norwayrsquos.We would exit the Common Fisheries Policy, the Common Agricultural Policy, and the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice. We would remain outside the Schengen \"open borders\" regime.

EFTA countries are in fact involved in major EU ldquodecision-shaping mechanisms as well as having participation rights in a number of EU programmes and organisations.

The British Government tried to dismiss us as a small issue among other big issues.\"The main problem for me and my community is the free movement of people, whether to work, study or trade.\"The Commons is due to hold a second round of indicative votes tomorrow on alternatives to Mayrsquos plan amid warnings that Westminster is rapidly running out of time to resolve the crisis.With the Prime Minister determined to bring back her deal for a fourth time, Nicky Morgan saidMPs were able to coalesce around one of the alternatives it may need a unity government to implement it.ldquoIf the Government refused and Theresa May felt she could not implement what Parliament had identied as a way of leaving the EU, then I think we would have to think very hard about whether a cross-party coalition, group of people, whatever, could do that in order to make sure that the UK does leave the EU in an orderly fashion, she told the BBC.The former education secretary ndash touted as a possible ldquounity prime minister ndash added: ldquoIt may well be thatyou end up with a cross-party approach to finding a majority in the House of Commons it might be that you need a cross-party approach to implementing it.ldquoThere have been periods in our history when we have had national unity governments or a coalition for a very specic issue.Her comments came after Labour deputy leader Tom Watson suggested the time had come for a national unity government.In an interview with Prospect magazine, he said: ldquoI prefer Labour governments and I hope we never get to a point where our economy or security is so in peril that we get a government of national unity.But he added: ldquoIf needs must, we have to then do whatrsquos right.There appeared to be little enthusiasm for the prospect among those around Jeremy Corbyn. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ldquoIrsquom not sure thatrsquos going to be the solution.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis also rejected the idea, insisting Mayrsquos deal was still the best way to deliver an orderly withdrawal from the EU.Lewis made clear the Government remained opposed to the option which came closest to a majority in the first round of votes on Wednesday ndash a proposal by veteran Tory Ken Clarke for a customs union.ldquoThere would be a huge number of people around the country who would understandably take the view that doesnrsquot respect thevote of  and it goes against our partyrsquos manesto, he said.In this weekrsquos indicative votes, the SNP did not support the Clarke plan, a proposal that was narrowly defeated.In an article for this newspaper, Blackford said retaining EU membership is ldquoby far the best deal of all and stopping Brexit ldquomust be the priority. However, he argued that the SNP will ldquocontinue our talks across the parties and, in the event that Brexit goes ahead, wrote that ldquoprotecting our membership of the single market and customs union would be crucial.He added: ldquoWhile I have limited confidence in Westminster to act in Scotlandrsquos interests ndash the SNP will do everything we can to reach out, build consensus, and find a way out of this crisis.Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is under renewed pressure from the Brexiter wing of the party after she said it was ldquoalmost certain that there would have to be an extended delay to Brexither deal does not go through.Following the defeat on Friday, she warned the Commons would not allow Britain to leave without a deal on April  ndash the new deadline set by the EU.Any signicant extension beyond that date would require Britain to take part in elections in May to the European Parliament.A newspaper report claimed that  Tory MPs had now written to the Prime Minister demanding the UK leaves within the next few months and insisting it cannot take part in the European elections.The letter was said to have been signed by  members of the Cabinet ndash including Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Sajid Javid ndash and  other ministers.Lewis said: ldquoI havenrsquot signed the letter. I do know about it. I havenrsquot seen the full text of the letter and I havenrsquot seen the signatures on it.ldquoMy view is that we should be doing everything we can to leave the European Union in good order as quickly as we can. I think the deal is the right way to do that.ldquoWe must do everything we can to ensure we do not fight the European elections. None of us wants to do that.In another development, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the Tory Government of ldquorunning down the clock and ldquobullying and threatening MPs in order to force through Mayrsquos Brexit deal.He also refused to say whether his party would offer an option to remain in the European Union during a second round of indicative votes in the House of Commons tomorrow.Corbyn was speaking from Newport in South Wales yesterday as he joined Labour candidate Ruth Jones ahead of the Newport West by-election next week.AskedLabourrsquos indicative vote would include an option of giving the public a confirmatory referendum on any Brexit deal, Corbyn said: ldquoThat is the Labour position so far but there hasnrsquot been enough support for that across the floor in the House of Commons.ldquoBut the absolute priority atthe moment is to end this chaos the Government has brought us to by their endlessly running down the clock and basically bullying and threatening people.ldquoThe bullying hasnrsquot worked the threats hasnrsquot worked.

The frequency and the duration of the calls even tops the ones made on New Yearrsquos and Valentinersquos Day, showing just how much people value their mums.. Nearly every language in the world has a similar word for mother: The word ldquomama is recognised almost universally ndash and around the world it is often among the first words babies speak. It was Russian Linguist Roman Jakobson who tried to explain the words usage in a study titled \"Mama and Papa\". He said that as babies experiment with speaking, they often make the easiest sounds available to them ndash ldquommm and ldquoaah. When this is repeated, it starts to form something close to ldquoma-ma ndash a huge source of pride to every mum, even though the baby is actually wanting fed."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-on-sunday-tells-mps-to-choose-something-as-brexit-teeters-on-brink","story":"With No Deal looming as large as at any time in the process, The Herald on Sunday decided it was time to speak out, to demand that MPs set aside party politics and personal power games and work together ndash for the good of everyone.Our take on the famous Trainspotting lsquoChoose Lersquo poster is a simple and very striking way to get the message across ndash and itrsquos the perfect introduction to a hard-hitting Brexit report inside.As well as our own analysis of what should happen in the coming days and weeks, and news of a day of protest and recrimination across the country, we have exclusive comment articles from SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, Scottish Tory MP Donald Cameron and, of course, Iain Macwhirter.Brexit Comment:"},{"url":null,"title":"food-industry-chief-terrified-of-no-deal-brexit-leading-to-tariffs","story":"Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said a no-deal Brexit would cause ldquoenormous amounts of disruption and enormous amounts of dficulty for its members.He told BBC Breakfast: ldquoThe real problem here is that the disruption that we would have from no deal would very quickly lead to empty shelves, it would lead to more expensive products, and it would lead to a real diminution of choice ndash particularly for people in poorer areas and at the end of distribution chains.Mr Wright said most of the federationrsquos members would be ldquohorried by the imposition of tarfs on EU trade, adding: ldquoIrsquom absolutely terried of the prospects for our economy and our food and drink industry by the prospect of tarfs.ldquoIt will cause enormous amounts of disruption and enormous amounts of dficulty.Brexit-supporting Wetherspoons founder Tim Martin highlighted that leaving the EU will allow the UK to lt existing tarfs on trade with countries outside the bloc.ldquoWersquoll have far less tarfs on New Zealand wine, on rice, on oranges, on bananas, he told the broadcaster.ldquoIf we leave the EU without a deal the number of tarfs will be vastly reduced."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-landmarks-switch-off-lights-for-earth-hour","story":"The lights went out at famous buildings between .pm and .pm as part of the international event organised by conservation charity WWF to urge action to save the planet.More than , cities in over  countries were estimated to take part in this yearrsquos Earth Hour.ICYMI: Check out the @EmpireStateBldg participating in #EarthHour! pic bDHdvwAQmdash World Wildle FundMarch , ## Voici comment jexprime mon##pour la#en eacuteteignant mon eacuteclairage.## Here we go, showing my#for the#turning my lights off. #EarthHour #tourEfel #Efeltower pic hVJXaTVmdash La tour EfelMarch , "},{"url":null,"title":"performance-dear-europe-swg3-glasgow-four-stars","story":"Dear EuropeSWG, GlasgowNeil CooperFour starsItrsquos Friday night, five minutes after the UK failed to leave the EU as planned.

Waste cooking oil, lubricant oil and garden waste would need to be taken to  Bossack.Businesses wishing to do this should note they would need to register as a waste carrier with SEPA . There is currently no charge for this for many businesses.It’s also important businesses understand they need to register with the council ahead of taking waste or recycling to Bossack or Chinglebraes, to avoid delays at the gate — or possibly being turned away.Businesses can set up a trade waste and or recycling collection service with the council.Darren Richardson is the council’s head of infrastructure services. He said: “We’re issuing these reminders now to help businesses avoid falling foul of SEPA and possibly incurring fines.“Equally, we’re keen to spread the word amongst businesses that recycling where possible is not only a legal requirement, but it can also save them money.“It’s far cheaper to separate out recyclates than it is to dispose of these items in general waste. It also contributes to the Zero Waste Plan for Scotland where targets proposed include recycling  per cent of all Scotland’s waste and only  per cent of remaining waste ending up in landfill by .“The situation is slightly dferent on the isles with regards to recycling — so we are writing separately to isles businesses.“We’re here to help all businesses and we’d encourage any local business, no matter the size, to contact usthey’re unsure about what they need to do or wish to establish a recycling or waste collection service with us.”Resources and information for businesses is regularly updated on the council’s website and any business, large or small, who is unsure of whether their waste and or recycling is classed as commercial waste should get in touch with the council’s Waste Team on .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The subsidy is unlawful state aid and it will disturb the market.”The company decided to go to Scotland’s highest civil court after an announcement from the Scottish Government last month. The ministers had decided to name three companies who are bidding to provide ferry services between Aberdeen and Orkney and Shetland.Final tenders for the contract are expected to be submitted by the end of April  and the successful firm will receive a subsidy estimated to be worth around £ million.Legal papers lodged in the case show that Pentland Ferries seeks a declarator from the court that the proposed subsidy is unlawful and breaches obligations placed upon the government by EU law.Today saw lawyers for the Scottish government argued that the ministers had acted lawfully.Having finished hearing from both sides, Lord Boyd said he’d issue his decision at some point in the near future.See next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian for the full story.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It may not be dficult to shine when you are surrounded by the kind of pantomime villains that have stalked the political stage for the past three and a half years. Nevertheless # in a morass of self-interest and lies # she has been the sole statesmanlike presence, prompting Remainers in England to gaze wistfully north.To some extent, of course, she has had it easier than her Conservative and Labour counterparts although, like them, the SNP has supporters on either side of the Brexit ide, she had no predominantly Leave constituencies to worry about. And because  per cent of Scotland voted to Remain, the argument about having to honour the democratic decision of the electorate has less resonance up here.Sturgeon had a broadly receptive audience for her principled pro-European, pro-immigration, anti-borders stance. Still, she spoke with passion and conviction, lting the tone of a debate that was mired in isive, xenophobic language, and rising above other parties’ unseemly political manoeuvrings.There were potential pit-falls for Sturgeon too but she mostly avoided them. From the get-go there was pressure from some supporters to name the date for a second indyref and pressure from others to hold off until it was winnable. Somehow, she has managed to send out the right signals at the right times to keep both camps on side though some may have felt she was stringing them along.There was also a danger that Sturgeon might seem too eager to profit from the rest of the UK’s pain. The harder the Brexit – one early theory posited – the more likely it was that Scots would want to break free. That theory no longer holds, but Sturgeon never appeared to gloat. Whatever personal hopes she harboured, she always seemed committed to securing the best outcome for the UK: ideally a u-turn failing that the softest possible Brexit.Her comparatively late backing of a People’s Vote could be regarded as opportunist but then again the climate had changed. What drowning person offered a stick wouldn’t grab it, especiallythey could take a sideswipe at Labour at the same time  In any case, it chimed with the mood of much of the country.So sure-footed has Sturgeon’s approach been, Labour MEP David Martin called her handling of Brexit “top drawer”.In the past few days however, the stress of parliamentary chaos appears to have been taking its toll on her party. As the \u2028 April deadline approaches, and hopes of remaining in the EU begin to falter, there has been a hint of panic and political clumsiness. The unity which is such an integral part of the party’s brand seemed strained.On Wednesday, MPs Pete Wishart and Angus MacNeil defied the whip to abstain from the indicative vote on a People’s Vote on the grounds that it might lead to calls for a second confirmatory vote in the event of a successful indyref.And then the SNP MPs abstained on Ken Clarke’s proposal for a customs union. If they hadn’t, the amendment would have passed.According to SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, Clarke’s proposal would not guarantee freedom of movement and so was of no benefit to Scotland. But the abstentions brought accusations of intransigence and disingenuousness. After all, hadn’t Sturgeon previously spoken of securing a “common sense Brexit”  They were also portrayed as counterproductive it is now clear that, while a hard Brexit might sharpen the appetite for independence, a hard border at Gretna Green would make it more dficult to deliver.Perhaps, like so many of us, the SNP is in denial. Perhaps it is psychologically incapable of accepting  April will ever come perhaps it still believes the Brexiteers will suddenly see the error of their ways. Or perhaps it is right and there is still a chance of reversing the result. Last night, MP Joanna Cherry confirmed she had tabled a reworked version of her Revoke Article  amendment. Under the reworked version,the EU refuses a further extension, and there is no time for a referendum, Parliament would be forced to choose between a No Deal and revoking, with a commitment to a public inquiry to establish what people want.At the same time, Stuart Hosie has joined MPs from other parties to sign the Nick Boles amendment which would keep the UK in both the customs union and the single market. But the SNP MPs are not yet committed to voting in favour of it.Scottish Labour paid such a high price for sharing an indyref  with the Tories, the SNP may be wary of cross-party collaboration. The problem is everyone involved is playing a dangerous game with the highest of stakes the rules are hazy and malleable and no-one knows who is bluffing. Leave it too long and May’s deal might pass or, worse still, we might end up with No Deal.Last week – on the th anniversary of the fall of the Callaghan government – Jeremy Corbyn sent out a tweet reminding the world the SNP had put down the vote of no confidence and voted with the Tories thus the party bears a proportion of the blame for ushering in  years of Thatcherism.It was a crass gesture at a time when Labour is so catastrophically failing as a credible opposition. It said more about Corbyn’s lack of class than a decision taken when Sturgeon was still in primary school.Yet, it does serve as a cautionary tale of how easy it is to find yourself on the wrong side of history and the way in which the consequences of one  move can ripple down the years.As the SNP heads into next week, it will have to tread cautiously. If a second referendum or the revocation of article  is still achievable, then it is right to pursue that option.But, witnessing the scenes on Parliament Square on Friday night, it is increasingly dficult to imagine a majority of politicians will be willing to backtrack on Brexit and risk unleashing God knows what ision and mayhem on our streets.If, in the end, the choice is binary – May’s deal or a customs union, with or without freedom of movement – it would be folly for the SNP MPs to abstain again.Voting with Labour MPs to secure a softer Brexit could at least be offered up as a victory of sorts allowing May’s deal to pass would cast a long, dark shadow the party might find dficult to escape.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm election gets my vote to end brexit farce","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Things cannot go on like this. The United Kingdom is becoming a laughing stock.For those of us who believe Brexit to be a colossal mistake, an act of foolish national self-harm, the fact that the nation did not depart the EU on Friday may have come as something of a relief, but anyone who believes we are on the brink of reversing the result of the  referendum is surely kidding themselves. : Dani Garavelli: Nicola Sturgeon’s halo may slip in Brexit’s last actRather, the third defeat for Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal increases the risk of the UK crashing out of Europe with a painful No Deal Brexit. Having secured from the EU a brief delay to the UK’s departure, May has until  April to find a majority in the House of Commons for her orce deal. If she fails, then we are out on our arses without any kind of agreement. A statement from the European Commission makes this perfectly clear. In the aftermath of the PM’s latest parliamentary humiliation, an EC spokesman said: “The Commission regrets the negative vote in the House of Commons today. A ‘no-deal’ scenario on  April is now a likely scenario. The EU is now fully prepared for a ‘no-deal’ scenario at midnight on  April.”Furthermore, lest anyone be in any doubt, departure terms without Commons support for May’s deal would be much worse than with.“The benefits of the Withdrawal Agreement, including a transition period, will in no circumstances be replicated in a ‘no-deal’ scenario. Sectoral mini-deals are not an option,” said the spokesman.Doubtless, dedicated Eurosceptics will already have convinced themselves that this is a hollow threat, that the EU is still ready to capitulate to the UK’s demandsonly we would all “believe” in Britain. Or maybe they’re of the full-on masochist iety, the types who believe No Deal Brexit is the very best possible outcome.Fortunately, a majority of MPs have voted against countenancing such a possibility. No Deal is very much a minority interest at Westminster.But all of that means nothingMPs can’t reach some kind of consensus before a week on Friday. The EU need not – and will not – respect the view of the parliamentary majoritywe reach  April without an agreement on a way forward. MPs cannot vote against reality.And so we need something signicant to happen. Simply hoping that MPs who are now utterly ided are going to come together in the next  days is the stuff of fantasy.There are those who yearn for a second referendum – a so-called “People’s Vote” – to put this issue to bed, once and for all. This – the preferred option of many Remainer MPs – would, in theory, break the deadlock. Of course – and I am hardly going to criticise them for this because I share their desire – what these MPs want is for the UK to take the opportunity to change its mind and vote Remain.Assuming, not unreasonably, that, having rejected the Prime Minister’s deal three times, MPs are not clamouring to approve it in a fourth vote, there appear to be three routes forward. Either MPs argue among themselves until, inevitably, the UK leaves the EU without a deal on  April or Theresa May pushes the button on either a second referendum or a general election.In order for either of those two options to take place, the PM will have to secure a further delay to Brexit from the UK’s European counterparts. There is no guarantee that the EU, having been messed around for almost three years, would agree to such a development, but May must try.As a determined Remainer, I enjoy the fantasy of a second referendum ending up with a decisive victory for my side and for all of this to be left in the past where it may be regarded as a temporary aberration, a mistake that we rectied before it was too late.But, looking at the Commons’ decision-making on this issue – and the massive pressure on the PM from Eurosceptic colleagues and Conservative Party members – it looks to be a vanishingly unlikely scenario.The argument that it would be undemocratic to hold a second referendum because one doesn’t like the outcome of the first carries some weight. It certainly chimes with Brexiteers who, much as it might pain me to admit it, have a point. After all, none of us who voted in the  referendum believed that the decision of the majority would not be upheld. And so, surely, the best possible option would be for the UK to go to the polls again.If the current House of Commons cannot reach some kind of agreement, how  are we to move forward Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has, for some time, been calling for a general election. The Labour fantasy is that they will defeat the Tories in this election and then agree with the EU a better departure deal than the one achieved by the Prime Minister.Wishful thinking is doing a lot of heavy carrying in the logic behind this proposal. Despite the utterly dysal nature of the Tory Party, Corbyn’s Labour languishes behind it in the polls. Another election might well see the Tories restore their parliamentary majority.But this is neither here nor there. We cannot go on like this andthe only way of freeing up the Commons to act is to install new members, then what better option is there Of course, it is perfectly possible that, after a general election, we end up with a House of Commons that is similarly ided on this issue, that simply cannot find some way forward, but that cannot be a reason not to go down this road.Remainers may take some comfort from the fact that Friday’s original Brexit day passed without us leaving the EU, but we are kidding ourselveswe think dragging things out like this is a permanent solution.It’s time for political parties to bring forward manesto pledges based on the reality, as we now see it, of Brexit. Otherwise, we simply cannot avoid the No Deal Brexit so many of us fear.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit new poll gives boost to scottish independence plans","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...TWO thirds of Scots who are \"undecided\" about independence, believe Brexit makes it more likely - and more than half would be more likely to vote Yes in a second independence referendumBritain leaves the EU without a deal, according to a new poll.Results from the first Progress Scotland poll - a company set up by former SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson and independent polling expert Mark Dfley - suggest that Brexit is radically changing Scots views on independence. According to the new figures, the issue of EU membership has gone from being of concern to just  per cent of voters at the time of the  independence vote, to being the main concern at  per cent - above the economy and the NHS.And the poll, of more than  people, found that of those \"undecided\" on independence,  per cent now believe Brexit will make it more likely, with just  per cent disagreeing. It also found that  per cent of formerly undecided voters have changed their view on independence as a result of Brexit.And while  per cent of the same cohort say they will wait to see the impact of Brexit before deciding how they would vote in any new independence referendum, that changed to  per cent saying they would be more likely to back independence in the event of a no deal Brexit.The polling will give a boost to those in the independence movement who have been agitating for a second referendum. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she will reveal what her next steps will be on a second indyref in a matter of weeks.However when all those polled were asked, on a sliding scale, where they stood on Scottish independence only  per cent said they “completely supported” the idea, with  per cent saying they “completely supported staying in the UK”.Mark Dfley, who designed the questions for the poll said: “Since June , politics across the UK has been dominated by the issue of Brexit. It is therefore unsurprising that, on the day that the UK had been due to leave the EU, new polling highlights the pivotal role that the issue of EU membership and Brexit is likely to play in any future Scottish independence referendum.“The importance of the EU as an issue which drives opinion on independence has doubled  per cent of voters put EU membership in the top two or three issues which determined their vote in . Now, that figure is  per cent making it the single most important issue for voters in another referendum.\"He added that the provides evidence of how the issue of the EU might impact on voters who have no firm position on the independence question. \"The poll suggests that this cohort of ‘open-minded’ Scots has both strong views on the EU and is reassessing its views on independence in light of the Brexit debate,\" he said.Progress Scotland Managing Director Angus Robertson said: “These findings illustrate the signicant impact that Brexit is having on the views of open-minded people towards Scottish independence. These are just the initial findings from the inaugural large-scale opinion poll for Progress Scotland and more results will follow.\"This is just the beginning of our work, which over time will allow us to better understand an ever growing number of people in Scotland who are open-minded towards independence.\"SNP depute leader Keith Brown welcomed the research, which he said shows that people are “open to changing their view on independence” as a result of Brexit.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp dual strategy backs softest brexit and people s vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scottish Government ministers and officials are examining the detail of proposals for a #Common Market .# exit from the European Union in a bid to reach a compromise on Brexit tomorrow.MPs will hold a second round of votes on alternative Brexit plans on Monday, after the government’s Withdrawal Agreement was defeated for a third time on Friday.One of the proposals, put forward by the Conservative backbencher Nick Boles, has been scrutinised in Edinburgh over the weekend, Scotland on Sunday was told.The SNP added its support to the cross-party Boles plan following Friday’s vote, to help ensure that it is selected for debate and vote by Commons Speaker John Bercow tomorrow.None of the eight options put before MPs in a previous round of votes on Wednesday received a majority, with Common Market . emerging as the third most popular option after falling by  votes.However, the SNP was criticised for abstaining on the Boles plan despite it holding out the prospect of the UK remaining within the EU customs and single market regimes – objectives set out in the Scottish Government’s own Brexit policy document Scotland’s Place In Europe.The SNP said it withheld its support because of a lack of clarity in the text of the Boles motion about the depth of the UK’s future customs relationship with the EU, and because it cast doubt on the continuation of the free movement of people.Wording of the motion has now been changed to remove any qualication on free movement and specying the need for “frictionless agri-food trade” between the UK and EU.Boles said: “[I] strongly welcome this indication of SNP support for Common Market ..“We have modied the motion in response to their concerns. I hope they feel able to vote for it on Monday.”The Tory MP has been in talks with Scottish parliamentarians including ones in the SNP since last year, as Scotland on Sunday reported in November.Paul Masterton, the Scottish Tory MP who resigned as a parliamentary ministerial aide to vote for a delay to Brexit earlier this month, voted for the Boles plan on Wednesday.An SNP source said the party was not guaranteed to vote for the Boles plan tomorrow, but wanted it to emerge as the top “soft Brexit” proposal, ahead of a plan put forward by fellow Tory backbencher Kenneth Clarke, which only suggests customs union membership without the single market. It was defeated by just six votes.However, the nationalists believe they are now in a position to either prevent Brexit or force a second EU referendum. They will focus their efforts on those aims in the two weeks before a crucial Brussels summit that will likely see a further long delay until the end of the year forced on Theresa May.Ahead of tomorrow’s votes, the SNP MP Joanna Cherry has also put forward a revised plan to revoke Article  and stop Brexit entirelya no-deal scenario becomes inevitable.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp many labour mps want to back our plan to revoke article 50","story":"The SNP MP behind a revised plan to revoke Article a no-deal scenario seems inevitable has said she has been approached by #many# Labour MPs who want to back it.Joanna Cherry QC said she has been working closely with some Labour politicians to find a more “palatable” way of wording the proposal.Scottish Labour MP Paul Sweeney has suggested that he and others are “sympathetic” to the idea, which he described as a “sensible safeguard”.MPs are preparing to take control of the Commons timetable with a second series of “indicative” votes on Brexit, starting on Monday, in a bid to find a plan which can command a majority in the House.Ms Cherry has confirmed that she has tabled a fresh version of her motion that calls for Article  - the mechanism for leaving the European Union - to be revoked in certain circumstances.Under the reworked motion,the UK gets to April , the date of a European Council summit, without a deal, an extension to Article  will be sought.If that extension is not granted, the UK Government would then be mandated to put a vote on no deal before the Commons.Ms Cherry told BBC Scotland: “We’re confident that that will be defeated, and the motion goes on to say thatthe vote for no deal is defeated, the Government must revoke Article .” - Theresa May warned: You cannot ignore the will of parliamentThe reworked version also provides for a public inquiry to be set up within three months of revocation to look at Britain’s future relationship with the EU and whether a majority can get behind it.Ms Cherry said the proposal has been tabled for Monday, although it will be up to the Speaker to decide which motions are selected.Speaking on the Sunday Politics Scotland programme, she said: “I’ve worked very closely with some Labour MPs who didn’t feel able to support the way it was worded last time to craft it into a form that’s more palatable for them.”The MP continued: “I don’t knowLabour are going to whip for it yet, but I have been proactively approached by many Labour MPs who didn’t vote for it last time who want to support it this time round.”Asked whether Labour as a whole could support the plan put forward by Ms Cherry, Mr Sweeney responded: “Well we’re sympathetic to it, but we’ll see what happens next week.“I think it’s certainly a very sensible safeguard.”On Labour’s way forward, he told the show: “It’s about building a coalition that is going to come together and actually establish a majority for a way forward in Parliament.“We are clear that some of the compromise options around a customs union and Common Market ., as it’s known, is a clear runner. But we also want to make sure that any deal is subject to a confirmatory public vote.”On the question of whether a reasonably long extension to Article  is now “inevitable”, he said: “I think it is inevitable.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work.

It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind @Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting.Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners.At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go.How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy.Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust.Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn.Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were.

The Newsboys were down to nine men, after two red cards. “A rough element entered into the game and many of the Dromore team were roughly handled, resulting in injury in some cases,” reported The Leader.John ‘Bronco’ Lane equalised for the Amateurs, and just when it looked like Dromore would grab a winner, “the Newsboys resorted to desperate tactics, a Dromore man losing two teeth in a melee”.The game finished - with the Amateurs also reduced to nine men.Afterwards, at a special meeting, the committee decided the club would end its participation in the Northern Amateur League “as the safety of the players had to be the first consideration”.The team on that fateful day was: R Lindsay, C Lindsay, A Brown, R McMurray, R Gracey, A Davidson, R Ervine, J Lane, C Donaldson, J Donaldson, C Bingham.The next year,  , the Amateurs gained admission to the Lisburn and District Amateur Football League ‘A’ Section, winning the league and two other cups in their debut season.Back-to-back league titles and a thrilling victory in cup finalIt’s a era of the Amateurs which is still fondly remembered today – the early s when Dromore was one of the top Junior teams in the country.Having spent seven seasons in the Lisburn and District Amateur Football League, the Mountview Park men moved back to the Northern Amateur League, B, for the   season.It was to prove a successful switch – the Amateurs sweeping all before them in a devastating march to the league crown.Goals, goals, goals ... the Amateurs knocked them in for fun and racked up some impressive scorelines: The Vale , Courtaulds , Blue CircleGreenisland , Queen’s University Seconds , Courtaulds , St Nicholasand Michelin .In February , a - blitz on Loughview FC took Dromore’s goal tally to  with five games left.

A convoy of back taxis turned up to take the delegates to the club where a night of craic and inclusivity ensued.“It’s a mental story, you couldn’t make it up,” says Kabosh Director Paula McFetridge inbetween ‘tech’ rehearsals on Monday afternoon.“The majority of people don’t know this story, very few people actually remember it. It was two years after the hunger strike and you have to remember there were check-points in the city centre, barricades.“Belfast was a ring of steel. Some of the delegates that came up to the Marty Forsythe that night couldn’t get back to the Student Union and stayed in houses, had their breakfast and left later that day.”Paula said the idea for the céilí was the brainchild of veteran republican Joe Austin who met with the club’s committee at the time and proposed it.“A fleet of around eight black taxis were sent down to Queen’s to bring the delegates back up to West Belfast. We have two guys flying into Belfast on Wednesday night for the premiere who attended back in  and will make a presentation to the community. You had delegates from Ireland and UK coming to attend the conference and being met with Paisley’s ‘Save Ulster From Sodomy’ campaign. The welcome was much warmer in this community club.”Starring in the production as one of the Manchester delegates, Gransha actor Brendan Quinn describes the piece and its themes “as very important in ”.“I’m from Gransha and my parents weren’t even aware of the story which is just crazy. The delegates were welcomed in, had a célií, had their breakfast the next day and were driven back down to Queen’s. I think the play is very relevant, even in  especially in terms of inequality. Northern Ireland is the only place where gay couples cannot legally get married – how far have we actually come since   Really not that far when you think about it. It’s a story that needs to be told and it’s a story done with such truth,” he said.Finaghy’s Simon Sweeney plays the youngest of the delegate group.“The character I play is only -years-old in the piece and since he’s under  he can be punished for being a gay man, he can be imprisoned. It’s a rock on his back he’s carrying the whole time.“The character I play wants to champion the change of law and that’s not being immediately discussed at the conference and he feels that he is not being represented, that comes up in the play and the character is then encouraged to see the bigger picture and not to be so selfish in his aims.”Being a young cast Brendan and Simon were encouraged by Paula to not play some of their scenes so “light”.“We don’t remember barricades, checkpoints, things that were so common during this time,” said Brendan. “Paula reminded that as well as the fun elements this is a serious play with important themes. It’s great to be a part of that.”A Queer Céilí at the Marty Forsythe will be performed at Trinity Lodge from Wednesday March  until Friday March .

Full UK-wide participation in the customs union and single market is acceptable to the DUP because it does not leave Northern Ireland aligned to the EU in isolation.It would maintain a soft border, debunking the persistent myth that the DUP wants a hard border.On Wednesday, the DUP opposed harder Brexit options - such as customs union membership alone - because it would not remove the backstop on which the May-EU withdrawal agreement rests.The DUP also rejected Labours fantasy option of membership of a customs union - asthere is an a la carte menu of such unions - in which the UK would miraculously continue to have the right to its own global trade deals and input to those of the EU.Belatedly, the dferences between the European Research Group - obsessed with Brexit - and the DUP - preoccupied only with Northern Irelands equal Brexit alongside the rest of the UK - have begun to be laid bare. Boris bin, ditch and junk the backstop Johnson wont be getting a repeat slot at the next DUP conference.Having used the event to launch his Conservative Party ascendancy, any fidelity to the DUP dissolved the moment Theresa May said \"support my backstop deal and theres a leadership vacancy\".Shameless is too inadequate a word.Et tu, Jacob Ill only changethe DUP moves Rees-Mogg, you changed as the DUP held steadfast. The DUP conference gig could have been yours, Jacob. I was looking forward to the first such gathering to be addressed in Latin.Many continue to criticise the DUP. The extensive support for the backstop across Northern Irelands business and farming communities shows a determination that economic logic ought to trump constitutional politics. Seamless access to EU and UK single markets matters, protecting livelihoods.To those at risk, this matters more than unproven claims that Northern Irelands unique alignment to the EU single market would be a constitutional betrayal, jeopardising the Union.In trying to persuade the DUP onside, the UK Government has made clear that it will not allow regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.In other words,EU single market regulations change, the Government will adopt them across the UK to protect Northern Irelands EU and UK trading relationships.The problem is that the DUP will not trust successor governments to honour that pledge.A certain mythology has developed over the seamlessness of Northern Irelands place in the UK single market.A reader, Alan Brookes, contacted me wondering how many people recalled that some British people from where in the UK could not work in Northern Ireland from  until  without a work permit.Such permitswere issued only to qualied essential workers, with notable exceptions such as members of the Armed Forces, religious ministers and teachers.Under the old Stormont regime, the Safeguard of Employment Act was designed to create local jobs for local workers. Brookes recalls his final interview with a Northern Ireland engineering firm in . \"When they asked did I need a work permit as I was born in England and I stated I did they immediately cooled and I was informed it would be too dficult\".There have long been checks on certain commodities travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and identication is always required.None of this has threatened the Union, but it has highlighted the distinctiveness of Northern Ireland.If the backstop worked well, it might possibly stem the rising demands of nationalists for constitutional change via a border poll and shore up the Union. After all, Northern Ireland only looks vaguely secure when it is economically prosperous and politically ing.Rarely, in other words.The DUPs intransigence has been matched by the EU steadfastly refusing to change a single word of the withdrawal agreement.There might be something faintly ridiculous about the chancelleries of Europe standing paralysed before Sammy Wilson, Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster, but its where we are.The DUP will never back the backstop in its current form. Amid all the noise, the party has at least been consistent, wanting a deal, but clear that no backstop removal equals no deal.What more can Theresa May do to sell her agreement given she has laid down her political le for the bargain  Rename it St Andrews perhaps The withdrawal agreement is as unsellable to the DUP as it is unchangeable for the EU. Mays promise to stand downher deal passes could be the longest resignation note in history. It is utterly irrelevant to the DUP. And the DUP do not fear a general election.Charting a way forward,the DUP does believe that UK-wide customs union and single market alignment to the EU solves the backstop conundrum, why not vote for it, rather than abstain,another opportunity arises For the DUP, its all about UKexit, not Brexit.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and co-author of books on the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party"},{"url":null,"title":"large pig farms could ruin game of thrones scenery says jerome flynn","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But the party machines could well remain in operation for another three weeks after that because a European election may be on the cards..pushThe DUP yesterday stated loud and clear that a year-long delay to Brexit - which would necessitate that EU election - is preferable to the Prime Ministers deal and the controversial backstop which the party insists threatens the Union. However staunch Brexiteers Sammy Wilson, Gregory Campbell et al may be, there is no contestthey have to choose between leaving the EU and protecting the Union - the latter will always win hands-down.Read MoreOne-year delay to Brexit would be better than backing May’s deal, insists DUP’s WilsonThere was wild speculation last week that the DUP could be brought around to supporting the Withdrawal Agreementit was bunged a few million more for Northern Ireland with the scrapping of air passenger duty and perhaps a big new road thrown in.Those observers have confused the partys confidence-and-supply agreement with its Brexit stance.Here was Mr Wilson on Sky News yesterday: \"We did not sign up to a confidence-and-supply agreement which would see Northern Ireland detached from the rest of the UK. That was never part of the deal and thats now where weve wandered towards because of the way in which the Prime Minister has conducted her negotiations.\"I dont think anyone would expect us - simply because were in a confidence-and-supply arrangement with them - to sign up to our own death warrant constitutionally.\"But while Theresa May has little chance of winning over the DUP, a softening of tone from some hardline Tory Eurosceptics is keeping her deal on le support.With MPs beginning to vote today on alternatives to the Withdrawal Agreement, there is a growing fear among Conservative Leave backbenchers that they could end up with no Brexit whatsoever or the softest of soft ones.Jacob Rees-Mogg has said that the Prime Ministers deal \"is better than not leaving at all\". Comments from Boris Johnson last night indicate thatMrs May announces she will step down soon, he might support her deal.If the vast majority of the ERG is scared into reluctantly backing the Withdrawal Agreement, along with enough Labour Brexiteers, there is a chance it could just scrape through the Commons on the third attempt. But the Prime Minister so far hasnt made her own luck and the odds remain against her.

round of indicative votes.The Prime Minister has, however, set her face firmly against a customs union, warning it runs counter to the Conservatives’ election manesto and would inhibit Britain’s ability to strike trade deals around the world.If she were to give way, she would provoke a furious reaction from Brexiteers, with International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling among the ministers reportedly ready to resign.Mr Gauke, meanwhile, said at the weekend that he would quitMrs May took Britain out of the EU without a deal, with other senior

A further invite to the programme providers and others to explain dferences in the terms and conditions for those employed in the Supporting People Programme.”UNISON has backed the workers throughout, and prior to the council meeting, urged elected members to support the motion.Yesterday, Niall McCarroll UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign has now taken a very positive step forward.Before the full council meeting UNISON held a Rally of Support for all frontline workers outside the NIHE offices, at the Richmond Chambers building.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMr McCarroll commented: “The purpose of this rally was to show all those who use supported living services and indeed the frontline workers that UNISON will be taking our campaign right to the front doors of all those statutory bodies with responsibility within the Supporting People Programme, demanding they start to value, service users, workers and indeed working class communities.“UNISON Community Branch activists worked closely with Independent Councillor Darren O’Reilly and Sinn Fein Councillor Patricia Logue in ensuring that the motion was not just aspirational but also radical in its core aims, this has now become the corporate position of DCSDC with regards the UNISON motion and we thank both councillors for their time and solidarity.“When council re convenes after the upcoming elections a delegation of UNISON Community Branch frontline workers will be invited by Council to give a presentation detailing their concerns, experiences and how they are struggling to survive both economically and socially, whilst completing specialist work supporting families and iniduals at risk.”‘Corporate greed’DCSDC will then invite the Department for Communities, Northern Ireland Housing Executive, Western Health and Social Care Trust, Regulation  Quality Improvement and all relevant employers within the City and District to provide further evidence which UNISON believes will further detail the crisis facing the Supporting People Programme and also “expose inequality and corporate greed, where it exists.”Mr McCarroll continued: “UNISON would like to put on record our gratitude to the elected representatives on DCSDC who supported the motion, a motion which clearly shouts out for social justice, equality, to uphold human rights and reflects solidarity to all frontline workers and those who need support and guidance through the Supporting People Programme.“The UNISON Community Branch Supporting People Campaign will now move into other working class communities across the North of Ireland, seeking support from the other  councils, gathering momentum, strength, power and influence as we ultimately reach a point that an independent review is commissioned or those choosing to block any review are removed from their positions by the trade union movement and radical campaigning involving ,working class communities.”L-R: Niall McCarroll , Councillor Darren OReilly and Saoirse Fanning and Sarah Jane OHara ."},{"url":null,"title":"showcase challenging new play holywell building","story":"CAPTION: Actors Paul ODoherty and Bernadette McFarland who will perform extracts from The Was is Now at the Holywell building on Bishop Street next Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"weeks foyle hospice draw result winner","story":"Winners in this weeks Foyle Hospice Draw are - £,, Karen Crumley£, Pauline Sheerin£, Vincent Deehan£, Thomas Bell£, Rosemary McGinley .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube nwrc students boogie beales youtuber takes tour across northern ireland","story":"CAPTION: Youtuber Adam Beales TheNewAdamb pictured with NWRC lecturer Carie Logue Houston, and students Joshua Curran Kelly, Erwin Paul Ytis, Tasha Grant, Warren McCook and Megan Harkin."},{"url":null,"title":"charity show raises 5000 for","story":"The Stand Up To Cancer show at Theatre Hafren in January.\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Charity show raises £, for good causesLlanidloes Dragonettes \" \"   typemchtype\" Charity show raises £, for good causesThe show raised more than pound, for good causes\" \"   typemchtype\" Charity show raises £, for good causesThe show raised more than pound, for good causes\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"hay festival 2019 tickets now","story":"Twenty years of Julia Donaldsonrsquos lsquoThe Gruffalorsquo will be markeltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtd at this yearrsquoltspan classtruncate-full-screengts Hay Festival.

It is vital our leisure services are made welcoming for our entire community.Council chairman Mark Murnin welcomed the move and said he was delighted that families with children with autism could enjoy the same facilities as families in Newry.Committee chairman Cllr Gareth Sharvin said he had raised the matter with the February meeting.The move was also welcomed by Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.The news has been welcomed by Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group which has been working with the council on the proposal.Group chair Aacuteine Sloan welcomed the move, saying ldquoit will now make this first class facility accessible to all.She added: ldquoIt will give local autism families the opportunity to use the pool and feel more relaxed alongside other families that understand the struggles that may arise.

A Rhys OrsquoDonnell box kick was marginally long and carried back with interest before quick hands from Crosbie put his winger in for a superb try.The conversion left the game in the balance at -.The home side continued to dominate possession and territory and a Reaney penalty following a great breakdown turnover from skipper Aaron Cairns gave them a little breathing space.Old Belvedere, despite showing admirable invention, were guilty on occasion of overplaying and a series of errors meant they were pinned back in their own half.The bonus point score went to Cronin who drove over the line when Adair was held up just short and with  minutes to go Hinch looked certain of victory at -.A superb defensive effort then kept their Dublin opponents at bay in relative comfort until the th minute when the pressure eventually led to an overlap to leave the away side in with a chance of a draw as the game reached its final moments.However, in their desperation to run the ball out of defence and keep the game alive, Old Belvedere conceded a penalty which Reaney knocked over to clinch the win.That should have been the end of proceedings, but a penalty from a scrum led to another Belvo charge and they were awarded another penalty which Crosbie slotted with the last kick of the game to take two points back to Dublin.Ballynahinch continue their winning run and stand level with Old Wesley at the top of the table with two games to go.Ballynahinch Old Belvedere AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Best friends laid to rest after accident  ","story":"BEST friends Shane McAnallen and Martin Patterson were buried side by side on Saturday.The two men in their twenties died together in a car crash on the Carlingford to Omeath Road in the early hours of Monday, March .It is believed they died at the scene and that no other vehicle was involved.Mr McAnallen was from the Castlewellan area and Mr Patterson was from Bryansford.Their tragic deaths, and that of missing Newcastle woman Ruth Maguire who also died in Carlingford over the St Patrickrsquos holiday weekend, left the community numb with grief.A community candlelight vigil was held in Carlingford on Sunday night which was attended by representatives from the deceasedrsquos families and rescue and emergency services.All three were connected to Bryansford GAC mdash the young men were former under-age players while mother of three Ms Maguire was the clubrsquos under-age coach.Mr Patterson also played for a time with Ballynahinch RFC U-s.He and Ms Maguire were also connected to St Maryrsquos Primary School in Newcastle.Ms Maguirersquos children attend the school and she was active in the St Maryrsquos Parent Support Group while Mr Patterson was a fondly remembered past pupil of the school.Ms Maguire was also known through her work as a casual leisure attendant at Newcastle Centre and also as a nursing assistant at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry.The  year-old had been reported missing from a group of friends on a hen night while there were out socialising in Carlingford on Saturday.An extensive land and sea search was carried out on Sunday.On Monday, her body was recovered from the lough around the same time as the deaths of the young men became public.Mr McAnallen and Mr Patterson, also known as Marty Patt to friends, were laid to rest in separate ceremonies with many local people attending both services.A funeral for Mr McAnallen was held in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan early on Saturday morning.

local councils are being encouraged to provide financial support for the Air Ambulance Northern Ireland.The appeal has been issued by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who last month secured across-the-board political support from his Newry, Mourne and Down Council colleagues to provide funding to the service which plays a critical role across the district.It has been revealed that between August  and November last year, the air ambulance responded to  incidents across the council area.ldquoThe air ambulance is vital for people across the district, given its rural nature and attractions like the Mournes and Strangford Lough, Cllr Walke rsaid.The Rowallane politician recently visited the air ambulancersquos base outside Lisburn where he was joined by two of his party colleagues from Mid Ulster and Derry and Strabane Councils, both of which have agreed to provide financial support for the lesaving service.With three local authorities already on board, Cllr Walker hopes that the remaining eight Northern Ireland councils will provide financial support.He said while Stormont funds the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment, it should be picking up the remainder of the servicersquos running costs.He confirmed that Strangford MP Jim Shannon plans to raise this issue with Department of Health Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly.ldquoDown District is already a main user of the air ambulance service which has already helped save a number of lives, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoThe service relies heavily upon donations to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs and while this is welcome, I believe local councils and indeed the Department of Health needs to do more.Cllr Walker says while the air ambulance relies heavily upon public support, it also needs a sustainable funding stream to ensure it can continue to save lives and hopes this will be provided by the Department of Health.ldquoThe service is a key component of the emergency services and should not have to rely on charitable donations, he continued.ldquoGiven the costs to keep the service in the air, I believe all of the Provincersquos  councils, supported by the government department, have a role to play.Cllr Walker, who was recently made aware of the excellent work of the air ambulance when the crew responded to an emergency in Killyleagh when a woman was involved in an accident in Plantation Street, confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos financial contribution to the service will be agreed at a meeting of its efficiencies working group.He added: ldquoThe air ambulance is an excellent service which all of Northern Ireland is fortunate to have and it is important that we continue to support its

the iconic sweeping beam at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse near Killough is seeking a meeting with local politicians.The Lecale Lightkeepers want to meet face-to-face with Newry, Mourne and Down councillors to spell out why the beam must be retained and why the proposed LED replacement suggested by the Dublin-based Commissioner of Irish Lights is totally inadequate and unacceptable.Campaigners have also submitted a Freedom of Information request to the local authority for copies of all correspondence between the councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Department and the Commissionerrsquos office on the lighthouse issue.Last month, the local authority was heavily criticised for excluding the press and public from a meeting mdash billed as a workshop mdash involving councillors and representatives from the Commissionerrsquos office, including its most senior official, Captain Robert McCabe.The council subsequently confirmed the workshop, held at the local authorityrsquos headquarters in Downpatrick, was a ldquopreliminary information session for councillors and that prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for the future of the lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation would take place.The workshop lasted well over one hour but the report from the behind-closed-doors session which has been sent to councillors amounts to a paltry two and a half lines.Signicantly, the paper does not detail the questions put by councillors or, most importantly the response from Commissioner officials, compounding the frustration of those seeking to retain the beam.They are angry that the council report provides no detail whatsoever of what was discussed and simply states the issue of the lighthouse beam will be raised at district electoral forums across the district.Campaigners insist that as the Commissioner of Irish Lights had the opportunity to put its case before councillors, it is only right and proper and in keeping with equality legislation and good old fashioned fairness, that the Lecale Lightkeepers should be afforded the same opportunity.The campaigners have been exchanging correspondence with council officials and described one response confirming the sweeping beam issue will be discussed at ious district electoral forums with a view to having a joint meeting with Captain McCabe, which the public could also attend, as ldquodismissive and derogatory.The Lecale Lightkeepers have also vehemently rejected the councilrsquos view that a joint DEA meeting to put questions directly to representatives of the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be the ldquomost appropriate forum to address the issues they have raised.A spokesperson for the campaign group said councillors were keen to protect the iconic, sweeping beam, describing plans to remove the mercury bearing which rotates the Fresnel lamp due to health concerns as ldquoflimsy and flawed.They have also rejected claims that a new LED light proposed by the Commissioners would be the same, arguing this ldquosimply isnrsquot true.Campaigners say it is their understanding that some councillors are at a complete loss as to why the local authority is denying them a chance to meet all of the councilrsquos  members to state their case.They say Commissioners were in Downpatrick last month because councillors voted unanimously to invite them for a meeting to discuss the controversial plan to replace the sweeping beam with what, in their view, is a much inferior light.ldquoThe irony of what is happening is not lost on us, said the spokesperson for the campaign group.ldquoCouncillors discuss the issue of the sweeping beam and unanimously agree that it should be retained. They propose to meet with the Commissioners which happens but yet when campaigners ask to meet with all the districtrsquos elected representatives at one time, we are denied this opportunity. Why The spokesperson added: ldquoWe hope councillors will demand a detailed account of the recent workshop so the views of the Commissioners can be critically examined and scrutinised by not only campaigners, but elected representatives, to determinethey are accurate.ldquoIf, in our opinion they are not, we should be given an opportunity to refute them in front of councillors who were elected to represent the people of this district and who are accountable to them.ldquoIf changes are made at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse, the historic character of the sweeping beam will be lost forever. We must all stand together and ensure this does not happen. What is being offered by the Commissioner is inferior to what we currently have.A council spokesman said officers from the the Commissioner of Irish Lights will be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums.He explained this is to ensure that information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for St Johnrsquos Lighthouse in the immediate future before any plans are finalised.The spokesman added: ldquoRequests for details of future public consultations on plans for St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse would be best addressed by the Commissioner of Irish Lights..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar food sauce firm in deal with Aldi  ","story":"PREP House Sauces in Crossgar has won its first business with discount retailer Aldi in the Republic of Ireland.Prep House is a family business which has won a string of national awards for its original sauces and dressings.Itrsquos now supplying its pepper sauce to Aldi for its network of  stores across the Republic.Managing director Paul Bell, who took over the management reins of the company in , described the new deal as ldquoa marvellous boost.ldquoThis very important business for us resulted when we swtly followed up a lead from Invest NIrsquos Drew McIvor, he added.ldquoOur approach was well received by the Aldi buyer who was extremely interested and very supportive.

The Down sharp shooters lost their way and tried their luck from distance. The result was aimless, wayward shooting.Louth, who deservedly led - to - at half time, made a decisive burst with eight unanswered points either side of the break.Full forward Sam Mulroy bagged half their tally, all five of his points coming from frees, during that purple patch, with midfielders James Calfand Tommy Durnin also registering.With  minutes to go Louth led - to - and then came the Down revival, led by Darren OrsquoHagan who scored a goal and a point.The goal came after Donal OrsquoHarersquos initial shot was brilliantly kept in by Connaire Harrison. The ball fell to OrsquoHagan, who dummied and then fired his shot into the net.Harrison,who looked impressive,registered a great point and when Paul Devlin and then OrsquoHagan also pointed, the gap was down to a single score.Down, who had mounted a number of successful comebacks during the campaign, looked as though they were going to mount another great escape.But it was not to be.

I am confident that the completed public realm scheme will signicantly enhance the ambitious plans to develop a new retail and commercial centre at this part of Downpatrick.It was confirmed recently that the former police base will not be bulldozed as part of the ambitious multi-million pound plan to regenerate this part of the town.The building mdash which enjoys protected status mdash is to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project which, in addition to new retail and commercial space, could also include an element of housing provision.Council officials insist the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and view preserving the former station as an opportunity and a challenge, insisting it very much remains part of the overall development project and potentially could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.To date, senior retailers including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in opening new premises at the proposed retail complex which will be built on a huge area of land stretching back as as far as St Patrickrsquos Avenue.A council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that while the public realm works were scheduled to complete on March , a utilities company was required to undertake work in Irish Street before the public realm contractor was able to get on site.She added: ldquoDue to unforeseen circumstances experienced by the utilities company on site which required their attention, it resulted in a delay to the completion date of the overall public realm scheme.

He said that in addition to the trauma of suddenly losing a young child, they now faced the added pressure of having to have their child flown to England for post-mortem.Mr McGrath said it was his understanding that the issue impacted on around  families a year, highlighting the importance of doing everything possible for families.ldquoThere are a number of considerations here, suggested Mr McGrath. ldquoWe have to consider the period of time to conclude the post-mortem andthe child to their family for burial.ldquoI am very heartened to hear that the present model involving Liverpool is maintaining the turnaround times. What is also of the utmost importance is supporting the childrsquos family and I am glad to hear that there are bereavement support teams here for families.Mr McGrath added: ldquoThis is not going to be an easy process, however what is absolutely vital is that we get the right long term solution and my colleagues and I will be pressing the government department for that.ldquoCllr Trainor and I met departmental officials to ascertain how we can progress matters for the peace of mind of families here.Explaining the background to sending babies to Liverpool for post-mortem, Cllr Trainor said the paediatric pathologist who was involved in carrying out these procedures in Belfast moved from his current post and there was no one available to fill the position.ldquoFrom our meeting, it is apparent that there is a shortage here of paediatric pathologists and this is why the link with Liverpool has been implemented as a short term solution, he said.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoThe Department of Health is also looking at the possibility of an all island approach. However, such a process would take some time to develop as we look at the possibility of a standardised level of care between north and south.Local health campaigners are also seeking a meeting with senior health chiefs to discuss the issue of child post-mortems being held in Liverpool.The Down Community Health Committee believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.At one of its recent meetings, Mrs Anne Trainor, suggested that the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.She described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

In  the organisation became Reconciliation, Education and Community Training .Over the last  years under her guidancethe organisation has developed and changed from a single identity group to cross community. With the aim of supporting the community and developing programmes to meet their needs it has a core ethos of accepting and respecting people regardless of their background. REACT’s journey through the last  years is a true reflection of the peace process at a community level and Marions dedication to the promotion of good relations.Never afraid to take risks she has worked with others from erse backgrounds in the community to address some of the most contentious issues faced by those who work in the field of community relations.She believes that only through dialogue can dferences be resolved — something which she has demonstrated time and again through her work with loyalist bands.“There are hundredsof parades which pass off peacefully and only a very few which don’t,” she said. “Planning and talking and taking a rational approach have worked for all the areas through the band forums.”Charmain Jones has worked as a Community Relations Officer with Rural CommunityNetworkin Cookstown for over eight years. Charmain currently works with a number of dferent communities on both a single identity and cross community basis.Charmain’s journey in community development and community relations has spanned  years. She first started working for local grass roots organisations both in Portadown and Armagh and now has a regional remit based in RCN offices in Cookstown. Charmain has worked tirelessly to address issues facing iniduals, communities and wider society and is fully committed and passionate in relation to her work. Five years ago Charmain organised a shared history event that became a turning point for her in supporting local communities to truly explore their shared history and heritage. This medium really worked for participants who reported that the approach helped them understand common values. Putting shared history and heritage in the spotlight contributed to and reinforced a sense of belonging.SDLP election posters vandalised Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Since then Charmain has been engaged in numerous shared history courses, workshops and school programmes across rural NI. This work has been recognised by CRC and the Heritage Lottery Fundas a model of good practice. The approach needs almost constant innovation to create new programmes and share ideas with communities that are resistant to change and engage them in good relations projects.It’s no surprise that Marion and Charmain have and continue to collaborate on many projects and are respected and admired by participants and funders alike.Marion Jamison said: “I’m honoured to receive this award from the Community Relations Council. It is so important that community leaders work in the nooks and crannies of local communities to help people who are dealing with so many dficult issues. “Focussing our workon the grass roots level has meant that we have also been able to contribute ideas and approaches that are now being used outside the local communities that we live and work in. “I am proud that the work that I have been able to do with Charmain and others has made and will continue to make a positive impact across Northern Ireland.”Charmain Jones said: “Much thanks goes to my family, friends and colleagues who support me in the work that I am doing. The work that community relations practitioners do is challenging and time intensive. It requires a constant level of innovation and creativity to engage people at the local level. “Helping local people and testing out local approaches is vital to delivering good models of community relations practice. “It’s a real honour to receive this award with my friend and colleague Marion Jamison. We have worked hard together to overcome many challenges in the delivery of good relations work and I look forward to the exciting work we will continue to deliver into the future.”try catch  TrendingPrayers for local family of Greenvale victim \"Concern for missing N.I. girl - P.S.N.I. issue emergency appealCookstown tragedy funerals: The funeral of -year-old Lauren Bullock has taken place at St Patrickrsquos Church in Donaghmore, Co.

It is hugely important as the main transport gateway, with rail, coach and bus connections to all parts of Northern Ireland and beyond\". “It will provide over  direct jobs during construction as well as additional longer term investment and job opportunities,\" he said. “As a catalyst for the regeneration of the local area, the plans will play a key role in positioning Belfast as a modern, confident and progressive city supporting the City Councils Belfast Agenda. “We have seen strong passenger growth in recent years with a record  million passenger journeys last year, the highest in  years.  This modern, innovative Transport Hub will allow us to build on this success, to meet growing customer demand, increase transport connectivity and enhance the customer experience as even more people choose to use public transport. “There is widespread support across the local community, businesses, city stakeholders and political parties, and we are delighted that this project has been given the green light. “We look forward to getting this ‘transport led regeneration’ project underway, in order to meet the future needs of commuters, visitors and residents in Northern Ireland.  We will continue to work with all our stakeholders as the development progresses.\" It is estimated the project could support up to  jobs during construction.

Work is expected to start in autumn, with the plant up-and-running by  Ciaran Devine, director of Belfast Power Limited said the green light comes at a “critical time for Northern Ireland’s electricity industry, and the power station will play a central role in ensuring we have enough electricity to meet demand over the coming years. “The project also represents a signicant sht towards low-carbon electricity generation in Northern Ireland. Using state-of-the-art Siemens technology, it will be the most efficient of its kind anywhere in the UK and Ireland. “This is good news as we continue the journey towards decarbonisation and will ensure competitive costs, which will benefit consumers. “At a time of considerable uncertainty, we’re proud to be bringing this level of investment to Belfast, which will result in the creation of over  full-time jobs when construction begins and over  full-time roles when the plant is operational. “DfI has been thoroughly professional in its approach to the application since it was submitted in April .

Which makes it even more impressive that, in that time, he’s also managed to start and scale up one of the great business success stories in Northern Ireland, David Meade Events. Known for his skills as a mentalist and speaker, David also runs the company which delivers cutting-edge corporate events, learning and development workshops, and offers keynote speaking services. It has achieved double figure growth every year since its establishment in  working not only in UK and Irish markets, but also internationally. Asked how he had ersied into events and keynote speaking from being an on-stage mentalist, David says: “I’ve actually been delivering events and keynote speeches very successfully in the UK and Ireland for a number of years, but I suppose most people know me for my tours and the more corporate side of my business was lesser known. “I moved into this space roughly seven years ago because I love inspiring and motivating people and it was a natural move to work with companies who want to inspire their teams to be innovative and the best they can be.” David believes there are even more opportunities outside our region and this year the company is investing over £, to take advantage of them. This includes investing in new video learning services, enabling people to access David’s bespoke training services remotely, from wherever they are in the world. “Over the last number of years, the company has grown at a phenomenal rate and this latest investment was a no-brainer because we simply had to respond to that growth.” David says: “We are still based in Northern Ireland, but there is a huge untapped market that we want to explore further. The world is getting smaller because of technology and we want to meet the challenge and work with people all across the globe. So far in  we have contracts in  countries, including Dubai, Singapore and Switzerland and many more are in the pipeline.” David’s list of international clients reads like a who’s who of the biggest and most impressive organisations in the world including Apple, Hard, Mercedes Benz, Adobe, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, British Airways and Canon. David attributes his company’s success and ability to attract such high-level clients to its ability to adapt and innovate in response to the market. “If the uncertainty of today’s marketplace teaches us anything, it’s that you must evolve and that’s what we’re doing – keeping up with the ever-changing market and meeting the ever-increasing demands, both in Northern Ireland and across the globe.” One of the company’s most exciting innovations has been the development of a bespoke in-house video production studio. This has greatly enhanced its capacity to produce media projects for its clients. Allowing clients to access the bespoke training remotely means the firm can compete all over the globe. This view of the company, as competing on an international stage, is a vital part of David’s approach to business and informs the business decisions he makes, including this recent quarter of a million-pound investment. He explains “The investment in our video learning service means we can deliver training to clients in any corner of the world, at any time. Thinking of ourselves as part of a global economy, rather than just the Northern Ireland economy has been key to shting the company up a gear.” He has grown to a team of  and this year the company is expected to achieve a turnover of £m, an impressive milestone for any company but something David considers not a destination or even a point to slow down, but simply a  to push on to bigger and better things. “As the company continues to thrive and grow every year, I find myself looking at new and innovative ways to keep up with demand. Hitting that £m milestone will be energising and whilst I’m proud of the work my team have done here, I’m already thinking ‘OK, what’s next ’ With this investment, our ability to evolve and the international demand for the services we provide, there’s so much more we can do.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn1.jpg","title":"high street in need of leadership to ensure its future","story":"Posted on Monday  March  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland retailers are increasingly frustrated that a lack of government means key areas of reform aren’t being looked at. John Mulgrew speaks to retail experts about the challenges of the high street If there’s one thing Northern Ireland is good at, it’s kicking the can down the road. Again. And while the ongoing political flux at home is being trumped by Brexit, crucial areas of business reform, especially in regards to the ever-evolving retail landscape, aren’t being addressed.And even since the fundamental review and reform of the business rates system was last discussed On the Hill, Northern Ireland and the wider retail landscape has changed further still – with national retailers going to the wall, or narrowly avoiding going bust.“In  our retail sector is in for its fastest ever period of change and reinvention,” Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI says. “This is equally the case for our high streets and town centres.“This change will not all be good, as we will see some more signicant large retail casualties in . However, we will also see the creation of more confident and dynamic independent retailers, who will be at the forefront of a new retail sector, leading toward st century town high streets.”As for the big names facing tough times, HMV called in the administrators once again, while House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley – a recent fresh lease with the owners of Belfast’s Victoria Square shopping centre securing the only Northern Ireland outlet’s future for the foreseeable future.“It is nothing less than disgraceful that we start a second New Year with no Government in place in Northern Ireland, with not even a date set for all-party talks,” Glyn says.“This is hugely disruptive for the economy and Northern Ireland is in danger of becoming an international laughing stock.“With much-needed decisions not being made on reform of business rates, infrastructure investment, addressing an ever-growing skills gap and modernisation of our town centres, Northern Ireland is not just lagging behind the rest of the UK and Ireland, it is in real danger of being left behind internationally.”Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says there needs to be a fundamental review of the business rates system.“Retail is % of the economy but pays almost a quarter of rates – that is not tenable,” he says. “The structural change in retail is not reflected in the business rates system and we need to widen the tax base.“Stormont being down is a problem, as it affects decisions on business rates and apprenticeship levy, plus the changing face of retail, and a lack of legislation to protect shop workers from abuse and violence.”Meanwhile, Northern Ireland’s councils are raising business rates, from the smallest rise in Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, at .%, to the inflation-busting hike of .% from Derry  Strabane District Council. “There is the very real possibility that they will only find out what the regional rate — and their total rates liability — will be the week before those business rates bills hit their doormats,” Aodhan says.Hospitality Ulster’s Colin Neill says the lack of a Government in Northern Ireland is costing the sector millions and damaging the potential for future growth — sighting the lack of progress to modernise liquor licensing as one of its major contributors to the losses.A Liquor Licensing Bill was one of the few pieces of legislation the Assembly had introduced at that time, but the collapse of Stormont killed the Bill, which set out to address the laws.Overall figures point to a mixed bag for the high streets in general. For example Northern Ireland shops in January defied a UK trend slump to rise by almost %, but shop vacancy rates have crept up to %. gtBelfast itself is still recovering from its high street disaster, following the firm at Primark’s Bank Buildings. That led to a city centre drop in footfall of more than a third, while businesses in and around the cordon felt a more considerable drop.“Consumer behaviour is rapidly changing, and people want something dferent from their high streets and I believe that smaller, more agile and tech-savvy retailers who can adapt to this tidal wave of change, will be the ones who will not just survive, but thrive,” Glyn Roberts says.“Government also needs to reboot its policy agenda for the retail sector and for our town centres to meet the challenges ahead.“While devolution remains in limbo, our eleven councils have been doing their level best to fill the gap and provide leadership, despite not having the full ranges of powers to make the real economic changes within their communities.“Retail NI is an organisation working across all  councils, contributing to each of their consultations on local development plans and assisting our members with planning and town centre regeneration.“Local government elections take place in May and Retail NI has already hit the ground running with the publication of our detailed report, ‘Regeneration NI’, which sets out a comprehensive plan to create st century town and city centres. “The regeneration of our town and city centres needs to be the top priority of our local councils and we will be engaging with them and the political parties ahead of the elections.“The Belfast Region and Derry city deals offer huge opportunities for economic, social and infrastructural regeneration for our two main cities and many of our local towns. It is hoped the Belfast Region City Deal will create up to , new and better jobs, alongside delivering a -year programme of inclusive economic growth – including an increase of £m Gross Value Added .”“ will truly be the year of retail reinvention that will see Northern Ireland’s largest sector of industry, perhaps being slightly smaller but more agile, nevertheless a sector, which is vital to the future of our local economy’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"stormont departments compiling emergency no deal brexit contingency list","story":"Posted on Wednesday  March  by John Mulgrew Stormont departments are building a key list of emergency contacts across business and the wider sectors amid contingency planning for a ‘no deal’ Brexit, Ulster Business can reveal.

An email seen by Ulster Business, sent by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , says in the event of a ‘no deal’ scenario “time will be of the essence and identying the correct people to help solve any problems or issues in a very short space of time will be critical”.

It’s understood Bullhouse Brewing Company, currently based in Newtownards, wants to turn a former menswear store on the Newtowards Road into its new brewhouse. The planning application has been made by Landmark East – a company owned by the East Belfast Partnership. It’s been submitted to Belfast City Council for a change of use from retail, to a micro-brewery. Plans show the building, which is around , sq ft, would include a brewing area, storage and a ‘gallery display’ section towards the front of the building. It’s understood the expansion of Bullhouse would see the east Belfast site becoming its new home. The application includes a change of use from “retail unitto micro-brewerywith gallery display space and provision of new external doors, roller shutter in yard wall and forming ramp in yard”. The building at - Newtownards Road had been placed on the market by property firm OKT. It sits close to a range of shopping areas, including Connswater Shopping Centre and Retail Park, whose occupants include Argos, BM Bargains, Lidl and McDonald’s. Bullhouse Brewing began when owner William Mayne got into beer during a trip to the US in . Following that, he began home-brewing, before setting up Bullhouse in . It produces a range of beers, including a core range of a pale ale and IPA, but has also produced brews such as an imperial milk stout, and a double IPA, called Big Axe. It began in a former bull pen on a family farm near Newtownards, and in September , Mr Mayne gave up his day job to concentrate on the brewery full–time, celebrating the occasion by brewing a pale ale called P. The move to east Belfast would expand the area’s craft beer credentials. Not far from the proposed Bullhouse site is Boundary Brewing, located at Portview Trade Centre. The co-operative brewery, founded by Belfast man Matthew Dick, sells a core range of beers, and a wide-range one of one offs, such as barrel-aged stouts, sour beers and double IPAs, and also hosts a regular taproom at the brewery. Mr Dick sets the brewery up after raising more than a £, in just a few days through crowd-funding.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
