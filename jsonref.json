A study carried out by Essity in the past year found that incontinence was seen as even more difficult to discuss than depression. Many doctors speak of male patients using their wives’ sanitary pads so they don’t end up with a soggy pair of boxers, or staying indoors due to “bladder leash” – the fear of not being able to locate a loo when leaving the house. When is male incontinence most likely to strike?There are different types of incontinence, with men most likely to experience “urge incontinence”. If you’ve ever felt a strong, unexplained impulse to pee, but find you’ve only got a few seconds to sprint to the bathroom, it’s probably urge incontinence. That’s why some men suffer “latchkey incontinence”, the sensation that the floodgates are about to open the moment you twist the key in your front door. Our internal plumbing is usually to blame for leakage, particularly overactive detrusor muscles. When these muscles contract too often (perhaps because you’ve had too much alcohol, too few fluids or even because you’re constipated), it can result in an uncontrollable urge to urinate at unforeseen moments, such as when you hear running water. Other factors that may make it harder to avoid dampness down under include being overweight or having had surgery for prostate cancer, which can result in weakened muscles. Men are also likely to experience post-micturition dribble, which causes a map-like stain to form on underpants after urinating. It’s often down to weakened pelvic floor muscles. What other types of incontinence are there?Men can also experience stress incontinence. That’s not “stress” as in feeling overwhelmed by a bulging inbox, but “stress” as in pressure. It happens when the bladder is put under sudden strain, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting weights in the gym, all of which can cause urine to leak, possibly because the pelvic floor muscles are weak. Incontinence can also be caused by overflow incontinence (also known as chronic urinary retention). This is when the bladder doesn’t entirely empty, resulting in a man passing small trickles of urine regularly, along with a feeling that the bladder is constantly full. How can I manage my incontinence so I can lead a normal life again?For starters, go and get a checkup with your GP to help you find out the cause. A trip to your GP may result in you being prescribed a course of antibiotics, or given advice on how lifestyle choices (see below) could alleviate symptoms. Until that’s addressed, and any changes kick in, many men have found the easiest way to manage their urine leakage is by using incontinence products, which allow them to enjoy the social activities they did before. Unsure where to start? Try TENA’s free Keep Control sample pack, which arrives discreetly packaged and allows you to road-test the incontinence tech that works best for you. This could be absorbent protective pads or underpants that look just like normal boxer shorts but keep nether regions dry. What else can I do to prevent bladder attacks?Not gulping down endless cups of tea and coffee during your working day can help, as caffeine is a diuretic that can increase the amount of urine you make. That said, it’s important to drink enough fluids so try to sip plenty of water throughout the day. Eating a healthy diet and keeping to a good weight is also beneficial, as being overweight puts pressure on the bladder. And don’t forget the pelvic floor, the muscles that hold the bladder and rectum in place. Men have less active pelvic floors than women so any exercises that strengthen them, such as pilates, are great.

The country has now registered 462,791 total coronavirus deaths and 16,545,554 total confirmed cases.President Nicolas Maduro’s government has said for months that it has been unable to pay for vaccines due to US sanctions however, last month, it announced it had now come up with the funds to enter the COVAX scheme. The event, called Let’s Tackle Covid, aimed to increase the number of vaccinations as cases of the variant discovered in India surge in Hounslow, west London. The task force added that there will now be three flights a week from Moscow to London. The country has also decided to resume a limited number of regular flights to other countries, including Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Lebanon.Data has shown the coronavirus variant first detected in India, known as B.1.617.2, is continuing to spread across England and is thought to be driving a rise in cases. It is believed to be both more transmissible than the variant first detected in Kent, which previously dominated, and somewhat more resistant to Covid vaccines, particularly after one dose. The situation has led some scientists to warn the country is in the early stages of a third wave of coronavirus which, despite the vaccination programme, modelling suggests could lead to a rise in hospitalisations and deaths, and that full easing of restrictions in England in three weeks’ time should be reconsidered. The British Medical Association called on the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to honour his pledge to lift measures based on “data, not dates” and said the government should hold off giving the green light to progressing to stage four of the roadmap “until the latest data can be scientifically considered”. “We are at a pivotal moment,” said the BMA council chair, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, who warned a “premature” ending of all legal restrictions may result in a surge of infections that “would undermine our health service” and undo all the progress made suppressing Covid-19. “We cannot afford to repeat past mistakes,” he said. More of the report here: Currently, 25.4 million people have received the first shot of a vaccine, representing about 38 per cent of the population and nearly one in two adults. Peru’s prime minister Violeta Bermudez said in a press conference announcing the result of the review, “We think it is our duty to make public this updated information.”  Peru’s new total is in line with so-called excess death figures, which researchers have used to measure possible undercounting in other countries.  Excess deaths measure the total number of fatalities and compare it with the same period pre-pandemic.  But Peru has been one of the most affected coronavirus countries in Latin America, which has overcrowded hospitals and exceeded the availability of oxygen tanks. Reuter’s reports that the four coronavirus variants considered of concern and known generally by the public as the UK, South Africa, Brazil and India variants have now been given the letters Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta according to the order of their detection. Any new variants will follow the pattern and continue down the Alphabet.  The choice of the use of the Greek Alphabet came after months of deliberations with other possibilities such as Greek Gods considered by experts, according to bacteriologist Mark Pallen who was involved in the talks. Explaining the decision, the WHO said, “While they have their advantages, these scientific names can be difficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting.” “No country should be stigmatized for detecting and reporting variants,” said WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove. Historically, viruses have frequently been associated with the locations they were thought to have developed, such as Ebola, named after the eponymous Congolese river. However, this can be damaging for the places and are often inaccurate, as is the case with the ‘Spanish flu’ of 1918, whose origins are unknown. The decision will mean that the oldest international tournament in the world will go ahead as planned on 13 June, with the final scheduled on 10 July.  President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the lighter measures, in response to falling cases, would go into effect on Tuesday, and under the new rules, nationwide daily curfews are delayed by an hour to 10pm, Reuters reports.On Monday, France recorded 1,211 new coronavirus cases, down from 2,229 last Monday and the lowest case count since 17 August. The latest figures take the total to over 5.66m. The French health ministry reported 126 new deaths, compared with 62 last Monday and a seven-day moving average of 124. The total death toll now stands at 109,528. They also reported 2,945 people in intensive care units, down by 48 from a day earlier. But on Mondays, the case count usually drops sharply because of weekend reporting lags.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

File Photograph: The Data breached at Independent News \u0026amp Media (INM) in 2014 may have contained a “significant volume” of information obtained by journalists, including data identifying sources, an unpublished report by the State’s privacy watchdog has found.The report by the Data Protection Commission (DPC) found that the information accessed during a “data security incident” in late 2014 may have included “sensitive personal data” and “confidential information including information identifying or provided by confidential journalistic sources, or investigative material not intended for publication”.The watchdog’s report, completed in February but not disclosed publicly until now, said that the “unauthorised or unlawful disclosure” of sensitive information at the centre of the 2014 data breach “could have, or could have had, serious implications for the rights of data subjects”.In February the DPC found that INM – now known as Mediahuis Ireland following a change in ownership in 2019 – breached data privacy law when emails and other records relating to staff, journalists and executives were removed and searched outside the State by IT contractors.No legal basisThe regulator said there was no legal basis for the searching of the data and that security around processing of the information did not comply with data protections.The report – seen by The  – supporting those findings was not published as the DPC said it fell under older legislation that predated its powers to publish.The 2014 breach, which emerged from disclosures by two internal whistleblowers, led to an investigation by the State’s corporate law watchdog, the appointment of two High Court inspectors and a series of court actions by people whose data appears to have been affected. The company’s chairman at the time, Leslie Buckley, who stood down in 2018, claimed that the purpose of the data search was for a cost-cutting exercise within the business. He kept businessman Denis O’Brien, then a shareholder in INM, informed about the search.The cost of the search by contractors – Dublin firms DMZ IT and Specialist Security Services and Wales-based Trusted Data Solutions UK – was borne by one of Mr O’Brien’s companies.The DPC report said personal data at the centre of the 2014 “data security incident” may have contained “a significant volume of information obtained, communicated or created by the INM staff members in the context of journalistic activities carried out on behalf of INM”.‘Particular concern’This was a “matter of particular concern,” the DPC said, given INM’s business as a news publisher and because it acknowledged that the data may have contained emails to, from and about people internally and externally and documents written by staff such as journalists.The regulator disclosed that four mailboxes of people who had worked at INM were restored by the outside contractors during work between late 2014 and early 2015. Only three of the four were people who appeared on a previously disclosed list of 19 iniduals who were targets of data searches. The “INM 19” list included former INM executives, journalists, public relations executives and two lawyers who worked for a tribunal which investigated some of Mr O’Brien’s business affairs.The company told the regulator that it was “not possible” to quantify the number of people affected by the data breach as the company’s servers and related back-up IT tapes in October 2014 – the date of the breach – contained “all employeescontributorsthird-party vendorsservice providers, consultants and others whose namesemail addresses are contained on the server”.INM said that the information could have included “sensitive personal data”. The DPC said that it was a “significant concern” that INM could not provide specific detail on the data affected.The DPC found it “particularly concerning” that INM allowed data processing “in the absence of very substantial guarantees as to the continued security and confidentiality of the data”.‘Loss of control’The fact that at the most fundamental level of data protection compliance INM could not confirm definitively all of the parties who accessed the data – and whether they deleted it – shows “a substantial loss of control by INM over the personal data for which it was the controller”, the regulator said.Deficiencies in organisational measures and internal governance protocols that could allow the processing of large volumes of personal data including confidential journalistic and investigative material, with significant implications if disclosed, were “particularly concerning”, the DPC said. “For a data controller not to know whether it holds sensitive personal data in the first place is indicative of systemic deficiencies in its approach to data protection,” said the commission.The fact that INM could not confirm definitively to the DPC whether the affected data was sensitive personal data “indicates an alarming lack of awareness by INM around its own collection, processing, keeping, use and (likely) disclosure of personal data,” the regulator said.INM, which was taken over by Belgian media group Mediahuis in 2019, said in February that it has already implemented recommendations made by the DPC in its report and would be incorporating more.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"irish overseas travellers face significant extra expense of pcr tests","story":"Paying through the nose? A PCR test for Covid-19. Photograph: Arun SankarAFP via GettyThe cost of private Covid-19 tests at home and abroad is likely to come into sharp focus in the weeks ahead as international borders reopen for leisure travel and people are allowed to go on holidays as long as they meet certain criteria.Under the rules of the digital green certificate, people will be able to move freely across the EU as long as they have been fully vaccinated, can show they have recovered from Covid-19 or can produce a negative Covid-19 test.Under European Commission proposals, an exemption from travel restrictions will also apply to those with a negative PCR test 72 hours before departure or a negative antigen test 48 hours before departure.Countries will be able to choose which conditions it imposes and at present Ireland is favouring negative PCR tests over antigen tests, a decision that could prove costly for consumers.Apart from having recovered from Covid-19 the only option on the table for children and for many young adults will be a negative test, but that will add considerably to the cost of travel. At the very least a person will have to pay about €150 to cover the cost of tests leaving the country and returning home.But the costs at home and abroad vary wildly. Both RocDoc and Randox are carrying out PCR testing at Dublin Airport and other locations, with the former charging €95 and the latter charging €89. Both promise results within 24 hours.Private clinics on the Algarve, meanwhile, are charging €50 for tests while in Spain the price is about €55.In some countries the cost of PCR testing is determined by the Government and can be subsidised or taxes are not charged. In Europe, Riga Airport is the cheapest, with PCR tests costing €35.If the Government adopts the EU proposals and also allows antigen tests, then the prices will fall considerably. An antigen test at Dublin Airport is €49, while the cost of such a test in Spain is €25.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"irish third level sector needs significant funding to capitalise on brexit","story":"Third level institutions in Ireland have the potential to attract substantial numbers of additions overseas students post-Brexit but need investment to do so, a Seanad Special Select Committee has been told. File photograph: Dara MacDónaill  The Third level institutions will find it difficult to cater to the demand from Erasmus students who are opting to study in Ireland instead of the UK due to Brexit, the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU has heard.Representatives from various third level bodies said Irish colleges and universities will struggle to capitalise on the increased numbers of EU and non-EU students choosing to come to Ireland in the wake of Brexit, due to years of chronic under-investment.Concerns were also raised that Erasmus exchanges, traineeships and work placements, facilitated between Irish and UK colleges, would be withdrawn after the academic year 202223, when the UK formally leaves the Erasmus programme.Students from the Republic who attend colleges in the North, and vice versa, also need clarity regarding their status as international students, the committee heard.Jim Miley, director general of the Irish Universities Association (IUA), said that a substantial number of students who would previously have chosen the UK for their degree programme or for an Erasmus exchange are now likely to opt for Ireland due to Brexit.“More than 120,000 non-UK EU students studied in the UK annually before Brexit. While these students paid high tuition fees, they had access to government grantloan funding to assist with the costs, paid back on graduation. “Access to this funding is no longer available and students who do not have the ability to cover the higher non-EU tuition fees will seek alternative destinations. “The 2021 application deadline to UCAS showed that the number of EU applicants stood at 26,010, down from 43,030 the previous year, a drop of 40 per cent. Ireland should aim to be the preferred alternative destination for these students.”However, the Irish higher education sector will need serious investment to cater to these students, said Mr Miley. The ratio of staff to students in Ireland’s third level institutions is quite low, and facility upgrades are needed. “Capacity constraints could limit Ireland’s ability to absorb this demand,” he warned.He added that the UK was now specifically marketing itself to non-EU international students, so Ireland may not have much of an advantage as previously thought, as the only English-speaking country in the EU. “Rankings are far more potent factors in attracting international students. The lack of adequate investment in the university sector over the last decade means that Ireland has lost ground in rankings and is not in a position to compete as effectively in the highly competitive international student market.”With regards to research activities, which mainly concerns Masters students, PhDs and staff, Nora Trench Bowles of the IUA said Ireland’s Government Budget Allocation for Research and Development (GBARD) has been consistently below 1 per cent of total expenditure since 2012, reaching an all-time low of 0.93 per cent in 2018. “This is well below the EU average for GBARD, which is 1.34 per cent of total government expenditure. Ireland’s is almost half that of key competitor countries such as Denmark, ” she said. An additional €350 million per year would be needed to bring Ireland into line with the EU average.She said other issues, such as housing, the cost of childcare, and the lack of work opportunities for researcher’s families were also hindering Ireland’s research potential.The sector’s ability to purchase lab supplies and building materials is also being affected by Brexit, with Mr Miley warning that building costs of current projects are already costing more than planned.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Up to €3.5 billion in additional spending on Covid supports and economic stimulus will be announced by the Government on Tuesday as it seeks to jumpstart a post-pandemic economic recovery.But the income and business support schemes that have sustained hundreds of thousands of workers and small businesses since early last year are to be gradually wound down, a move which will see payments cut in the months ahead.The size of the package to be announced on Tuesday will put it on a par with a conventional budget day of recent years, which saw spending and tax giveaways of comparable size. But Tuesday’s announcements are intended to mark the beginning of the process which will see the Government wean itself off the massive borrowing of the pandemic period and transition towards more sustainable public finances.The spending round announced on Tuesday will include almost €1 billion from the EU’s recovery fund, and there will be close attention paid to any policy commitments the Government gave in return for the money.Climate action and educationtraining are expected to be the big winners in Tuesday’s funding pledges, with the majority of the EU recovery money going to those two areas.RetrofittingOver half the €1 billion in EU funds will be devoted to climate action projects, including the first widespread national retrofitting programme. Among the initiatives planned is a new loan guarantee scheme that will provide homeowners with low-interest loans to retrofit their homes.The plan will also include provisions for a new major public transport project outside Dublin, as well as other environmental and green business projects.The Department of Further and Higher Education is expected to receive €225 million in additional funding for projects, including €40 million for Technological Universities and €70 million for research projects in area of climate action and digital infrastructure. Solas, the State training agency, will see the largest investments, much of it for training schemes related to climate action.Ministers were meeting on Monday night to finalise the details of the plan, but it is understood that the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) could be closed to new entrants as soon as July.The reduction in rates is expected to begin at the start of September, and will be staggered across three phases over the following months. Under plans being considered, those on the highest rate, €350 per week, will see their payment cut to €300, while those in receipt of €300 per week will have their payment reduced to €250. The lowest rate, €250 per week, will come into line with the jobseekers’ allowance of €203.Final phaseIn the following phase, the €250 rate will also be brought down to €203, while the €300 rate will fall to €250. In the final phase, all recipients will be put on €203 per week.The Emergency Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) will be extended in unchanged form until the end of September.The commercial rates waiver looks set to be extended through the third quarter, while VAT cuts are likely to remain in place.Sources in Government suggested the final version of the plan could yet be “softened”, with the coalition wary of a political backlash if supports are reduced too quickly. The Government has been at pains to publicly emphasise there will be no “cliff edge”. On Monday, one source noted the additional borrowing required for a more gradual tapering would be small relative to already-committed sums.

He was then arrested by police when he turned up at the meeting spot.In a statement to The , an Essex Police spokesman confirmed Shannon was arrested in October 2017 “on suspicion of sexual grooming”.“On July 3rd, 2018, he was charged with being an adult attempting to meet a boy under 16 years of age, following grooming,” he said. He was also charged with attempting to cause a child to look at an image of sexual activity, the spokesman said.“On August 2nd, 2019, he was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years,” he said. Shannon was also registered as a sex offender, ordered to attend a rehabilitation service, and to pay £500 (€580) costs.One source with knowledge of the case said the messages between Shannon and the account occurred over an hour-and-a-half period on a single day.Shannon had lived in Co Wicklow prior to moving to the UK. He had owned a health and safety training company, and was a member of a Freemasons lodge in Wicklow.Following news of Shannon’s death in early May, St John Ambulance described him as a “loyal” volunteer, in an email to its membership.John Hughes, the organisation’s commissioner, told members Shannon was a “good friend,” whose death came as a shock.“For me personally, Larry was a good colleague and loyal St John member,” Mr Hughes wrote. “In recent years, we only saw each other occasionally and that tended to be when Larry was in Dublin and dropped into HQ,” he said.‘Regretful email’After details of Shannon’s conviction was put to the organisation, a spokesman said it wished “to apologise to anyone within its membership base or the public, including most particularly victims of abuse, that were offended by the regretful email”.The organisation could not respond to further questions, “as a consequence of the legal proceedings and independent review currently under way”.An investigation by The  last year revealed several men had been sexually abused in the 1990s by a separate senior figure in St John Ambulance.That alleged abuser, a man now in his 80s, was a senior figure in the Old Kilmainham ision. Five men have now come forward disclosing they were allegedly abused by the man.Dr Geoffrey Shannon, a child law expert, has been commissioned to conduct an independent review into how the organisation handled past reports of child abuse.

While saying that large crowds were not helpful, there was not the same pressure to move against such meetings as had been the case with house parties around Christmas.“There is not a big desire to increase policing visibility too much as at least the crowds are outdoors and it is coming to the end of lockdown.“It is mainly repeating the messaging and encouraging people to remain safe,” said the source.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the public needed to continue adhering to public health measures even in the final stages of high-level restrictions.“We are on a pathway out of this pandemic, but this virus has taught us that if we let our guard down then we are set back on our journey to return to a more ‘normal’ life,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"pandemic unemployment payment to be phased out from september","story":"Under plans being considered, those on the highest rate, €350 per week, will be cut to €300.

Photograph: Hector RetamalAFP via Getty ImagesWhen US president Joe Biden last week ordered US intelligence to intensify efforts to determine the origins of Covid-19, he gave fresh life to the theory that the virus may have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Biden said US intelligence had “coalesced around two scenarios” – that the virus had either emerged naturally or was the result of a lab accident.It was the first time that the president had given credence to the possibility that the virus had leaked from a lab – a notion widely slammed as a conspiracy theory when Donald Trump first made the claim.Current and former officials said there were several reasons why the Biden administration was willing to publicly entertain a theory that Democrats had once slammed.A crucial factor was that critics were more open to the lab-leak theory now that Trump, who was viewed as wanting to vilify China to deflect blame for his handling of the pandemic, was out of office.They also said Biden was reacting to what the intelligence had found. He is now under political pressure to find answers.“The Biden administration has now studied the mountain of disturbing evidence that we were confronted with in the last few months of the Trump administration,” said David Asher, who led a state department investigation into the origins of Covid. “It is jaw dropping. And as they have noted, a great deal more needs to be assessed.”Days before Biden was sworn in, the state department issued a fact sheet on the Wuhan institute that said several researchers had fallen ill with Covid-like symptoms before the first publicly known case. It also said the institute had worked secretly with the Chinese military.Critics did not take the claim seriously because of the view that thren secretary of state Mike Pompeo tended to politicise intelligence. People were also focused on the aftermath of the riots on January 6th and Biden’s inauguration.“We assumed the fact sheet wasn’t going to make immediate headlines. We wanted to put the information into the record so that people could reckon with these facts when tensions and fevers had dropped,” said David Feith, a former state department official who was involved in the release.Lab-leak theoryIn March, Asher said publicly that some Wuhan staff were so sick they were hospitalised. That and a recent Wall Street Journal story that three staff were hospitalised, helped focus attention on the lab-leak theory.But one person familiar with the debate said the driving factor was a shift among scientists who had been wary of helping Trump before the election or angering influential scientists who had dismissed the theory. He said this had helped make Democrats more willing to consider the theory.“The most important thing that has happened is that prominent virologists have since spoken out,” he said.In a letter to the Science journal, a group of 18 prominent scientists said both theories were “viable” and should be taken “seriously” until sufficient data were obtained. They said the recent investigation that the World Health Organisation conducted with China had not given balanced consideration to both scenarios.“Even those of us working the issue inside the government were not well aware of how much scientific opinion was on our side because scientists were generally not speaking up, but you have had certain dams break over the past few months,” said Feith, referring to developments including the letter and the WHO investigation.Anthony Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also appeared to change his stance. Last year, he said the science “strongly indicates” the virus emerged naturally, but he recently said he was “not convinced” and backed an investigation.While Biden was just outlining the view of the intelligence community in his highly unusual statement, his willingness to make their tentative conclusions public also shone more attention on the lab-leak theory.Mathew Burrows, a former senior intelligence official, said he could not remember a president making such a statement, saying they have historically not wanted to be viewed as trying to force a conclusion.Political pressureMike Gallagher, a Republican congressman who has introduced a bill to declassify all the intelligence related to the investigation, also said that Biden appeared to be responding to political pressure, particularly after members of his team called on China to allow a transparent investigation – something few experts believe Beijing will allow.“Biden was feeling the pressure,” said Gallagher. “They felt a little bit of blowback ... but it’s a good move.”One person familiar with the situation said the National Intelligence Council, which collates information from the entire intelligence community, produced two reports last year assessing US intelligence on the origins of Covid. The director for national intelligence declined to comment.Those efforts, coupled with a third “scrub” of the intelligence this year, led to Biden saying last week that two of the 18 branches of the intelligence community leaned towards the natural origin scenario, while a third was more inclined towards the lab-leak theory.Biden said the three had only “low or moderate confidence” in their conclusions while the other branches did not have enough evidence. That has sparked concern that 90 days is not sufficient for intelligence officials to reach any solid determination.“The community as a whole is far away from reaching anything that we could call even a halfway firm conclusion,” said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA official. “The fact that many of the agencies involved have not reached a consensus even for a ‘low confidence’ judgment tells you they’re a long way away from anything conclusive.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"who renames covid variants with greek letters to simplify communication","story":"The World Health Organisation revealed the new names on Monday amid criticism that those given by scientists were too complicated. Photograph: iStockCoronavirus variants with clunky, alphanumeric names have now been assigned the letters of the Greek alphabet in a bid to simplify discussion and pronunciation, while avoiding stigma.The World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed the new names on Monday amid criticism that those given by scientists, such as the so-called South African variant which goes by multiple names including B.1.351, 501Y.V2 and 20H501Y.V2, were too complicated.As such, the four coronavirus variants considered of concern by the UN agency and known generally by the public as the UK, South Africa, Brazil and India variants have now been given the letters alpha, beta, gamma, delta according to the order of their detection.Other variants of interest continue down the alphabet.“While they have their advantages, these scientific names can be difficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting,” said the WHO, explaining the decision.The choice of the Greek alphabet came after months of deliberations in which other possibilities such as Greek gods and invented, pseudo-classical names were considered by experts, according to bacteriologist Mark Pallen who was involved in the talks.But many were already brands, companies or alien names.Another idea to refer to variants of concern as VOC1, VOC2, and so on, was scrapped after he pointed out it resembled an English swear word.Historically, viruses have often been associated with the locations from which they are thought to have emerged such as Ebola which is named after the eponymous Congolese river.But this can be damaging for the places and often inaccurate such as with the so-called Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, whose origins are unknown.“No country should be stigmatised for detecting and reporting variants,” said WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove.Before the new WHO scheme, some scientists had adopted their own simplified nomenclature for variants such as a February paper using bird names.

That makes him a very safe and secure choice.”An austere greybeard in a black-turban – a sign of descendancy from the prophet – Mr Raisi is a behind-the-scenes apparatchik who rose quickly through the ranks of the judiciary after the Islamic revolution, along the way developing close ties to the Supreme Leader and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Mr Raisi also married well, to the daughter of the well-connected Friday prayer leader of Mashhad, Ahmad Alamolhoda. His father-in-law is “probably a force pushing this guy forwards,” said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran programme at the Middle East Institute. That facilitated his rise, allowing him to join Iran’s Assembly of Experts in 2006 – a prerequisite for any supreme leader – despite middling theological credentials, Mr Vatanka said.His behind-the-scenes rise took a public turn in 2017 when he ran in elections against President Rouhani, even though every incumbent since 1981 has won re-election. On the campaign trail he has travelled to neglected provinces to hear the grievances of the poor, blaming moderates like President Rouhani for weakness in the face of Western sanctions.  With Ayatollah Khamenei directing major decisions, Iran’s foreign policy would be unlikely to change drastically under a Raisi presidency, experts say, though his suspicion of the West is clear.But sanctions against him could be a sticking point amid ongoing negotiations over Iran and the United States returning to the nuclear deal. In 2019, as part of former president Donald Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against Iran, the US sanctioned Mr Raisi, charging him with administrative oversight of executions of minors, torture, and inhumane punishment. They also cited his involvement in the regime’s brutal crackdown on the Green Movement protests following the 2009 election. Should he win the election, President Joe Biden may lift sanctions on Mr Raisi for pragmatic reasons, said Leigh Hansson, a sanctions expert and partner at Reed Smith law firm. “It’s going to be difficult engaging with someone who is currently under sanctions by the US,” she said. “I think they’re going to have to do something specifically to remove those sanctions on him.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china must open labs proper scrutiny","story":"The Covid blame game is gathering pace.

As he pointed out, hindsight is a wonderful thing and while the shortcomings are now obvious, matters were not as clear in the early stages of a novel virus for which officialdom appears to have been woefully unprepared.Anger is directed at western governments, even by people who oppose the vaccination programme despite the fact it is the only way out of the lockdowns imposed to keep the virus at bay. Yet little of this fury seems to be directed where it should be – at the source of a contagion that has killed three million people around the world.For more than a year it has become the received wisdom that the virus emerged in a Chinese animal market in Wuhan. Anyone who has challenged this version (which the Chinese do not accept in any case) by suggesting it may have come from a research laboratory in the city is denounced as a conspiracy theorist.Now scientists are increasingly of the view that the virus may well have come from the lab, always a plausible explanation but one that was dismissed partly because it was promulgated by Donald Trump. His successor in the White House has now asked US intelligence agencies to investigate further. The World Health Organisation’s inquiry, which rejected the theory that the virus escaped, has been discredited as inadequate.It is reported that British intelligence agencies believe it to be “feasible” that the coronavirus emerged after a laboratory leak. Indeed most people would consider it bizarre that such an eventuality was ever ruled out when knowing where the virus came from is so important. The WHO seems more concerned with not offending China than discovering the truth. Social media platforms like Facebook had gone so far as to ban posts that suggested the virus might be man-made.A new study from UK Professor Angus Dalgleish and Norwegian scientist Dr Birger Sorensen, claims that Chinese scientists had created Covid-19 in a Wuhan lab before reverse-engineering versions of the disease to make it seem like it came from bats. They have concluded that the virus had no credible “natural ancestor” and it was “beyond reasonable doubt” that the disease was produced through “laboratory manipulation”. Not to investigate this properly would be criminally negligent, far more so than anything alleged against Boris Johnson or Matt Hancock.WHO’s director of emergencies, Dr Mike Ryan, was right to say that the politics of this issue should be separated from the science but it is Chinese state paranoia and secrecy that is the problem here. Beijing needs to be convinced that this exercise is not being carried out in order to attack them.When it comes to “lessons learned” the most important one is not whether tests worked properly or PPE was fully available, but why the pandemic happened in the first place. Lacking this knowledge, other forms of planning and preparation will be rendered useless.As David Davis, the former Cabinet Minister, observed at the weekend, the cover-up around the source of the virus is on a par with the Soviet Union’s efforts to pretend the Chernobyl nuclear disaster never happened. In many ways it is worse, since the impact on the world has been greater both in terms of fatalities and economic fallout.The leaders of the world’s foremost democracies will meet next month at the G7 summit in Cornwall. They need to apply the utmost pressure on Beijing to allow a full and open investigation into what happened. China needs to be convinced that this exercise is not being carried out in order to attack them but the regime must open up its labs to proper scrutiny.It is too late now to do anything about it, but it might stop a repeat of this calamity in future.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"electric car drivers 100 better used petrol version","story":"Electric car drivers would save an average of just £100 after three years compared to the petrol version of the same vehicles, research has found.The analysis by Halfords found that, while electric vehicles are on average 47 per cent more expensive to buy than petrol and diesel equivalents, drivers would likely still make a saving after three years because of lower running costs.Electric cars are seen as a major part of the UK’s push to reach net-zero carbon emissions, and the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from 2030.However, critics have warned that the higher cost of electric vehicles could prove prohibitive for many drivers, although the hefty upfront price tags would be expected to come down over time as more second hand models enter the market.Halfords analysed the biggest-selling electric cars which have a petrol or diesel equivalent, assuming an annual mileage of 10,000.Among the biggest savings after three years were £800 for those who bought an electric Mini Cooper Classic and £1,650 for a BMW i3, despite costing nearly £10,000 and £4,000 more upfront than their petrol or diesel counterparts.However, owning an electric Vauxhall Corsa would leave drivers £1,581 worse off after three years than a petrol Corsa, according to the analysis, although this cost would come down with further years of ownership.Andy Turbefield, head of quality at Halfords, said: “Intuitively we know that electric vehicles can be better value than their nearest petrol and diesel equivalents, but we wanted to make it as easy as possible for people to see it for themselves.”He added: “We’re not suggesting that people should buy electric because of the long term savings, but if people are delaying purchase because of the upfront cost, this should give them pause for thought.”Halfords has launched a calculator for those looking to compare the cost of electric vehicle ownership, including data for 102 electric, petrol, diesel and hybrid models.In some cases, electric vehicles were more expensive on a total cost basis, although Halfords said there are “numerous” examples where going electric is more economical.A recent survey by energy regulator Ofgem suggested that more than a third of households are unlikely to buy an electric vehicle in the next five years.Some of the most common reservations included the price of buying a vehicle, the availability of charging points across the country and the range of batteries.Only 13 models of electric vehicle are currently available for less than £30,000, the Public Accounts Committee recently said as it warned that urgent improvements are needed to infrastructure to meet the Government’s 2030 target.Analysis by the Policy Exchange think tank has suggested that chargers need to be rolled out at five times the current rate in order to provide proper coverage by that date.Last week the regulator pledged £300 million to improving the charging infrastructure and providing 3,500 new points.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive 270 charities paying bosses prime minister","story":"More than 270 charities are paying their bosses more than the Prime Minister, with the highest earner on £4.7m a year, an investigation by The  has found.In the most comprehensive analysis ever made public, this newspaper has discovered that between them the organisations employ more than 2,500 staff members on salaries in excess of £100,000 a year.They range from organisations with income of a few hundred thousand pounds a year to huge international groups where the chief executive is managing a budget of more than a billion pounds.Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission, said that organisations need to justify their pay to the public as she is not shy of making further requirements on transparency.Writing in The , she said: All charities should be able to look donors and volunteers in the eye and say how their decisions about pay impacts on the cause they pursue or the people they help.Being a charity is a privilege. And all charities need to know that they ultimately answer to the public – as donors, volunteers, and taxpayers - for that privilege.There have been numerous attempts to force organisations not only to be transparent, but to justify their pay packets to avoid further eroding public trust which has already been rocked by a number of scandals.When it emerged in 2019 that Marie Stopes had paid chief executive Simon Cooke £430,000, including a sizeable bonus which doubled his salary, the Charity Commission offered rare public condemnation and promised to investigate executive pay.But two years later the regulator’s report has been quietly shelved and an investigation by The  has found that Mr Cooke’s bumper pay packet is dwarfed by awards at other organisations. Using data from thousands of registered charities, this newspaper analysed the latest accounts of those paying their highest earner more than Boris Johnson’s salary of £157,372. This puts them in the top one per cent of taxpayers in the country. The rich list includes 35 charities with the highest earner on more than £300,000 a year.The Wellcome Trust had the highest paid employee, with chief investment officer Nick Moakes taking home £4.64million including salary and bonuses last year – a £1.3million rise on the year before.The health research charity, whose director Sir Jeremy Farrar earns £483,788, said that pay is linked to performance and by bringing their investment team in house they have been able to make billions more to fund their work.As part of a wage bill of £105million, the Wellcome Trust paid more than 90 staff over £100,000, with seven employees in the investment team taking home more than £1million. Other charities topping the rich list are less transparent about what they pay and why. The International Institute for Strategic Studies made it into the top six as its biggest earner took home between £600,001 to £610,000 in the year to September 2019, but the relatively small charity refused to confirm whether CEO Dr John Chipman had received the pay packet.This generous remuneration would still not make him the highest paid charity CEO an accolade that instead goes to Steve Gray, who took home around £935,000 for running Nuffield Health in 2019.The Consumer’s Association, the charity behind Which? magazine, has long hit the headlines for paying its previous CEO Peter Vicary-Smith £825,000 in his final year. Despite his successor Anabel Hoult taking a pay cut, she still took home around £395,000 last year from the organisation, which does not receive public funds and has a commercial arm.Household names including Cancer Research, the RNLI, Refuge, Barnardo’s, the NSPCC, Comic Relief and the National Trust are among those that pay top wages.Medical charities, which argue that they need to pay market rates to be at the forefront of research, account for around a fifth of the 278 charities on the rich list.The Thrombosis Research Institute gave a hefty wage to its highest paid staff member of around £415,000 in the year to July 2020, an increase of roughly £50,0000 on the previous year and in the midst of the pandemic. Its income was just £6.9million.Cancer Research, on the other hand, with its income of £656million, paid chief executive Michelle Mitchell £255,600. A similar disparity between the size of the organisation and the levels of pay are seen across the not-for-profit sector.Arts charities, including museums and theatres, also feature heavily on the list. The Royal Opera House came out third from top by paying its music director Sir Antonio Pappano £839,000 in salary, fees for conducting and pension payments, £100,000 more than the previous year. A spokesman said that he had waived his fees and salary this year because of the pandemic, and Alexander Beard, chief executive, had agreed to take a 25 per cent pay cut on his £297,000 salary.The English National Ballet, the South Bank Centre, the National Gallery, the British Museum and the Tate were all among those sending executives home with more than £200,000 in pay and bonuses, annual returns show.The Design Museum, with an income of £13.2million in the year to March 31 2020, gave its highest salary of around £175,000 to one of its former directors at the same time as experiencing a cash crisis because of low visitor numbers. In contrast, the Victoria and Albert Museum – with an income of £117.4million and more than 4 million visitors – paid director Dr Tristram Hunt a salary of around £145,000. However, Dr Hunt’s pay packet was bumped up to around £220,000 when pension contributions and a £20,000 bonus were added.The Design Museum said it has since appointed Tim Marlow as its new director and CEO, who has voluntarily taken a 25 per cent pay cut from April to October and whose salary for the next accounts will fall into the £150,000 to £160,000 pay bracket.Smaller venues also signed off eye-watering wages, with Roger Wright, the director of Britten Pears Arts, which runs two venues on the Suffolk coast, on a higher salary than the boss of the Royal Albert Hall.Similar disparities were seen at Caudwell Children, a charity with an income of £6.4million and just over 200 staff, which gave chief executive Trudi Beswick a £50,000 pay rise to push her salary into the £350,000-360,000 pay range.This is more than double the comparatively modest £143,000 salary of Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children UK, which has an income of more than £300million and more than 6,000 staff and volunteers.One small charity providing sheltered accommodation was found to have paid its boss more than a quarter of its total £659,000 annual income in the year to March 2020.Other bosses earning huge sums include Hartwig Fischer, Director of the British Museum on around £290,000 Richard Parry, the boss of the Canal and River Trust on £216,209 Dr Charmaine Griffiths from the British Heart Foundation on £189,000 NSPCC’s Peter Wanless on £194,000 in salary and pension and Barnardo’s CEO Javed Khan on £183,000.More than 126 of the highest payers took donations directly from members of the public, according to data on the regulator’s website.Senior industry figures said that those not relying on donations still benefited from billions of pounds in tax breaks, funding from the Government and foundations, and the halo effect of charitable status.Charities argue that they need to pay high wages to attract the best talent, but it is notable that some of the UK’s biggest organisations are absent from the rich list. While not on insignificant salaries, the bosses of Oxfam, BBC Children in Need and the Royal British Legion were not paid more than the Prime Minister.Benchmarking against other companies is also cited as a reason for high pay, but many argue that those in the sector should accept a charity discount.Rob Wilson, the former Minister for Civil Society under both David Cameron and Theresa May, said: The benchmark for most of these public sector charities has been for some time what the Prime Minister earns, and really you have got to have a really significant justification for paying your chief executive more than that.He added: The implications of paying the chief executive too much is that it severely erodes public trust in charities as a whole and is very detrimental to the many thousands of small charities who are working hard on behalf of communities day in, day out, up and down the country.My advice to charities and their trustees is to be very, very careful about their chief executive’s salary. Obviously it is important to pay people what they are worth, but you have to be able to justify it to donors and the public.Mr Wilson also warned that charities risked the stink of hypocrisy if they discussed issues such as poverty whilst paying their chief executive hundreds of thousands of pounds.The Charity Commission has admitted it has abandoned publishing its report on pay which was due out last year.Instead of a one off report, it has made information accessible on its website on how many people at various organisations are paid more than £60,000 in salary bands, a spokesman said. It is also launching a project to further improve the public’s ability to hold charities to account, with charities doing more to explain how they are run, and what difference they are making, the spokesman added.Since 2018 the Commission has required all the organisations it regulates to provide it with details of their highest earners, and this data has led to concerns about management. The commission has no power to set executive pay.The National Council for Voluntary Organisations went further after conducting its own investigation in 2014 and recommended that all charities should publish names and job titles of their highest paid staff. But The  has found that only a small number have taken its advice.Sir Martyn Lewis, who led that investigation in his former role as the head of the NCVO, said that he was disappointed as transparency is central to maintaining public trust.The key is explanation, he told The . So that you have a guarantee that it is not a gravy train and you can show that the trustees of the charity have thought long and hard about what pay is needed.A spokesman for the NCVO said that they understand the concern, but added: It is important to remember that only 9 per cent of charities in the UK employ paid staff and most of those pay modest salaries. Fewer than 1 percent of charities employ a member of staff earning £60,000 or more, and around 80 per cent of charities rely on volunteers to deliver their work.They said that pay – which is set by trustees – is a consistent and key priority for our members and the wider sector and getting it right is important to maintain public trust.Acevo, the charity leaders’ body, said that the average salary among not-for-profit CEOs is £56,000. Decisions about executive pay are made by a board of volunteers who take into account all of these factors, and others like the complexity of the organisation and the need to attract a particular skill set, a spokesman said.Supporters views are incredibly important to charities and if they disagree with a decision about pay, I would encourage them to talk directly to the charity about it.All charities contacted said that decisions on pay followed a rigorous process and are set against market rates to ensure that they can find the best staff for the job. Some executives have agreed to take a pay cut as they cope with the fallout from the pandemic.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hms victory figurehead restored former glory mistaken modern","story":"An historic Royal Navy figurehead from Lord Nelson\u0027s famous warship has been painstakingly restored to its former glory after it was sawn into pieces by workers who mistook it for a modern replica.Originally thought to have been destroyed in the mid to late 20th century, the 200-year-old artefact was rediscovered following a year of scientific and historical investigation.In 2019, heritage chiefs from the National Museum of the Royal Navy – which now tends to Victory – launched an investigation into the wrecked figurehead.They discovered the carving had in fact been created to replace the figurehead damaged in 1805.Andrew Baines, the museum\u0027s deputy director, said: When we discovered that it was 206 years old, we were absolutely delighted.Naval archives show the figurehead was commissioned in summer 1815 and constructed on the Isle of Wight at a cost of £65 – roughly £65,000 today.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"naftali bennett tough talking right winger poised oust benjamin","story":"After dominating Israeli politics for more than a decade, it is difficult to imagine anyone other than Benjamin Netanyahu leading the Jewish state. But the elder statesman could soon be ousted by a pugnacious former tech entrepreneur who claims to be even more right-wing than his former mentor.Naftali Bennett, the leader of the right-wing Yamina movement, is poised to unseat Israel’s longest serving prime minister this week and serve as the head of a cross-party “unity” government. There are many parallels between the two figures, who both served as special forces commandos in their youth, speak fluent unaccented English after spells in the United States and adore the free market. They are also strong supporters of expanding settlements in the West Bank and despise the Iranian regime. This has prompted some Israeli commentators to dub Mr Bennett as Mr Netanyahu’s “Mini-Me,” in an unflattering reference to his bald spot. Born to American immigrants in the northern town of Haifa, Mr Bennett made his estimated $9m fortune as a tech entrepreneur before entering politics as an aide to Mr Netanyahu. Their relationship is said to have been a tumultuous one, with 49-year-old Mr Bennett leaving his role in 2008 after a falling out with his erstwhile political hero. Despite this, he named his eldest son Yoni after Mr Netanyahu’s brother, who was killed during an Israeli hostage rescue mission in Uganda in 1979. Mr Bennett entered national politics in 2013, when he took the helm of a pro-settler party and eventually rekindled his relationship with Mr Netanyahu, serving under him with portfolios in defence and education. He is also a former leader of the Yesha Council, a pro-settler lobby group, and draws much of his political support from his calls to annex the entire West Bank, which is claimed by the Palestinians as their own land. Much like Mr Netanyahu, his inflammatory rhetoric against Palestinians has on occasion landed him in hot water. In 2013, he said that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was something to be endured rather than resolved, comparing it to “shrapnel in the rear end.” In the same year, he reportedly said during a debate on whether to release Palestinian prisoners that “If you catch terrorists, you simply have to kill them.” He is said to have added: “I have killed lots of Arabs in my life – and there is no problem with that.” Allies of Mr Bennett say that his business acumen makes him uniquely well placed to steer Israel out of the economic havoc wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, which at one point saw unemployment rise to 20 per cent. But Mr Bennett himself has acknowledged that implementing his more controversial policies, such as annexing swathes of the West Bank, will have to wait. His potential coalition, which has not yet been finalised, will require a delicate balance of support from both the left and the right, as well as the centrist faction Yesh Atid. It may also depend on the external support of Arab members of parliament, which means any policies unfavourable to the Palestinians could fail to pass a vote in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. “Everyone will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams. We will focus on what can be done, instead of arguing over what is impossible,” Mr Bennett said in a speech on Sunday as he outlined his bid to become Israel\u0027s next prime minister. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists urge delay june 21 covid lockdown lifting","story":"Scientists advising the Government have called for a delay to the planned ending of lockdown restrictions on June 21, warning that the UK faces a third Covid wave fuelled by the Indian variant.Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said ministers should consider pushing back their target of scrapping all measures on that date by a few weeks as new data showed the variant spreading across the country.The University of Cambridge academic said there had been an exponential growth in the number of cases, fuelled by the more transmissible strain, and claimed the high vaccination rate was giving the country a false sense of security.Asked whether businesses should prepare for a delay to the unlocking, George Eustice, the Environment Secretary, said the Government can\u0027t rule anything out.I know everyone wants to know what is going to happen, but we can\u0027t actually make that judgment until we see the impact of the easements just made, Mr Eustice told the BBC.Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of industry body UKHospitality, warned that any delay would be devastating for the sector and push businesses closer to the cliff edge of business failure.Virus deaths and cases have risen in the past week. Between May 24 and 30, there were 60 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive Covid test – an increase of 43 per cent compared with the previous seven days.A further 3,383 lab-confirmed cases in the UK were announced on Monday – the sixth day in a row that cases have topped 3,000 – although only one further death was reported.Scientists from Warwick University are working on a new model predicting the impact of the planned June 21 unlocking on Indian variant case rates. The preliminary paper will be presented to the Sage committee this week, a source said. Ministers have said a final decision will not be announced until June 14.Prof Gupta told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: It will probably take longer than earlier waves to emerge because of the fact that we do have quite high levels of vaccination in the population, so there may be a false sense of security for some time, and that\u0027s our concern.If you look at the costs and benefits of getting it wrong, I think it is heavily in favour of delay.Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, who sits on the Government\u0027s Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), told Sky News: We\u0027re on a knife edge. We could go either way with this new variant. On Sunday, Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, set a new target of offering a second jab to all over-50s before June 21. It came after a Public Health England study suggested both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines were only 33 per cent effective against the Indian variant after a single dose.My view is that it is quite possible that the Government could move to full reopening, but it does really depend on quite a few things, he said.One of the most important things for me would be whether we are seeing cases of vaccine failure with the Indian variant, because that would mean that the vaccine programme we are rolling out is less effective than we think it is. But at the moment we think it is very effective.Prof Read also said he did not agree with the suggestion the UK was now in the early stages of a third wave, arguing there was not a universal expansion of cases.He added: Although we\u0027re seeing rises, we\u0027re not quite at that stage where you would call it a third wave.In the two weeks to May 22, the variant was detected for the first time in areas including Cornwall, Gateshead and West Berkshire, although numbers remain low. In parts of the Midlands, London and the East, the data showed it becoming more widespread. More than 94 per cent of samples analysed from Croydon tested positive in the two weeks before May 22, up from 84.4 per cent in the two weeks before.However, a senior doctor in Bolton, one of the first hotspots of the Indian variant, said the rise in Covid cases in the area was slowing down. The seven-day rate in the Lancashire town currently stands at 386.7 cases per 100,000 – down from 452.8 on May 21 – suggesting the recent surge may have peaked.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thomas becketts fans right not settle arms length experience","story":"Somewhere on an old USB stick, there’s a photo of me groping the bronze bosom of Juliet below a balcony in a courtyard in Verona.

Pilgrims to the British Museum have apparently been leaving “kiss-like smudges” on the glass display cases protecting some of the most sacred objects in the Thomas Becket exhibition. Staff have had to Windolene the tops of the cases over a reliquary casket said to hold fragments of Becket’s bones and over an illuminated manuscript of the Gospels that was commissioned by Becket.Picture the crime: the shifty look to left and right, the glance at the gallery guard, the furtive lowering of face mask, the smacker planted flat on the glass. This sort of thing was peculiar before the pandemic, now it has become downright transgressive.What is it about saints and statues, icons and relics? It’s not enough to look, we want to kiss, to hold, to lay foreheads on cool marble.

The crowds admiring the church were told there was a aposlockdownapos and they had to leave immediately, reports claim. They were said to have been given no clue they were being cleared out to make way for the Prime Ministeraposs top secret wedding plot. Mr Johnson, , wed the -year-old mother of his child at the grand London cathedral where baby Wilfred was baptised just last year. The couple managed to keep the plans for their Bank Holiday weekend nuptials so well under wraps - even close aides expressed surprise at the news.Were you there  Email webnews@mirror Shortly after .pm, the cathedral was suddenly cleared of visitors, with staff saying it was going into lockdown, The Sun reported. Half an hour later, a limousine carrying the bride arrived at the piazza outside the main west door of the distinctive striped brick and stone church. Inside, the ceremony was carried out by Father Daniel Humphreys, who had given the couple pre-marriage instructions and baptised their son last year, the newspaper said. While the high profile coupleaposs engagement had been announced publicly, their wedding date during these uncertain times was unknown. In the end the couple opted - like many couples across the UK whose plans have been affected by the pandemic - not to postpone their nuptials in hopes of a bigger wedding party.Instead, they reportedly managed to slip under even their most senior aidesapos radars to pull off the surprise special day - the culmination of a six month cloak and dagger operation, insiders claim.The couple were only allowed to invite  guests to the wedding, in keeping with current coronavirus protocols. Carrie, who is widely reported to be likely to have taken Mr Johnsonaposs surname, was said to have worn a £, gown by Greek-based luxury designer Christos Costarellos. Guests are believed to have been invited at the last minute to the ceremony, and the full list has not been publicly revealed. However the PMaposs father, Stanley, and siblings Rachel, Jo and Leo were confirmed to have been in attendance. The newlyweds later celebrated at a marquee in the garden at Downing Street, reports said. A No spokesman said on Sunday: “The Prime Minister and Ms Symonds were married yesterday afternoon in a small ceremony at Westminster Cathedral. The couple will celebrate their wedding with family and friends next summer.”A Westminster Cathedral spokesperson told the Sunday Times : On Saturday  May, the wedding of Carrie Symonds and Boris Johnson took place in Westminster Cathedral.The bride and groom are both parishioners of the Westminster Cathedral parish and baptised Catholics. All necessary steps were taken, in both church and civil law, and all formalities completed before the wedding.

Boris Johnson’s delay in banning flights from India, where the most worrying Covid iant originated, jet-fuelled its spread. The rise in cases is concerning but is not increasing hospital admissions or deaths.  The NHS reports that “very, very few” patients admitted with the virus are double-jabbed, so the vaccination programme works. With the Government still looking at making NHS and care jobs dependent on vaccination, it should remember that persuasion and education are better than coercion. The truth is that even existing vacancies can’t be filled, never mind creating new ones. Dreaded bliss  Controversy follows Boris Johnson everywhere, even down the aisle to his secret wedding on Saturday. The answer to disgruntled Catholics asking why the twice-orced Prime Minister was allowed to marry for a third time in Westminster Cathedral is that it was his first wedding within the faith. The previous two were not. The more pressing question for most people is whether Johnson paid for his own wedding. If a wealthy friend covered any of the bill, their identity and the amount should be made public, to avoid potential conflicts of interest. That a signicant number of voters even wondered about the cost is a shadow cast by Johnson’s previous unacceptable behaviour. Real values How reassuring that most of us would prefer to be remembered as a good friend rather than for success or wealth. Because relationships matter more than earnings and career... though a well-paying job is more likely to foster happiness than never having two pennies to rub together.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSBoris JohnsonHospitalsMarriagePoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"israels fresh turmoil ultra nationalist","story":"NewsIsraels fresh turmoil as ultra-nationalist moves to oust PM Benjamin NetanyahuUltra-nationalist and former commando Naftali Bennett has announced he will form a coalition with a centrist party - Israel has been in political turmoil after four elections in two years failed to deliver a decisive victorymirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  MAY News in Jerusalem, on March , \" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _ISRAEL-POLITICS-VOTE.jpg\"Israels then Defense Minister Naftali Bennett whisteprs to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu duing a meeting of the Israeli right-wing block, at the Knessetin Jerusalem, on March ,  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

That’s our first test – to seewe can find smart compromises.” Earlier, Mr Bennett, , declared: “Mr Netanyahu is no longer trying to form a right-wing government because he knows full well that there isn’t one. “He is seeking to take the whole national camp, and whole country, with him on his personal last stand.

Boris Johnsonaposs roadmap has so far gone as planned, with the first three stages taking place on the promised dates in March, April and May. But Step  - which will come no earlier than June  - could be derailed by the spread of the new strain in parts of the country, with some experts calling for the final easing of restrictions to be pushed back. The Government insists it is just too early to say, as officials pore over Covid data to seethe battle between the vaccine and the virus is being won. And evenit does go ahead as billed, some social distancing restrictions could still be in place for longer.  The public has learned from bitter experience how quickly things can change, so all eyes will be on the data in the coming weeks. Hereaposs what we know about the plan to lt the last lockdown restrictions - and whether it will go ahead. What rules are due to change on June   Mr Johnson set out a four-step roadmap out of lockdown back in February, with a phasedto normal le. Most restrictions have now lted, such as the ban on foreign holidays and overnight stays, and pubs, restaurants, retail, galleries and and cinemas have been able to reopen. In Step , the Government aimed to remove all legal limits on social contact, which means any number of people can meet up both indoors and outside. This means you can legally have any people as you want over to your house for dinner or for a picnic in the garden. It also means shuttered venues like nightclubs can reopen, as more people are allowed inside together, and crowds couldto big events like festivals and gigs. Pilots have been taking place to test how big events can . Crowds attended the Brit awards earlier this month, while clubbers ed to the dance floor for trial events in Liverpool at the start of May. It will also factor in whether big weddings can take place, as the current rules allow no more than  guests. Separate reviews are also underway into use of vaccine passports for events and whether social distancing measures can be ditched. Some measures such as face coverings could stay in place for longer as reports suggest the Government may prioritise scrapping the aposone-metre plusapos rule to allow businesses to serve more customers.  How will the Government decide whether to unlock on June   Officials are poring over the data to see whether it is safe to ease restrictions further. Under the roadmap, four key tests must be met before the next step can go ahead. They are:That the vaccine deployment programme continues successfully That evidence shows jabs are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated That infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which puts unsustainable pressure on the NHS That the Government’s assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new iants of concernThe final test about new iants is the critical one here - and whether the Government decides the risk from the Indian strain is too great to move forward. The PM is expected to announce his decision on June , to give businesses a week to prepare.  How much of a threat is the Indian iant  The new strain of the virus has been causing alarm because it is thought to be spreading more quickly than previous iants. The PM is waiting for key data on its transmissibility before he makes the final decision about June . The Governmentaposs advisers recently suggested it could be up to % more infectious, but other analyses have offered lower figures. It is now the dominant strain in the UK, taking over from the Kent iant which ripped across the country in the winter. Cases and deaths have risen in the UK over the past week, linked to the new spread of the iant.Between May  and  there were  deaths reported within  days of a positive coronavirus test, an increase of .% compared with the previous seven days. There were a further , lab-confirmed cases on Sunday, with the number of cases between May  and May  - , - .% higher than the previous seven days. But the success of the vaccine rollout means the country is in a much better place to see off the virus - as long as the jabs work against it. A recent study by Public Health England found the Pfizer jab was % effective against the Indian iant after two doses, while AstraZeneca was % effective. However both were only % effective against the Indian iant three weeks after the first dose. More than  million people have been given a first jab and a further . million have had both doses. The Government has accelerated the vaccine rollout to try to get as many people fully jabbed as possible. All over-s are set to have had both doses by that date under a target set out by vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. But many younger people are still waiting to be called up for their first dose - and there are still examples of vaccine hesitancy. What do the experts say about June   A growing number of scientists have been calling for the final stage to be delayed to give more time to see whether hospitalisations from the new iant are going up. Professor Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , said that with the UK in the grip of an early third wave -and urged ministers to push back June  by a few weeks. He said the country was not too far from reaching the sort of levels of vaccination that would help us contain the virus, echoing calls from other experts to wait until more people have had both jabs.  Professor Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said there had been some encouraging data but the impact of the easing of restrictions in May would not be known until around about June  or just before that. NHS Providers boss Chris Hopson said hospitals are busy with the backlog of non-Covid cases - and even a small uptick in cases could have a big impact. He told Times Radio: The concerns are that this is a much more transmissible iant. Weaposve still got lots of people still to vaccinate. And absolutely hospitals are very busy. Weaposre talking to people who are saying aposWeaposve got -% bed occupancy, this is not the kind of bed occupancy we would normally expect at this time of yearapos. What does the Government say  The tone from the Government has become more muted in recent days, despite pressure on Mr Johnson to stick to the June  date. Tory MPs have been pressing the PM to lt restrictions to help struggling businesses and give people back their freedoms. And Mr Johnson will be keen to stick to his promise after so many u-turns and last minute decisions last year. The Prime Minister warned on Thursday that we may need to wait for more information but said I donapost see anything currently in the data to ert from the June  date. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs it was too early to tell whether England can take the final step to freedom.  On Monday, Environment Secretary George Eustice also said we canapost rule anything out when asked about whether the date should be delayed. He told the BBC: Iaposve said all along, as has Matt Hancock and the Prime Minister, we canapost rule anything out because we know this has been a dficult pandemic, a dynamic situation. We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before. It will only be by then that we will see the full impact of the latest easements we made on May , so I know everyone wants to know what is going to happen but we canapost actually make that judgment until we see the impact.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"179 oven 41 year fridge","story":"News£ oven and £ a year fridge-freezer among greenest white goods awarded by Which Which  says many consumers assume eco-friendly appliances would come at a premium cost but it endorses several cheaper white goods for their green credentialsmirrorShareCommentsByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  MAY News£ AEG series condenser dryer\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Which  said more than half of consumers now considered sustainability important when they were buying and using household appliances. It introduced the Eco Buy scheme last year to meet the demand for ­information on energy efficiency and because the dficulty and high cost of getting appliances repaired causes huge amounts of waste. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  The group found many consumers assumed eco-friendly appliances would come at a premium cost.

It costs just £ a year, on average, to run, which is £ cheaper than the most inefficient ovens.Like news to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters The Blomberg double electric oven at £ also earned an Eco Buy label.

Michael Briggs, Head of Sustainability at Which , said: “We know consumers want to reduce their carbon footprint and make more sustainable choices. “That is why we are evolving the way we test products, factoring in how long they last and their energy efficiency, to help consumers reduce their environmental impact and save money. “The Government is set to introduce new regulations this summer that will require manufacturers to make spare parts for some products available. “These rules should be expanded to cover more appliances such as tumble dryers and ensure spare parts are available for the lespan of each product.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEnergy billsSave moneyWashing machinesEco-friendlyWhich "},{"url":null,"title":"baby becomes first uk 18m","story":"NewsBaby becomes first in UK to have £.m per dose NHS drug to save his leArthur Morgan offers hope to hundreds of poorly children in the gight against genetic disease as a £.million-per-dose drug gives the five-month-old tot the chance of lemirrorShareCommentsByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThere is hope now for baby Arthur \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Type  is the most severe form and develops in babies less than six months old. One in every , to , births is affected by SMA. In most cases, a child can only be born with SMAboth parents have a faulty gene that causes the condition. Around one in every  to  people is a carrier of the main faulty gene. Zolgensma replaces theof the missing or non-working SMN gene with a new, working copy of a human SMN gene. It uses harmless, genetically engineered viruses to increase SMN protein levels. Once the virus is introduced, it travels around the body to dferent cells to restore some of the missing SMN protein. As well as the Evelina, which treated Arthur, centres in Manchester, Sheffield and Bristol are also administering Zolgensma treatment.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSHospitalsLe expectancyTherapyBabies"},{"url":null,"title":"beauty salon boss took 55","story":"NewsBeauty salon boss took  per cent of young mums wages before sacking her by textMegan Lloyd, , used to work as a beauty therapist at The Headonist in Sheffield, which is owned by Jordanna Nichols-Turley, and had been working in the job for six monthsmirrorShareCommentsByAlex GroveLucy SkouldingFreelance writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsBeauty salon boss took  per cent of Megan Lloyds wages before sacking her \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

After months of lockdown and with international travel options made dficult by test and quarantine requirements, the Great British seaside has proved a hugely popular draw today. Photographs from beaches across the UK show sun starved people revelling in the sea and sand. One council, Thanet in Kent, has warned people to turn back at Broadstairs, Margate and Ramsgate,beaches are too crowded, reminding people weaposre not back to normal just yet. The rush to get the beach has been so intense that some cars have been turned away while trying to park up. Next to the shadow of Brighton Pier hundreds of groups of people - all appropriately distanced from one another - could be seen relaxing in the balmy weather.In Bournemouth one man whizzed along a zipline above the sea to get a view of the famous beach, which attracts thousands of people when the sun is shining. Camber Sands in Sussex was typically heaving, providing a predictable logistical problem for those wanting to park up near to the miles long sandy beach front. And Lyme Regis in Dorset was a riot of colourful parasols and windbreakers as far as the eye could see.  It seems that everybody got the memo that this Bank Holiday Monday was going to be one to remember weather-wise. The Met Officeaposs forecast shows bright, uninterrupted sunshine throughout the UK for almost the whole day. Only parts of the west coast of the Isles will get some cloud later in what is due to be an absolute scorcher. The best of the weather is to be had in the South East, where the mercury is forecast to rise as high as C come this afternoon. If it reaches its predicted potential then today will officially be crowned aposs hottest so far, beating March aposs .C recorded in Kew Gardens. Elsewhere in the country the temperature will likely peak at a still very reasonable C. The scorching weather has ensured even those without ready beach access are finding ways to cool off in the water.In London paddler boards could be seen leisurely wending their way down the cityaposs canals, while boys stood in the waterfall like stream of Warleigh Weir in Somerset.There are reports of cars being turned away from Formby Beach in Merseyside as thousands flock to enjoy the sun. If you are thinking of heading to the coast today please consider re-routing or delaying your journey to avoid the congestion, Transport for Great Manchester warned.Research suggests up to . million car journeys could be made, meaning some unlucky would be beach-goers may find themselves missing out. RAC traffic spokesman Rod Dennis said: After what was one of the quietest Easters on the roads in years, our figures suggest the easing of Covid restrictions has made a dramatic dference, with millions more drivers planning to hit the roads.Becky Mitchell, a meteorologist from the Met Office, said: “We will see highs of C, most likely in parts of Wales and the Midlands and in north-west England as well on Sunday, it’s likely we could get to .C.We are expecting highs of C tomorrow, so the warmest day of the year so far, and both today and tomorrow we will see temperatures in the low s in most parts of the UK, even in northern Scotland.” The weather today is a welcome tonic after one of the worst Mayaposs in living memory.  The month so far has been one dominated by low pressure, bringing heavy downpours or prolonged spells of rain for much of the UK. Wales has seen its wettest May since records began in , with mm of rainfall, well over twice the long-term average, topping the previous record of mm set in .

The letter told them to be gone by Monday unless they can provide evidence of another address as their main residence. Several residents - who pay £, a year to rent the plot - have lived in the park for decades, including one man who has lived there for  years. Residents usually go abroad or stay with family for two months per year. This year they helped each other through lockdown and developed a strong sense of community.

In a joint letter to Jane Hutt, Walesaposs Social Justice Minister, they said: Facing eviction, these people have become acutely stressed and distressed beyond any words I can express.  Many are elderly, most have ploughed le savings into buying static homes where they believed they could remain for the remainder of their lives.

I think the age of eligibility going down every few days has really helped, and will really help us,we can get those people through the doors to be vaccinated asap, she said. It comes as NHS chiefs warned that the lockdown-induced backlog of treatments for ailments other than Covid mean that even a small increase in the number of coronavirus patients could cause hospitals to be overstretched once again.When asked about the possibility of a delay to freedom from restrictions, Environment Secretary George Eustice said nothing could be ruled out. With both deaths and cases up signicantly in the past week, experts are urging the Prime Minister to keep to his data not dates approach to easing lockdown. Prof Gupta told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: It will probably take longer than earlier waves to emerge because of the fact that we do have quite high levels of vaccination in the population, so there may be a  sense of security for some time, and thataposs our concern.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSRadio BBC BreakfastR TodayHospitalsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"covid watchlist identifies 20 hotspots","story":"NewsCovid watchlist identies  hotspots as Indian iant fuels third wave fearsTameside, the city of Manchester, Leeds, Bradford and Leicester have been placed on a coronavirus watchlist by researchers from the weekly Zoe Covid Symptom StudymirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video new-hybrid-indian-kent-covid-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:YuAkiNW,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Reassuringly, we aren’t seeing numbers rise in other surrounding areas. Our data also indicates vaccines are still effective against the Indian iant and this is likely the reason why cases haven’t increased and hospitalisation and deaths remain low. Also important to remind ourselves that our national rates are still amongst the lowest in Europe, despite other countries travel restrictions ” The study also found that a small proportion of people who have been vaccinated against Covid have become infected with the virus. Researchers collected reports from  app users who tested positive for coronavirus despite receiving two doses of a vaccine. A further  reported testing positive after receiving one dose. The study suggests the approximate risk of Covid infection in unvaccinated Brits is  in ,. The estimated risk of catching the virus after one vaccine dose is one in ,, and for those who have received two jabs it is one in ,, said researchers. The study is based on weekly reports from app users and the proportion of newly symptomatic users who have received positive swab tests.

Adam Brookes, , started the £, project in May last year and spent almost six months transforming the entire garden with a climbing frame, monkey bars, mud kitchen, playhouse, rock wall and decked seating area. The project manager worked from home in Stone, Staffordshire, during lockdown and when he was free in the evenings or at weekends he took care of his project to create a dream garden for his we Joanna and their children Reuben, ten, Theodora, six, and Rafferty, four. But one day, Adamaposs saw hit a knot in the wood while building the decking which bounced back into his hand, tearing through his protective gloves and slicing through two arteries. The man was injured and was forced to delay the project by several months. Adam then made a full recovery, but his daughter Theodora fell and broke her arm, so the play area was out of limits for several more weeks.  Adam said had almost completed the project when he was hurt last summer and had to be rushed to hospital by ambulance. The determined dad said: “I was down to the last stages of cutting the decking boards with my chop saw when my saw hit a knot in the wood and kicked back - it got my hand quicker than the guard could get down. “It cut straight through my protective gloves and hand and I lost a lot of blood quite quickly. “I held my hand in a fist and didn’t look at it - I didn’t even knowall my fingers were still there. “I went faint and had to lie in the recovery position and shout for Joanna.” Adam had cut his left hand in between his thumb and finger, just missing the bone and severing two nerves.  The day after arriving at the hospital, he was transferred to a hand specialist in Newcastle for an emergency operation to sew the nerves back together. Adam had to have physio for months because he could not feel the tip of his thumb and couldn not grip very well - but has now regained the use and movement of his thumb. He now often wears a one-digit glove knitted by his mum to keep the thumb warm because of circulation problems caused by the nerve damage. But that did not stop him completing the garden for his family to enjoy. Adam said: “I was very lucky, it could have been a lot worse.”  But when the play area was almost finished, six-year-old Theodora broke her arm and the garden project had to be delayed once again. Joanna said: “We were walking down a steep hill and she just went too quickly and fell. “You could tell straight away her arm was broken, it looked like a boomerang. “She had to have surgery to straighten the bone and then was in a plaster cast for four weeks so she couldn’t really use the play area at first. “But once she built her confidence she was climbing the rock wall one-handed.  We can’t thank the wonderful NHS enough for looking after them both, especially given the current dficult times.” After these two serious injuries and operations, the family finally have their dream garden all finished in time for summer. The children are especially excited about the mud kitchen in their very own adventure playground. Mum said: “They love playing in the mud - they did a Great British Bake off with mud and they’ll make three course meals with drinks from mud as well, it’s great for their imagination. The whole project is even more impressive since it was DIY dad Adam’s first attempt at anything of that scale. Joanna said: “He has no experience of doing anything like that - he just got some tools, watched some videos and learnt as he went along. “He did design drawings and even made a cardboard model of what the kids wanted. “He did it pretty much all by himself except for paying to get the astroturf fitted and the kids painted the fences - but they probably got more paint on their shoes than anywhere !” Now the family are looking forward to enjoying the whole garden together this summer. We Joanna, , said: Last year the garden was a building site, with wood and furniture everywhere. “We can’t wait to have a disaster-free summer to enjoy it. Adam worked so hard on the project and the kids love it - but Iaposm glad to see the back of the electric saws and building work.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSHospitalsHandsYear In LockdownCoronavirus lockdown"},{"url":null,"title":"dads shock 20000 bees descend","story":"NewsDads shock as , bees descend on his car’s number plate like a ‘horror movie’Jon Tribbeck, , was alerted by a neighbour who noticed the infestation and was shocked when he saw how many bees were covering the rear of his vehicle.

Jon Tribbeck, , was alerted by a neighbour who noticed the infestation and was shocked when he saw how many bees were covering the rear of his vehicle. It is not clear why the bees swarmed Jonaposs Audi S, which was parked against a kerb outside his house in Boscombe Down, Wiltshire. The swarm was described as a black cloud which appeared like something out of a horror film. Jon, a self-employed electrical contractor, called a local beekeper who eventually located the Queen and re-homed the bees. The dad-of-two said: It was about nine oaposclock in the morning when a neighbour knocked on my door and asked, aposHave you seen your car apos  I found out later that they had hovered over some neighboursapos lawns earlier that morning. They said it was like a black cloud, and one woman told me her room went dark when they passed her window. People were knocking all day askingIaposd seen my car. I was in complete shock. Itaposs not something you expect to see when you step out of the door in the morning. My sister said it looked like something out of a horror film. Iaposve certainly never seen anything like it before. Thereaposs nothing special about the plate - itaposs not even personalised. Some people said thatI drove the car they would all fly away, but I told them the bees were in for the long haul.  Jon got in touch with beekeeper Mike Gibbs, from the nearby town of Wilton who rushed to assist the stranded honey bees. The beekeeper said: Swarming is an occupational hazard in beekeeping. They can pick anywhere that takes their fancy. Normally they choose low-hanging trees but sometimes they will pick an unusual spot. It had been raining a lot and they were probably looking for some shelter - the ones right up in the plate were bone dry. The Queen is always at the middle of the swarm, so I just grabbed handful after handful of bees and put them in a box until I located her. Then I flipped the box on its lid, made a hole for them to enter and just helped them migrate into the box.  He transported the bees to a hive at one of his apiaries in Downton and left them to build a hive. Mike also stressed the importance of keeping bees alive as populations are declining rapidly. He added: I lost  per cent of my colonies over the winter just gone. I donapost know how it will end up, but we should all be worried about bees and take the decline seriously. We need bees. Though the bees eventually left their new temporary home, Jon admits that he did worry he would never get his car back. He said: I did start to wonderI was ever going to get the car back orit was gone for good. The day after Mike took them there were still a few hundred stragglers which were attracted by the scent left by the Queen.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBeesHoney Bee"},{"url":null,"title":"it turns out im really","story":"AdvertorialIt turns out I’m really good at it - man turns health challenges into sport and TV successHow actor Ekow Otoo went from a teenager facing a debilitating condition to a lead role in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV admirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialThanks to CGI, Ekow is transported into the middle of a Viking invasion in The National Lottery adImagine being a ft in, -year-old man and finding two pizzas too heavy to carry, but not knowing why. That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week* “Getting back into sport was the first step in finding my confidence as a wheelchair user. I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.  Thanks to some clever CGI, viewers watch as he is transported from a street corner into the middle of a Viking invasion, before tearing through a museum and then taking off above the city skyline. At one point Ekow is even flung into the air as he travels through a skate park.

The Duchess of Cambridge has reportedly acted behind the scenes as a peacemaker between her husband and his brother while stepping up royal duties in public. Writing in the Sunday aposs Stella magazine, Camilla Tominey said the mum-of-three, , was fast becoming recognised for how regal an operator she is. And royal biographer Christopher Wilson added that the duchessapos secret to success is in her refusal to become over-awed by drama. What Kate has managed to achieve - and I think in a better way than Princess Diana did - is to combine magic with retaining a sense of the ordinary,apos Christopher told Stella magazine. Diana went off the scale of stardom and disappeared into the stratosphere. Kate has kept her feet on the ground, coming from this determinedly middle-class family, which has in turn helped to ground William too.It comes after a turbulent few months during which Prince Philip passed away and Prince Harry made several bombshell claims about the royal family.Later in May, a damning report led by Lord Dyson found that the BBC had covered up the lies told by Martin Bashir to secure his interview with Princess Diana. Despite the setbacks the duchess has put her best foot forward and even engineered an ice-breaking conversation between Harry and William after the Duke of Edinburghaposs funeral, according to sources.  Last week she shared an image of herself getting the vaccine at Londonaposs Science Museum, adding that she was hugely grateful to everyone involved. And on Friday William and Kate sent a personalised message of thanks to people who they met on their recent Scotland tour. Tominey, who has covered the royal family for more than a decade, said the duchessapos poise under scrutiny and commitment to the job are what make her ready for a future role as queen. She wrote: Her skilful handling of royal crises in recent months suggests that she is fast emerging as the jewel in the monarchyaposs crown.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMartin BashirKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince HarryPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrincess DianaBBCScience MuseumRoyal FamilyJewelleryMuseums"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Zoe Pearce, , is living with lipoedema, an abnormal build-up of fat cells which can affect ious parts of the body.The condition causes inflammation, pain and discomfort, reports Teesside Live.Zoe, from Billingham, County Durham, was diagnosed in  and applied for liposuction in the NHS in  - but was turned down. She is now trying to share information about lipoedema through charity work and her Instagram page to help others.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror. Zoe said: It can’t be changed with diet or exercise, it can only be removed from your body through a special kind of liposuction. It can feel heavy, tingly, fizzy, not very nice, it can be painful as well. But she said there are things you can do to manage the condition, such as being active. Dry brushing, breathing exercises and managing food and drink that can cause inflammation. Pasta causes Zoeaposs legs to get painful, and she no longer drinks alcohol because it causes her legs to fizz and ache afterwards. She has also cut out caffeine and tries to avoid sugar and processed foods.  You still have to live your le, but there’s some foods I know will affect me, Zoe said. Your period can affect it, your hormones,you’re ovulating, some women don’t get diagnosed until their menopause. June is Lipoedema Awareness Month, which is why Zoe is speaking out now. She was diagnosed by Teesside Hospice in  after a referral from her GP. I go in and out of diets constantly and I’d lost three stone but I noticed my legs had got bigger, she said I went to my doctor and she thought I might have lymphedema so she referred me to the hospice.  A specialist at the hospice was able to diagnose her with lipoedema rather than lymphedema, which is a build up of fluid. Two years ago Zoe was told she has Stage  Type , but the condition affects more of her body since her last review. After finding a lump under her armpit and a scan at the breast clinic, she found out the lipoedema has spread to her breasts, as well as already having it in her legs, arms and buttocks. “It’s dferent for everyone, I think I’ve got quite an aggressive type because of how big my legs have got in quite a small space of time,” Zoe said. Some may only experience it in certain places, but signs to look out for include fat pads, knee overhang and saddlebags on thighs. “If you get an early diagnosis you can do a lot to manage the condition so you don’t end up with legs like me, she added.  Zoe has managed the condition as best she can and now posts regularly on social media to raise awareness.Her Instagram account @thickthighs.positivevibes has almost , followers.She also volunteers for Talk Lipoedema, and throughout June the charity is encouraging people to take part in walking challenges and donate. Zoe receives regular messages on Instagram from people who have got a diagnosis thanks to her encouragement. But she knows more needs to be done to raise awareness, especially among medical professionals. “Sometimes doctors think you’re just overweight or it’s just the way you’re built.  “Doctors in this area need to know more about it, it doesnapost cost them to refer so they need to. Knowing the condition will not improve regardless of diet or exercise, Zoe applied for liposuction surgery on the NHS, but was declined in . Her doctor has since appealed on her behalf, but she never heard anything back. The lack of understanding and recognition for the illness has been a source of frustration to Zoe, and she knows it is something she will have for the rest of her le. “I’m worried about ending up in a wheelchair.  “I think my body is going to slow down before my mind,” Zoe said. Things she used to be able to do have become a struggle, such as putting her legs up on the settee. While she used to be able to swing them up, she now has to lt them.  per cent of women are affected, however there’s women out there who have self-diagnosed or who don’t know they’ve got it she said. It’s rarer to be in men but can still happen. She hopes by raising as much awareness as possible that people will understand the condition further and will be able to take more preventative measures. Early diagnosis is so important, not necessarily for us but for the next generation. The more people know about it, the more doctors will refer people on and the NHS may start looking into it and doing research. It is a chronic illness and it’s debilitating, it doesn’t have to progress but we need all the awareness as possible, Zoe said.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnWhatsAppNHSUniversity HospitalGreat North RunHospitalsPregnancyCosmetic surgeryEating disordersMental healthPlastic surgeryTherapyMenopauseFitness"},{"url":null,"title":"mum appalled freezing cold hungry","story":":root Mum appalled by freezing cold Hungry Horse takeout meal for childs birthdayThe woman from Coventry said she wanted to book a table at the Mount Pleasant, a popular pub in the city, but was told they were fully booked.

She told Plymouth Live: I had to try and run to the school which was impossible as I found it hard to walk.I remember feeling very embarrassed when I got to the school, I could hardly breathe and was blood red in the face and was askedI was OK and did I need a glass of water. I was so ashamed, I just wanted to get out of the school as fast as I could.  The woman joined the Slimming World programme in September , with coach Mandy Coles. Victoria said: When I joined I was very ashamed that I had let myself become so big. I knew thatI carried on the way I was eating and drinking I would end up slowly killing myself. In January , Victoria started Couch to k to help her become more active, as well as joining a gym - and now she can run k. So far, Victoria has lost st lbs and said she is much happier with how she looks now.  She said: More importantly I feel much healthier and have so much more energy. My relationship with food is completely dferent. I make much healthier choices now. I also love my exercise, which has been amazing for my mental health which I have struggled with since being a teenager. Before joining Slimming World, Victoria would skip breakfast and eat pasties for lunch.She would then have pasta dishes with lots of garlic bread, as well as snacking on crisps, chocolate and cakes. Now, she has yoghurt and fruit for breakfast and healthy wraps for lunch. Victoria also loves dishes such as cottage pie, hoisin beef, cabbage stir-fry and egg fried rice for dinner.  She said: Planning meals has helped me stay on plan. For me lockdown has made things easier, as I havenapost been able to go out eating and drinking. As Victoria has a little girl, she still has treats and snacks in the house for her, but they each have their own treat boxes. Mine is full of lower-calorie options, she said. Her coach, Mandy, described Victoria as sensational. She said: I’m so proud of Vicky. Her dedication to her journey during these challenging times is such an inspiration to us all. It hasn’t always been easy, but she has just been so determined to achieve her dream. As you can see the transformation has been amazing.

Plastic insulation, which may have helped the flames spread at Grenfell, is also likely to have been used on  hospitals, care homes and sheltered housing, a study by non-combustible insulation firm Rockwool found. Using flammable materials on buildings over m tall was banned following the  blaze in West London, which claimed  lives, but a decision on extending the ban to lower buildings has yet to be made. The first phase of an inquiry into the disaster found aluminium composite cladding was the primary cause of the fire’s spread, but added it was “more likely than not” that plastic insulation contributed. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Geoff Barton, of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the figures estimated by Rockwool using industry data were a “major cause for concern”. Ronnie King, a fire chief for  years and now an adviser to the all-party Parliamentary fire safety and rescue group, added: “You would have thought that the lesson of Grenfell was that you lessen the risk of children being injured or killed.” A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing said: “All materials must pass safety checks before they can be used and our Building Safety Bill will ensure stringent oversight.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEducationHospitalsSchoolsCare homesNursing homesGrenfell Tower fire"},{"url":null,"title":"rishi sunak ate pizza watching","story":"NewsRishi Sunak ate pizza while watching Baywatch on plastic blanket as a childThe chancellor also admitted having a soft spot for Emily in Paris and Blind Date, KFC and Pizza Hut as he laid bare his telly watching habits from days gone bymirrorShareCommentsByTom Horton:,  JUN NewsChancellor Rishi Sunak has given the world an intriguing glimpse of his telly viewing habits \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The government is reportedly set to demand that pupils must be kept at school for another two and a half hours each week. The proposal says that each child will have to have an additional  hours of schooling per year from  after the disruption caused by Covid. Previously it was reported that ministers would consider extending the school day in an effort to catch up with lost learning during the pandemic. School Standards minister Nick Gibb said earlier this year it was one of the proposals being looked at by aposcatch-up tsarapos Sir Kevan Collins.  Mr Gibb told the Commons education committee at the time: Iaposm open to all ideas, we just have to leave no stone unturned in making sure that we can help those young people catch up from the lost education. Now, according to The Times a leaked presentation written by Sir Collins says children will face a -hour week minimum. And officials are reportedly considering an additional year of college for sixth-form studentsteenagers canapost finish their A-levels in time. The publication reports that the -page document was apos per cent completeapos as of April , and a Whitehall source was claimed to have said nothing had changed drastically since then. If the document stays unchanged, the recommendation is said to be for extra time, as well as teaching and tutoring, and that teachers will be given raises to cover the extra hours. Boris Johnson is already said to have been briefed on the report and is prepared to give the go ahead, insiders claimed.Unions previously reacted to the plans with a fresh warning for teachers, who are already working long hours with high workloads. Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, warned ministers against piling fresh pressure on teachers.  “Any proposals to change term times or holidays will need to consider that teachers already work more unpaid overtime than any other profession, and that excessive workload is the reason that many teachers and school leaders leave teaching,” he said. Schools had been physically closed during the national lockdown but re-opened to pupils earlier this year. As part of the easing of lockdown restrictions from May  face coverings for pupils are no longer recommended in secondary schools or colleges - either in classrooms or communal areas. Face masks couldin some schoolsthere are local outbreaks, and twice weekly home testing for school pupils remain in place to control infection rates.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEducationSchools"},{"url":null,"title":"set life results live tonights","story":"NewsSet For Le results LIVE: Tonights draw with winning lotto numbers on Monday, May Whoever matches all the right balls will win £, a month for the next  years on the National Lotterys Set For Le game - and well have all the results live as they drop heremirrorShareByAbigail OLearyReporterUpdated:,  MAY NewsA Set for Le prize of £, a month for a year is among other unclaimed winnings\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-cdn-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news set-le-results-live-tonights- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-cdn-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"Someone could be about to land the windfall of a letime tonight.

Pictures taken on Monday show men, women and children continuing to enjoy the sun - despite the threat of impending eviction.

Richmond Council confirmed on Friday it would begin the legal process to obtain and enforce a Possession Order after its requests for the travellers to move on were rejected.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.

Handed down last month, this denied the authorityaposs request to extend the previous expedited injunction process. Instead, the council is now being forced to go via the courts to remove the group. Councillor Julia Neden-Watts said: A small group of travellers has arrived in Kew.  Council officers will commence the legal action required to expedite their departure. Due to a recent court ruling, this process will not be as fast as residents would like and I know that they will be concerned, but we have to work within the law. As soon as the travellers leave, we will inspect the area and ensure that any damage is repaired, and waste removed. Our park guard officers, along with the police, will be monitoring the site closely until the group depart.  The politan Police said on Sunday that local officers had carried out patrols after the council had served the legal notice.A post on Twitter said: We have conducted further patrols around #KewGreen today and are aware @LBRUT have served notices of seeking possession.We will continue to work with Richmond Council over the coming days on this matter.

Not only does having a full set save you from having to apply coat after coat of mascara or a pair of falsies, but they also fake the appearance of looking bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. However, one woman was gutted after she was left looking like a blobfish.Adelaide Elizabeth headed to the salon to get the procedure done, despite knowing she was allergic to the glue.After waiting for the technician to painstakingly apply each inidual lash to her eye, Adelaide went on her way.But a reaction to the glue that was used left her with red, raw skin and sore eyes.  She said: Remembering that time I decided to get eyelash extensions knowing I was allergic to the glue. Adelaide shared a picture of the after-effects of the reaction on TikTok in a video that has been viewed more than , times. In the snap, huge bags had formed under her eyes, and her eyelids had swollen up.She then posted a side-by-side collage of her puffy face and a blobfish. She annotated the pictures with: HAHAHA LOL. My face actually looked like a blobfish. This comes as a woman shared the horrying consequences of curling her eyelashes once sheaposd applied mascara.In a video thataposs racked up more than . million views on TikTok, the woman, whoaposs known as @roomeyroo, urged people not to make the same mistake she did as she explained where she went wrong. She said she noticed her mistake after nearly all of her lashes had gotten stuck to her eyelash curler. She warned: And THIS is why you NEVER rush your make-up... Iaposm done. They better grow back!! The pain. Someone, please help me, she pleaded.Whilst a few people urged her to curl her lashes before adding product, others suggested that she use castor oil to help them grow faster.

The thirsty pooch had wandered over to the bank of the Chambal India in Rajasthan, India, unaware of the giant beast swimming under the surface. The unsuspecting animal waded through shallow water and began having a drink before the crocodile emerged from the depths and opened its jaws. The dog briefly whimpers in fright before it is dragged underwater by the crocodile, which presumably then drowns its unlucky prey and eats it.Rana Pratap Sagar dam, which contains a number of crocodiles that come to the surface to sunbathe, is just behind where the attack was filmed, reports the Daily Star.The video went viral on YouTube where it ided viewers, with some saying it was the crocodileaposs right to eat and others believing the person filming should have attempted to save the dog. One person wrote: Itaposs not a natural phenomenon, crocodile eating a dog is natural  How can you people say this  This is an incident. If you save the dog then crocodile is not going to die in hunger. Whatthere was a human still gonna say itaposs nature  wrote one.  Someone  simply said: It happens. John Wick will be coming for that crocodile, joked someone , in reference to the blockbuster film about a manaposs bloodthirsty vengeance for his dog. This comes after a crocodile ate a shark in stunning photographs captured in Australia by a stunned witness.

Named the Pulse Concept, the self-flying vehicle is a vision of seamless air and ground travel, and has been created by Brazilian plane firm Embraer. Although it takes into consideration what technology could look like in the future, it is partly inspired by the first concept car, Harley Earl’s Buick Y-Job from . That vehicle – dubbed the car of the future – featured fancul ideas such as hidden headlights, flush door handles, a convertible top concealed by a metal deck, and electrically operated windows. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Embraer’s flying car boasts a glass pod which, attached to swooping wings and tail, can take off and land vertically. When on the ground, the pod is transferred to a wheeled vehicle, creating a seamless transportation loop by moving owners from air to ground without them having to leave the plush capsule. The pod, which relies on future advances in “smart” glass technology and see-through alloy metals, will allow an extraordinary -degree view.Like news to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters Embraer’s designers came up with the Pulse – aimed at high-flying business executives and the wealthy – to mark the th ­anniversary of the company, which sells well-appointed private and commercial planes. The Pulse’s introduction date also depends on the improvement of solid state batteries. The four propellers will be powered by four electric motors. An Embraer spokesman said: “The concept allows travel from destination to destination – not just airport to airport – from the comfort and security of the user’s own personal space.” Elite Traveller magazine said: “As well as revolutionising the way we travel, the Embraer Pulse Concept would completely change the experience, too. “The pod is transparent and the views as you descend on New York, Dubai, Monaco or London would be incredible. “If passengers grow tired of those views, the glass will be interactive, offering them the chance to do work, watch movies or make a video call.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEmbraer SAVehiclesCars"},{"url":null,"title":"uk must give poorer countries","story":"NewsUK must give poorer countries jabs to stop millions dying and new iants, WHO saysTop WHO officials warn a dangerous gap is emerging between rich and poor countries that could create a two track pandemic and room for new mutant iants to spring upmirrorShareCommentsByTalia ShadwellReporterPatrick Daly:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsIt warns of millions more global deaths \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The WHO, the International Monetary Fund, World Bank Group and the World Trade Organisation used a joint plea to call for wealthier countries to give more Covid vaccines to poor nations - or risk new iants bringing fresh outbreaks to Britain.The officials told theand a range of international newspapers a dangerous gap is emerging that could create a two-track pandemicthe problem is not tackled now.They urged wealthier nations to begin donating doses immediately to ensure % of the global population is vaccinated by the end of this year. The officials wrote: Increasingly, a two-track pandemic is developing. Inequitable vaccine distribution is not only leaving untold millions of people vulnerable to the virus, it is also allowing deadly iants to emerge and ricochet back across the world.  Even countries with advanced vaccination programmes have been forced to reimpose stricter public health measures. It need not be this way. The UK is scrambling to curb the spread of the new Indian iant, which is being blamed for driving fresh hotspots in areas including Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen, and Bedford. Britainaposs vaccine rollout is currently being offered to people aged  and above, as nearly million doses have been given nationwide so far. The speed of the UKaposs vaccine rollout bringing hopes of lockdown lting on June  has been tempered by the emergence of new mutant iants. While experts do not believe current vaccines are less effective against the Indian iant, scientists globally have warned the success of vaccine programmes depends on curbing new mutations that could become resistant to the jabs in use. More than  cross-party MPs and peers have urged Boris Johnson to show global leadership in the run-up to the G summit by pledging to do more to vaccinate developing nations.With the Prime Minister chairing a gathering of the most economically powerful countries in the world in Cornwall from June , politicians are calling on him to commit to a one in, one out policy when it comes to vaccines.  For every dose bought for use in Britain, the signatories want the UK Government to donate a dose to the United Nations-backed Covax scheme, which is providing vaccines to low and middle-income countries. In a letter backed by senior Tory MPs Peter Bottomley and Dr Dan Poulter, a former health minister who has worked on the pandemic frontline, the signatories said there is clear moral imperative to act to close the global vaccine ide, as well as a rational case...to stop the threat of iants emerging abroad and taking root in the UK.Others putting their name to the letter include former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, former archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey, former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas, Margaret Thatcheraposs former health minister Baroness Hooper and ex-leader of the Liberal Democrats Lord Campbell.Co-ordinated by the all-party parliamentary groupon coronavirus, the letter said: The longer we wait to act, the more likely it is that dangerous iants could emerge that can evade the protections offered by current vaccines.The UK has an opportunity to use the G summit to show leadership on this critical issue and demonstrate that aposglobal Britainapos is more than just a slogan. While the UK has rightly committed funding to Covax, we remain a net importer of Covid- vaccines.  The APPG on coronavirus therefore recommends that the UK must immediately adopt a policy of vaccine matching, in which for each dose of the vaccine imported, one dose is donated to Covax. This will help meet the urgent demand for vaccines in low and middle-income countries around the world. The UK mustnapost miss the opportunity provided by the G summit to lead the way in promoting more equitable global access to Covid- vaccines. The  peers and MPs said once the UK has boosted its manufacturing capacity, it should aim to become a net vaccine exporter. The decision to write to the Prime Minister comes after Professor Andrew Pollard, who helped develop the Oxford AstraZeneca jabe, warned the group that many millions could die between now and Septembervaccines are not more widely distributed across the globe. The group said European countries, including Germany, France and Italy, had committed to donate at least  million doses of coronavirus vaccines to middle and low-income countries before the end of the year. The UK Government has so far only committed to donating surplus shots in future to Covax, they said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has previously said that the UK has probably done more than any other nation to help vaccinate the worldaposs poorest through its support for the Oxford vaccine, which accounted for almost a third of the global tally of Covid jabs administered as of May . He said the Government had also donated more than £ million to Covax, which has delivered vaccines to  countries and territories.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnWorld Health OrganizationCoronavirus vaccineMutant CoronavirusCoronavirus"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/06/2.37991383-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/06/2.37991383-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/06/2.37991383-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/06/2.37991383-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"caught on camera angus drink driver took tipper truck for a joyride through aberdeen","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remThis is the moment police caught up with an Angus drink driver who stole a tipper truck and went for a joyride in Aberdeen.Matthew Hill took the truck from a building site on Wellington Road just before midnight on Thursday.He was snared by police on Charleston Road North # and he was found to be double the drink-drive limit.Video footage shows two police cars tailing the truck, which appears to still have materials in its bucket.Hill, , had appeared at Aberdeen Sherf Court on Friday and admitted a string of charges.He pleaded guilty to stealing the truck.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began.After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.You can also see the number of cases over time in each health board in the chart below.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of confirmed deaths as well as the confirmed and suspected deaths from the NRS.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

It is too easy to just chop and change and go to the next one but I watched James behind the scenes and I knew what he was doing.“I knew how much it hurt him and how much he was working to get it right.“We were seeing progress even during the times when we may have drawn a game.“You saw progress, you saw a team slowly starting to come together.“We knew we were going to get grief. We knew that James was going to get grief # how does he handle that and how are we going to help him get through that “We did get grief # ‘Why are you still sticking with him ’.“But we don’t now think of that as vindication, that’s our job and that’s what we do.“Like I said before, with all of the hurdles that were put in our path, not just James but everybody, that’s what made the final whistle last Monday so emotional.”Dundee saw off Kilmarnock comfortably in the Premiership play-off and now have trips to Rangers, Celtic as well as top-flight derbies for the first time in five years.Nelms has revealed a change in tack from manager McPake that saw the Dark Blues put their late run together.After a disappointing - home defeat to Ayr United at Dens, McPake’s men responded with a - victory over Alloa.From there they powered up the Championship table, finished in second place before crowning the season with play-off success.Nelms said: “James progressed all the way through. You saw it a little bit before last season was curtailed.“We had the same type of cadence this year where we were trying to find our feet, find a way to play and it actually came down to where he just went, ‘Look, we have to play reality football. We have to win the high balls, the second balls, work for each other and at the end of the day, our qualities will shine through’.“I think in the last  or  games and especially through the play-offs, that’s what you saw.“That’s why we were successful but, yes, James and his staff absolutely progressed over time.“People don’t like to be patient in football but we were patient with James.“We saw what he was doing behind the scenes. If he perceived there was a mistake, he would own it, correct it or do what he could to correct it.“But his work ethic, the way he treats the players, his staff and his single-mindedness to be successful for Dundee Football Club will make James very successful for a long time in this industry.”Dundee#s Jordan McGhee: We#re ready to take on the Premiership right now\" title\"#Dundee#s Jordan McGhee: We#re ready to take on the Premiership right now# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  dundees-jordan-mcghee-were-ready-to-take-on-the-premiership-right-now embed # secretVCMLdnPbe\" data-secret\"VCMLdnPbe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-a-boulder-blasting-came-window--gorbals-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I was born in .

The majority of people have respected our communities and we thank them for that.#However a minority of people are not listening.#A number of unsafe practices were observed theand breadth of Aberdeenshire last summer. Therefore I ask and encourage those people again, not to leave their litter or discard barbecues, campfires and camping equipment.#We appreciate that this will still not be enough on every occasion at every site, sothe in is full # or there isn#t one # take it home.#Scottish comedian Janey Godley said: “It’s no secret that I love Scotland and all the goings on, and I don’t understand why people would want to destroy our wee beauty spots with their rubbish.#When I’m taking my wee sausage dog out for a walk or dragging my daughter on a day trip, I don’t want to be dodging coffee cups, plastic water bottles or sandwich packets.#Take your rubbish home with you or bin it, ye’ve been telt.#Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, urged people to be responsible.He said: #Visitors to green and rural areas will be keen to make up for lost time and we don’t blame them.#We’re joining forces with brilliant partners once again to remind everyone to respect our hills, lochs, parks, and woodlands.

But over the last year, we have been overwhelmed by the support people in Aberdeen have shown towards food banks in our network by donating food at Tesco.#This summer, we would be so gratefulpeople can share shopping lists of their local food bank’s most-needed items on their social media, support the Tesco Summer Food Collection when they are next in-store, and encourage friends and family to donate.

to prove himself at the top level after making the step up to become a category one referee.The -year-old from Aberdeen has been promoted to the highest grade in domestic football having impressed as a category one development official.McFarlane started refereeing in  and is thrilled with his ascent through the ranks.Next season he will be refereeing in League One and Two as well as having the opportunity to be a fourth official at Premiership matches.He said: “It means a lot to me, I did my first game in January  and there has been a lot of hard work and dedication since then.“I’ve been working at it for a long time and in the last few years my progress has been quite rapid.“That’s been good and I’ve put in a lot of effort and it’s been worth it to get to category one.“However, that brings its own challenges now, but it’s been an ambition of mine for a long time so I’m really chuffed.“I was fortunate as a category one development referee to referee matches in League Two this season.I#ve put a lot of effort in and it#s been worth it.# Dan McFarlane on his rise through the ranks“Next season I’ll be doing a mixture of League One and Two and have the opportunity to be fourth official at Premiership matches.“The next challenge is just to adjust the challenges next season and ultimately have a solid first season and hopefully learn from the experienced officials I get a chance to work with.“You only get one chance at it so you’ve got to be up to the challenge.”McFarlane is keen to continue improving and won’t be resting on his laurels.He believes every game he oversees provides him with an opportunity to learn and improve on previous mistakes.He added: “I never come off at the end of a game thinking that I’ve nailed it and got every decision right because there’s an opportunity to learn from every match you referee.“You might have had a good game and got a good mark from your observer, but there is always areas you can improve.“The only way you do that is by acknowledging and learning from your mistakes.“I’ve been at several Highland League games and been getting dog’s abuse from the fans at the end and you’re kind of second guessing yourself.“Then when you watch the highlights backyou’ve got it right you’re pleased, butyou’ve got it wrong you look to try to improve upon it.“That’s the only way you get better and it’s about how you learn from

To use a golfing term there were quite a lot of #shanks# about, with Scott #Lefty# Gargan and Fiona McLeod locked in battle with their mates John Kennedy and Dorothy Clark, who had a vice-like grip on the match, whipping ahead -.In the league cross-over game, dark horses Mark Harkness and Richard Dewar were put to the sword by the evergreen Sandy Crawford and young Murray MacDonald.Neither of the two to-guns were wearing a mask on the green, but they ought to have as they robbed the dark horses at the last post to ride into the sunset with victory by an - margin.The week#s star pair were undoubtedly Anne Moore and Libby McGuinness, who were in cruise control for most of their match against Roddy MacDonald and Jamie MacLean.The Penelope Pitstop and Dick Dastardly of this whacky race left only scorched tyre tracks as they sped to an impressive - victory, despite Libby#s concern that the Arkansas Chuggabugs had a secret weapon, to pull out six shots in the last end.As the next round approaches, Guy and Ward willto the gym the undertaker will need to resurrect his form, the postman will need to deliver and the tea table out at Lingerton will be ided, with some cups tasting just that bit sweeter.With the Portavadie Cup, for the seasons most consistent player, well underway, a few players have posted notable wins with Liz Long notching her first three pointer and Colin #Last Bowl# MacInnes remaining unbeaten."},{"url":null,"title":"cash jump for youth football","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"summer in the garden roses and relaxing","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The carvings are located inside the cairn on the capstone of an Early Bronze Age burial cist.Kilmartin Glen has one of the most important concentrations of Neolithic and Bronze Age remains in Scotland, including some of the finest cup and ring markings in the country.Dr Tertia Barnett, principal investigator for Scotland’s Rock Art Project at Historic Environment Scotland , said: #It was previously thought that prehistoric animal carvings of this date didn’t exist in Scotland, although they are known in parts of Europe, so it is very exciting that they have now been discovered here for the first time in the historic Kilmartin Glen.#This extremely rare discovery completely changes the assumption that prehistoric rock art in Britain was mainly geometric and non-figurative.#While there are a few prehistoric carvings of deer in the UK, the only other ones created in the Early Bronze Age are very schematic. It is remarkable that these carvings in Dunchraigaig Cairn show such great anatomical detail and there is no doubt about which animal species they represent.#This also tells us that the local communities were carving animals as well as cup and ring mots which is in keeping with what we know of other Neolithic and Bronze Age societies, particularly in Scandinavia and Iberia. Until now, we did not know of any area in Britain with both types of carvings, which poses questions about the relationship between them and their signicance to the people that created them.#Following Hamish’s discovery, experts from Scotland’s Rock Art Project examined the carvings to confirm their authenticity. This included utilizing innovative technology in their analysis. A structured light scan was carried out by HES digital documentation experts to create an accurate and detailed D model with photographic texture, and ious visualisation techniques were then applied to the model in order to reveal more details of the carvings than would have been visible to the naked eye.Dr Barnett added: #Digital techniques are being used more and more frequently to create precise D models of rock art and reveal details that were previously unknown to us, or that we only suspected.#Digital technology is becoming increasingly important for archaeology, and particularly for rock art, and is a key to unlocking the hidden secrets of our past. This incredible discovery in Dunchraigaig Cairn makes us wonderother animal carvings previously unknown to the UK are hidden in unexpected places in our ancient landscapes, waiting to be uncovered in the future.#The cairn, which is in care of HES, is m wide and contained three stone burial chambers, or cists. The third cist, where the carvings are located, was dug directly into the ground, lined with drystone cobbled walls and capped with an unusually large stone over .m long. The remains of up to  iniduals, some cremated, were also discovered here when the site was initially excavated in the s, as well as artefacts including a whetstone, a greenstone axe and a flint kne.Hamish Fenton said: #I was passing Dunchraigaig Cairn at dusk when I noticed the burial chamber in the side of the cairn and decided to slide inside with my torch. As I shone the torch around, I noticed a pattern on the underside of the roof slab which didn’t appear to be natural markings in the rock. As I shone the light around further, I could see that I was looking at a deer stag upside down, and as I continued looking around, more animals appeared on the rock.#This was a completely amazing and unexpected find and, to me, discoveries like this are the real treasure of archaeology, helping to reshape our understanding of the past.#The cairn is currently closed while HES carries out further evaluation and puts measures in place to protect the extremely rare, and delicate, ancient carvings.Kilmartin Museum curator Dr Sharon Webb MBE said: #The archaeology of Kilmartin Glen is extraordinary, and every new discovery adds to its international importance. Future research will help us to understand how this amazing and unique art fits into the story of the Glen, which is really exciting.#We’re in the process of rebuilding the museum with £. million redevelopment and we’ll be including interpretations of this rock art in the new exhibitions when they open in .#PICS:Deer antlers can be seen carved into the rock. no_aPrehistoricCarvingsAn impresion of the rock art, by Hamish Fenton. no_aPrehistoricCarvings_HamishFentonDr Joana Valdez-Tullett, research assistant at Scotland#s Rock Ar, investigates the site at Dunchraigaig Cairn. no_aPrehistoricCarvingsDr Tertia Barnett, principal investigator at Scotland#s Rock Art Project, Historic Environment Scotland. no_aPrehistoricCarvings"},{"url":null,"title":"making it easier to get around lochgilphead","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy running a mok but please do so safely","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"inez picks up prizes amid winning streak","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in.

From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types, providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and Midsummer#s Day arrives, here are few #must do# jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:CAPTION:June is the perfect month for creating an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.

This provided learners with the opportunity to see new words and phrases and gave fluent speakers the chance to use Gaelic outside the classroom.It was the young learners who really caught the judges# attention though, with their production, Èirich.Èirich tells the story of a social media trend that transports people into a dangerous new world, with some students caught in an infinite loop and others caught by the #person in the shadows#.Councillor Robin Currie, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, said: #Every year this competition attracts a huge number of high quality entries from learners across Scotland, and it is an honour that our young people made it to the final.#These talented filmmakers from Islay High School have created two exceptional productions and I#m very, very proud of them.#Gaelic has played an important role in the history of Argyll and Bute for many, many years and we#re committed to continuing to promote the language and its culture to our communities.#Gaelic education is offered in more than  of our primary schools and five secondary schools.#There has been an increase in interest in Gaelic Medium Education, which will have a positive impact on future generations of Gaelic speakers.

Mr Mitchell acknowledged receipt of these answers.I was alarmed and saddened by the headline #Failing# school is #betraying# pupils and the community# in last week#s Courier.Coming from a retired Campbeltown Grammar Schoolteacher, it is hard to believe that someone who has worked in the profession could have such criticism for his her fellow colleagues.Although clearly passionate about the future of CGS, perhaps retirement has helped this inidual forget what a challenging job all school staff face.It is commonly known that CGS has not had its troubles to seek in recent years with major staff shortages due to ill health and other unforeseen circumstances.The league tables do not make good reading but, on their own, I don#t think they reflect the efforts of the staff.It is a well known fact that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Is the behaviour of pupils the greatest barrier to success Despite the efforts of teachers to discipline the pupils, there are few deterrents for the offenders, especially where the pupil is aware that,they ask, the parent will fight their corner instead of backing the school.The responsibility of teaching our children to behave and respect others needs to be instilled from early years by us all and not just when the child reaches CGS.Maybe the retired teacher should offer his her skills and visit CGS and see the problems that all staff are facing It is time for the community to pull together and support our school and encourage our children to believe that a good education is very achievable in CGS.Recently, an investigation by the Herald newspaper uncovered that #just over half of Scotland#s leline ferry network is operating outwith its working le expectancy#, with  vessels out of  in operation over  years old.Despite the huge challenges created by the Covid- pandemic that our hard-working ferry crews have to deal with,  residents rightly expect a high quality ferry service that runs on time and has enough space to ensure they can travel to and from the islands, businesses can transport goods to the mainland and tourists can visit our islands to boost the economy.Unfortunately, cancellations and delays continue to plague routes. I have been working closely with residents, our community councils and other parties to find long-term solutions.This pressing matter simply can#t be left on the backburner.The  National Lottery Awards are now open for entries.Once again, the annual search for the UK#s favourite National Lottery-funded people and projects will recognise those iniduals and organisations who have made an extraordinary impact in their community – especially during these unprecedent times.National Lottery players raise £ million every week for good causes and we know this money is being used in amazing and inspiring ways.As part of The National Lottery Awards, we want to celebrate those whose selfless dedication and fantastic work makes such a dference in villages, towns and cities across the country.Encompassing all areas of National Lottery funding, you nominate local legends and hometown heroes in the following categories: culture, arts and film, community charity, heritage and sport.In addition, there will be a young hero award for someone under the age of .Groups or organisations are eligible to enter The National Lottery Project of the Year category, where shortlisted finalists will face a public vote later in the year.All award winners will receive an iconic National Lottery Awards trophy and £, for their organisation.Nominations can be made by completing an entry form on our website at www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk awards.All nominees must have been funded by The National Lottery or be associated with a National Lottery funded project.

Play is a hugely important part of childhood and has a whole host of benefits, including improving physical and mental health and wellbeing.Throughout this pandemic, children have had to deal with so many dficult challenges some having to stay in unsafe homes and many living with families who are struggling with health worries and financial issues.Children have told Childline that they have struggled to cope and their mental health has suffered as a result.It doesn#t matter how people choose to play this Childhood Day , whether it#s organising a sponsored kickabout in the park, a game of cards, a musical get-together or an online gaming tournament, we just want as many as possible playing and raising money to help us keep children safe.We look forward to hearing how your readers plan to support the NSPCC and children across Scotland this Childhood Day.To find out more and download a fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or search online for NSPCC Childhood Day."},{"url":null,"title":"look out little explorers about","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is a big commitment for the school, requiring  hours of #on site# work.After finding out about Scottish-born American naturalist John Muir, his love for nature and his environmental work, the children mapped along their nearest beach and undertook a beach clean.Nearby, the pupils discovered a trig point and a lookout or watchtower.They are interested in finding out more about Kintyre#s lookout towers and are appealing to Courier readers with any information or stories to send them letters to: Rhunahaorine Primary School, Tayinloan, Tarbert, PA XG.Some of the children are also interested in the rocks on the beach beside the lookout tower at Rhunahaorine.They collected ious examples and took turns smashing them in the hope of finding geodes – crystals or other mineral matter – inside. They discovered lots of interesting patterns but no real geodes – this is perhaps a lelong project for some.Other pupils are interested in the shells and crabs on the beach.

Did he feel embarrassed in front of his friends who did not share his doubts, did he feel ashamed that his faith had not remained resolute or was he able to put those feelings aside and share the joy of the risen Lord We do know that Thomas responded with the words: #My Lord and my God.#More than two thousand years later, we may feel embarrassedour faith falters and doubts set in.However, we should focus on the happiness of which Jesus speaks.Have the strength and hope to echo the words of Thomas: #My Lord and my God.#Do not beat yourself up for doubting – have the strength to believe."},{"url":null,"title":"author meyrick moves into gangland territory","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

James VI also came to the Bass in  as a guest of a later Lauder he liked the island so much that he offered to purchase it, but here he was snubbed.During the reign of Charles II, the Bass became a notorious prison, mainly used for the Covenanters.As many as  of these religious dissidents were held on the island, under appalling conditions: there was a well that produced fresh water, but fresh meat was a scarcity and the fishy taste of the seabirds was a torment to the wretched prisoners.In , four Jacobite officers were imprisoned on the Bass but they successfully took over control of the island and ordered the garrison to depart. After reinforcements had been received, they withstood a siege of nearly three years, under trying conditions, before they surrendered with full military honours in May .The Bass later passed into the ownership of the Dalrymple family, to which it still belongs today.The Bass Rock lighthouse was constructed in  by the celebrated engineer David Stevenson, a cousin of Robert Louis. He made sure that parts of the old castle were demolished for the stone to be harvested to build the -metre lighthouse, which served its purpose well for many years to come.It was lit with gas derived from vaporised paraffin oil for many years, monitored by the lighthouse keeper.Since , when the lighthouse was converted to electricity and remotely controlled, the lighthouse keeper was no longer needed, and the Bass Rock has been without any permanent human resident.From his house lsquoRockstowesrsquo on Melbourne Road, the celebrated postcard artist Reginald Phillimore enjoyed uninterrupted views of the Bass Rock.He had a fascination with the island, visited it many times and wrote a guidebook that he published himself.The Bass Rock is home to the largest gannet colony in the world: , birds spend their summer residence here, having been in Africa for the winter.The gannet, or lsquosolan goosersquo as it was known in Phillimorersquos time, is a large and formidable-looking seabird, with a white body, a yellow neck and head, and black and white speckled wings and tail.The reason that much of the Bass Rock appears white from a distance is the sheer number of birds and their acrid droppings.The gannet hunts fish by ing headlong into the sea, as any visitor to the Bass Rock can observe at close range.The air is full of birds, which are squawking cacophonously, and the smell from their droppings is very noticeable.Phillimore made some beautul postcards featuring the Bass Rock gannets he is likely to have travelled to the island from Canty Bay or on a vessel from North Berwick, but nowadays access to the Bass can be arranged via the Scottish Seabird Centre.This is an edited extract from Jan Bondesonrsquos book R.P.

It was also planned to add an indoor area including a kitchen for campers.Mrs Ritzema added that, given the ldquosignicant growth in glamping, additional units would be provided subject to consultation and the necessary planning consents.She added that the seven staff members, one of them part-time, who worked at the site had been retained, with a recruitment process under way for a further three or four new employees.They either live on-site or in the local area, including Angie Purves, an East Lothian resident who has been promoted from office manager to take over the running of Drummohr.Mrs Ritzema said that everyone involved in the venture was ldquomadly excited by it all and added that a new website for the site would highlight local visitor attractions.Richard Prestwich, director in the leisure and trade team at Savills, said: ldquoHoliday parks have become exceptionally sought-after due to the growing trend for staycations.

These animals are easily adaptable to a iety of habitats: from meadows to woods to city streets. They can also survive on a wide range of food, such as small mammals, invertebrates and fruit, but they will take advantage of food discarded by people.Foxes are social animals who live in small groups that consist of a breeding male , a femaleand their cubs. Usually, the male and female bond for le but there will be occasions when the male may seek additional mating opportunities.Mating takes place in winter and this is when foxes are most vocal. If you happen to have a window open on a winter night and you hear a loud screaming noise that sounds like a high-pitched screech, it is most definitely a fox looking for a mate and fending off its rivals.In spring, females give birth to several cubs, which become fully self-sufficient by autumn when they leave their parents. Some cubs may decide to stay with their family and they will play a big part in raising the following yearrsquos litter.My adventure with foxes started not that long ago. I was always fascinated by them but never really happened to photograph them. Occasionally, I was lucky to catch a glimpse of a fox but usually it was late in the evening or in a dense woodland, where photo opportunities are low.At the beginning of this year, I promised myself that I would find a family of foxes and get some decent shots. You may not believe it, but I spent weeks studying Google Maps in search of the best spots in East Lothian that I would visit everything marked green or looking like an open space was in scope for investigation.As spring progressed, I started to become more and more lucky with foxes. I reached the point when I could see them almost each time I left the house. I have taken multiple images, but I was never happy with them, until one dayhellipIt was a sunny Saturday morning when I decided to go out and look for deer. I visited a local meadow and quickly spotted a roe deer buck which I decided to follow. I did not manage to take any photos of the deer because as soon as I rushed after him, a beautully coloured fox crossed my path. Every day thenceforth I was coming back home with more information about the fox that I found. Finally, I was rewarded with some lovely shots in the setting sun! This is something I was dreaming of for so long! These animals are fantastic and I have completely fallen for them .Now, with lockdown eased, I hope you will have a chance to spend more time outdoors and hopefully see some lovely foxes. Evenyou donrsquot spot them on your walk, donrsquot give up! Look for some signs which may indicate of their presence: fox pooor their underground burrow .Scats are usually easily identiable as they are twisted and contain bits of fur and bones. They are deposited at prominent spots such as on footpaths, stumps, posts or rocks. The den is nothing  but a circular hollow in the groundyou are brave enough to lower yourself and snf it, you will smell a strong and unpleasant scent. Foxes secrete this smelly odour to mark their territories but it also helps to distinguish iniduals . They also have scent glands on their feet, so they mark their well-used trails as they walk ndash this is quite helpful to effectively navigate at night.If you would like to share your fox sightings with me or advise about good photography spots, please get in touch. I will also be delighted to chat anything wildle, so please do come up to say helloyou see me out and about with my camera.Speak to you next month!www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww.instagram zans_lenswww zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-lodged-crematorium-near-musselburgh","story":"East Lothian Council will now consider the project from the Westerleigh Group, a developer and operator of crematoria and cemeteries, with  facilities in England, Scotland and Wales.A single-storey crematorium, of around m internally, which would house a -seat chapel, is planned in the larger of two fields on the site.There would be a waiting room, accessible toilets, administration office, crematory, covered walkway and floral tribute area.Car parking providing  spaces, including six disabled accessible bays and an additional four spaces for staff parking, and memorial gardens are also planned.George Bell, regional manager for north and east from Westerleigh Group, said: \"There is a pressing need for a crematorium in East Lothian.\"East Lothian does not have a crematorium of their own and their residents currently have to travel long journeys into Edinburgh, through busy roads, to access a crematorium.\"The area already has a large population base and this is going to grow further in the coming years, with some signicant new housing developments being planned.\"If our planning application is successful, this new crematorium will also serve the wider Edinburgh City region.\"We pride ourselves on creating and maintaining crematoria which are welcoming, attractive places for remembrance and reflection, and which are true assets to their local communities.\"The teams at all our crematoria have proudly earned a reputation for providing exceptional care and support to local people, enabling families to remember, mourn and celebrate the lives of their loved ones in a way that is uniquely personal, and we look forward to hopefully being able to bring that same high level of service to the people of East Lothian.\"Earlier this year, we conducted a public consultation exercise and were delighted to receive a positive response.\"The full planning application has now been submitted and we hope to receive a decision in early autumn.\"The site of the proposed development is around  acres, located north of the village of Old Craighall. It is located to the south of the slip road linking the eastbound A to the westbound A and these form the northern and eastern boundaries of the new crematorium. The western boundary is formed by Old Craighall Road and the southern boundary is formed by a minor road linking Old Craighall Road with the eastern part of Dalkeith Country Park.A planning statement, issued on behalf of the company by Holder Planning, said: \"The application site is in a very accessible location.

Naw, no way ever, sorry aunty, your walks on this trip have been long enough!And so they set off for Rannoch Moor, which meant adrive along the old road, back through the ancient Caledonian pinewood to Bridge of Orchy.As Izzy approached the bridge, her stomach sank as she relived the events of an hour ago.When Mary had made her first desperate cry to Finn, he had thankfully just closed his door so hadnrsquot heard but Izzy had. Shersquod had no choice but to rapidly set off with music playing loudly. The heartbreaking image of Mary in her rear view mirror, begging her to stop, was something she would never forget. It made her feel sick with guilt.Izzy was now desperate to speak to Ewen, to find out why the hell his mother was there in the first place after shersquod been so clear she couldnrsquot cope with being involved. And leaving the scarf, that wasnrsquot part of the plan either.Doubts and anxiety about the trip once again surfaced in Izzyrsquos mind. It had been so carefully planned to keep Finn safe, but now it seemed to be unravelling. The incident at Bridge of Orchy had unnerved Izzy to the extent she was no longer sure she could trust Ewen to keep to the arrangements they had painstakingly put together.The more she thought about it, the more she began to realise that ending the trip and taking Finn home would be the safest thing to do.But her mind was torn in a dilemma. She could see he was enjoying and benefitting from the adventure. As shersquod hoped, the landscape, the stories and immersion in nature had created a new emotional space for Finn. The Highlands were working their magic and Finn was slowly opening up his anxiety seemed less and he was managing his anger better. His regular calls to his mum were vital to maintain this, but there were signs that this trip, as Izzy had hoped, could be a seed for healing.And, besides, Finn had already made it clear he didnrsquot want the journey cut short. If she did so now, how could she explain her decision to him  She would have to make something up and he would feel so let down, probably assume he was to blame.As Izzy drove over the bridge, her mind swirled with indecision. She reached the junction with the main road, then hesitated. Head north to Rannoch Moor, or south and take Finn home  It was late afternoon now, with perhaps three hours of daylight left.ldquoCome on aunty, there are no cars, you can go.Izzy made her decision: she turned left and headed north.A distant view of the Caledonian wood was suddenly blocked by a dense plantation of Sitka spruce by the road. Then Loch Tulla reappeared into view, its banks littered with naturersquos debris, landed there during previous flooding by the loch.Before they began their ascent to Rannoch Moor, they passed the ruined castle at Achallader. Its tower was clearly visible in the distance, a jagged tooth standing defiantly but dwarfed by the mountains beyond.It was yet another fortress built by Black Duncan, this time on land taken from the Fletchers, so the story goes, by devious means. The conniving Campbell chief engineered a deadly confrontation between one of his servants and the head of the Fletchers. The sad result was the murder of the servant by the Fletcher, all part of Black Duncanrsquos plan. It was done in the heat of the moment, but murder it was, and Fletcher would hang for itcaught and tried. Duncan ensured he himself was witness to the incident, so he had Fletcherrsquos fate in his palm. So upon Duncanrsquos advice, the Fletchers fled, leaving the land to be acquired by the cunning Campbell chief, who promptly had a tower built by the farm to mark his possession of it.ldquoJust like a dog pees on lampposts to mark his territory, commented Finn.ldquoWhat an image, but yes! laughed Izzy. ldquoAnd it guards the edge of his Campbell estate, as well as the droversrsquo route. From here, we climb up to Rannoch Moor.The road curved as it climbed to give a spectacular view over Loch Tulla and the peaks of the great wall of Rannoch, a mountain boundary on the south of the moor. Izzy had travelled this way many times, but her anticipation was undiminished: Rannoch Moor is a wild place seeped in legend and history, not a few ghosts, and an unpredictable temper.Izzy pulled up at a layby on the edge of the moor and turned to look at her nephew.ldquoWersquore going on a walk, arenrsquot we  he said despondently. He looked around. It was all empty moorland with distant mountains. ldquoWe are in the middle of nowhere, aunty, what are we going to see ldquoI will be honest, Finn, itrsquos not far but it may be boggy and wet underfoot. But itrsquos a place of special meaning for me and I really want to share it with you.He looked down at his boots, then gave her an affirmative smile.ldquoOK then, I suppose so far I havenrsquot regretted going on your lsquoshortrsquo walkshellip much!They set off onto the moor but kept not far from the road. They leapt between mounds of wispy grass and bog myrtle, trying with limited success to avoid boggy areas. Soon Finn could see what he guessed was their destination: a large boulder with a tree growing from the top of it.It was a lsquogiantrsquos stonersquo but not as large as Samsonrsquos Putting Stone. Izzy climbed to the top with an ease that suggested shersquod done it before and gave Finn a hand up. They both sat under the branches of the tree, a small weather-beaten rowan, looking out to the mountains which they had passed on their journey. Cars whizzed by on the nearby road, but soon Finn became unaware of their fleeting presence as he listened to his auntrsquos words.ldquoHow it seeded in this unlikely place, I canrsquot say, she said. ldquoPerhaps a careless bird dropped a berry and couldnrsquot retrieve it. But however the seed arrived, it sprouted and grew from this small crack on the boulderrsquos summit. This tree survives on meagre ground and in an exposed position, howling winds have bent its spines. Irsquove seen it in all seasons, resplendent with berries in autumn, battered by freezing winter gales, its naked branches turned white by frost, wearing a coat of blossom in spring. Its le here seems impossible, yet it survives. Each time I pass on tour, I slow my coach and say hello under my breath. But when I am on a personal journey, I often stop and keep it company for a while.ldquoKeep it company aunty, really ldquoItrsquos alone, Finn. Trees connect with each other just as humans do, although in dferent ways of course. They crave the company of their kind, their roots intertwine as we might give each other hugs. But this beautul tree is lonesome.ldquoI donrsquot think trees get lonely, aunty, they donrsquot have feelings like we do.Izzy bent her knees up to her chin and wrapped her arms around her legs, staying silent in thought for a moment before replying.ldquoMaybe yoursquore right, Finn, perhaps itrsquos that trees can help us recognise our own feelings. You know, when we see their struggles, they remind us of our own. They are living things too and I think they can understand.Finn peered up at the tree. A few red berries hung from its wilted branches. From a distance, it had looked defiant, but close up it looked, well, precarious perhaps even anxious, clinging onto its almost bare rock for survival. He didnrsquot want to admit it out loud, but he did understand what his aunt was saying he too could feel a connection to the rowanrsquos struggle.As they sat either side of the tree squeezed on top of the boulder, Izzy told a story. Finn wasnrsquot sureit was for him or the tree probably both, he reckoned. It was a story he would long remember, more deeply than he could have imagined he would.They walked back to the car silently, carefully re-treading their steps to avoid sinking ankle deep in bog. Midges buzzed in the air but didnrsquot bother. It was getting very cool and breezy darkening clouds were making the sky seem angry.ldquoThe mood of the moor is changing, reflected Izzy out loud. ldquoYou ready to see what lies beyond that ridge Here are the links to chapters one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, , , , ,  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-added-location-mobile-coronavirus-testing-units-east-lothian-next-week-revealed","story":"The units offer Covid- tests to those who have no symptoms of the virus.As nearly one in three people who have Covid- donrsquot show any of the usual symptoms, itrsquos possible for people to be passing the virus on to loved ones and people in the community.By getting tested ndash evensomeone feels fine and has received vaccination ndash they can find outthey are positive and take immediate action to stop the spread of the virus to others by self-isolating.A fixed testing centre, located at the former Stoneyhill Community Centre in Musselburgh, continues to operate from Tuesdays to Saturdays from am to pm.

When the apprentices hauled him on board, they saw he was the old man whom theyrsquod seen in the chart room the night before. The captain of the wrecked boat.These are the stories that attracts Gill Russell, the artist behind the new An Lanntair exhibition named after this tale, itself found after trawling through the extensive collection on Tobar an Dualchais, the always fascinating audio archive of stories and songs and memories collected by field recorders from the School of Scottish Studies at the University of Edinburgh from Gaelic and Scots communities from the s onwards.Russell, herself based in Strathdon, yet having travelled frequently to the Western Isles since childhood, spent countless hours searching through the archive, and then, too, speakingto islanders who could tell her ofthe connections between land andthe sea in the Hebrides.Russellrsquos work is in mapping the environment, although not in an Ordnance Survey sense. She is drawn to places of signicance, whether mythological or geographical or other ndash her many collaborations with the poet artist Alec Finlay in recent years attest to this, too.There is a seeking out of stories and information, of names and places, and of how they are marked. She maps the routes of rivers from source to sea in visual veins ndash she calls them ldquotributrees. She marks the names of shipwrecks ndash in position ndash on a page without marking the islands around which they are wrecked, and gives the importance of the names to the invisible coastline on which, or off which, they foundered.She maps the near-lost names of the skerries and rocks in the Sound of Harris, now deemed obsolete by many modern mariners ndash although perhaps not all ndash who rely on satellite navigation to chart the tortuous course through the skerry-strewn passage between Leverburghand Berneraywhich would previously have been done by learned knowledge, and reading of the signposts of sea and land.ldquoItrsquos incredible because the Sound of Harris is almost more land than sea, she tells me of this last section of the project. ldquoI became fascinated by the Loch Portain ferry weaving through these rocks.Russell made what she has called a ldquoschematic amonochrome circular image made up of names and of the signals of the navigation buoys on the route. ldquoI became quite geeky about it, she laughs, ldquoI was fascinated by the way they inidually flash and what that means. I like to mix up the heritage with the modern stuff!The names themselves came from the book, The Sea Names of Berneray, by Donald McKillop, and from Cal Mac ldquomotorman Donald Maclean, interviewed extensively in the exhibition, ldquowho grew up eight metres from the high water line in Berneray and jumped on any boat going anywhere.ldquoHe knows the loch and the Sound of Harris, and how really important those names were, how essential it was to know the names of the skerries to describe how to get places, says Russell.ldquoAnd it was then I began to realise that Irsquom the spectator, the tourist, and that I needed to find the authentic voices in the aural histories.She has collected it all here, and in a book that accompanies the exhibition, a reckoning of the marine heritage of the islands, of the voices of the past and a history that is ghosted over the present.South West by South - An T-Eilean Fada, The Long Island: A Poetic Cartography, An Lanntair, Kenneth Street, Stornoway, Lewis,   lanntair, Until  July, Tues-Wed, am-pm, Thurs-Sat, am-lateCritics ChoiceMaking use of the posters for cultural events that didnt happen because of Covid last year and a hard-working shredding machine, artist Laura McGlinchey has created Paper Cave, a walk-in installation in a glass-fronted bakery art space in Ayr. Nurture Narture, itself the brainchild of father-daugther duo, Robert and Saskia Singer, during the first lockdown, has grown into an artists collective based around a bakery in the historic centre of Ayr, and McGlinchey, who first created Paper Cave during lockdown last year, has been reworking her idea in this new public space, spending the last four weeks creating the painstaking cave from scratch, fully ndash intentionally - in sight of anyone passing by.The materials themselves are gleaned from the local environment, not least with the help of the community, from paper, seaweed and cardboard to bits of plastic, shaving foam and flour.

Responding to an initial written question, a Minister would read out a turgid civil service response, then subside gratefully, hoping for a y supplementary to catch his breath.Up from the Labour side would bound Tam, to declare in his sonorous Etonian tones: ldquoHow much  Or, even better: ldquoWhy  Cue startled Minister.I thought of Tam when I pondered the question of a putative co-operation deal between the SNP Scottish Government and the Greens. Recalling my journalistic coaching, I asked: ldquoWho, what, when, where, why :Now Swinney has moved on, how will we sort out Scotlandrsquos struggling schools We know who: two parties, of dferent stature, supporting independence with ying degrees of fervour.We know what: a co-operation agreement short of full coalition. Eventually, there might be Green Ministers. For now, too soon.More to the point, the Greens stress they would reserve the right to dissent on certain specied issues. Which means no collective governmental responsibility. Which means no Ministers, for now.When  The talks are said to be at an early stage with months of discussion to come. Where  Holyrood.The big question, though, is why. One observer tells me that the Green co-leaders, Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, seemed faintly taken aback at the initial ldquotalks about talks. Warily and sensibly, they stressed the need to consult colleagues.However, they have agreed to continue negotiating, noting en passant that they have secured concessions in recent Budget deals.There is history here. In , Alex Salmond led a minority administration. He tried to strike a partnership deal with the Liberal Democrats. That fell apart: key LibDems found the SNP and independence fundamentally unpalatable.Mr Salmond then turned to the Green MSPs. All two of them. The leader Robin Harper, with his permanent smile and Dr Who scarf. And Patrick Harvie, an astute politician even then.Again, a full partnership proved impossible, owing to a dispute over transport policy among other issues. A compact was signed to support the election of Mr Salmond as First Minister.That was not really needed: subsequent history proved that the party with the most MSPs would, in practice, be permitted by Parliament to enter office.They said they had been sold short. Mr Swinney was, to put it mildly, less than pleased. That memory no doubt lingers in the mind of the Deputy First Minister as he contemplates the new round of talks.So, again, why  Especially now, when the SNP are just one short of an overall majority in Holyrood.I sought answers from my Herald Podcast  among the number, Kezia Dugdale, who formerly led Labour and now heads the John Smith Centre. She disclosed that she had conducted extensive research, including a phone call to a pal in New Zealand, where there has been cross-party co-operation.She was advised that the Greens there felt they gained clout and influence. Labour leaders felt they gained extra security, including a pact which obviated the need for tense annual Budget talks.:Is independence inevitable or can unionists rescue the realm they cherish The deal has persisted, even though Labour won a majority last year. Some Greens are discontented.Scottish Green sources point to the New Zealand model, stressing the capacity to criticise the administration. They are less enthusiastic about the example of Ireland where some Greens fear their ideology risks being swamped in a compact with centre-right parties.Either way, it is, partly, about money. Nicola Sturgeon and Kate Forbes want to pre-empt the annual agony of Budgetary negotiations by securing potential support in advance.Not an easy sell. SNP Ministers are adamant they will stick to an income tax freeze for the duration of this Parliament. Greens favour a more radical approach to revenue, as they would see it, including a possible wealth taxa way could be found.But compromise could be reached. There will be other obstacles, such as Green opposition to road building. The FM said this week that dualling the A, for example, will not be halted.Then there is the North Sea. The parties dfer over the pace of shting away from oil and gas. With the COP  UN climate conference due in Glasgow, the SNP may be ready to give yet more ground, while protecting north-east jobs.Always, of course, there is independence. Would a compact add more impetus to the case for indyref  Not, I suspect, in terms of influencing the UK Government. But it would perhaps be a reminder of the ersity of support for independence.There is, however, a third motivation, beyond cash and indyref. The SNP have been in power for  years. The previous Holyrood session had a toxic tang: Brexit independence arguments and Nicola Sturgeon gazing fretfully over her shoulder at her ever-present predecessor.I believe the FM wants a fresh approach. Literally, a new politics. Sceptics will say this is purely about presentation. I think it is also strategic. By making a choice, by making a new alliance, Ms Sturgeon hopes to banish staleness from her own party, and simultaneously challenge rivals to refresh.She hopes, in so doing, to isolate the Tories. They respond by warning that the Greens will push her in an anti-business direction.She hopes, also, to challenge Labour, over policy and indyref. Anas Sarwar was, understandably, ill-prepared. His first response was simply to revive an old Labour theme, deriding the recreation of a spending cuts coalition.He will need a new tone, new phrases.

Cummings was part of it too. He admitted he didnrsquot advise the PM to seriously consider lockdown until it was already too late.Cummings also saved the bacon of the hapless Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, by accusing him of repeatedly lying. Boris Johnson was forced to back his Cabinet minister, thus saving him from the chop in the forthcoming cabinet reshuffle.Cummings may also have done the PM a favour by helping expose the hypocrisy of Nicola Sturgeon. Her claims to have handled the pandemic better are now sounding distinctly hollow. She can expect a flurry of compensation claims following the admission that the Scottish Government failed to protect elderly patients in care homesIt was quite a performance. No wonder Boris Johnson practically purred at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions on the day The Dom lobbed his self-destructive hand grenades. Not so much Independence Day as the Great Escape.I felt almost sorry for the dark lord as he exposed his personality disorders in what almost became an Oprah-style confessional. Cummingsrsquos most revealing moment came right at the start when he nearly broke down while delivering an apology to those who died needlessly. He is clearly a troubled man.But he squandered it all by a display of arrogance, ignorance, pettiness, vanity, malevolence. Of unreliability and disloyalty ndash not just to Boris Johnson, who stood by him over Barnard Castle, but to the civil servants, scientists, ministers whose trust he betrayed to no good purpose.It is fine to be a whistleblower ndash provided you know how to blow it.In more competent hands Cummingsrsquos evidence, especially about Johnsonrsquos dithering over the second lockdown last autumn, might have done real damage. But his accusations either missed their target or rebounded. Not least when Cummings declared that everyone at a senior level in government was ldquocrackers ndash including himself.The main charge against Boris Johnson has always been that the PM was reckless, uncaring and throughout the pandemic, putting the interests of the economy above human lives. That he wilfully ignored scientic advice and thought we should just ldquotake it on the chin. Cummings made clear that, on the contrary, Johnsonrsquos failings were a reflection of a dysal civil service run by amateurs and by a scientic community which was fighting the wrong pandemic. It was chaos, from top to bottom. Whitehall said it had a plan but didnrsquot. The Governmentrsquos scientic advisers thought they were dealing with flu. No-one ndash Cummings included ndash advised the PM to take any serious action, such as quarantine and closing the borders, until mid-March. Even then the borders were not closed for fear it would look ldquoracist. Large gatherings like Cheltenham were allowed to continue.In hindsight, Johnsonrsquos scientic advisers should have learned from the prompt action taken by some Asian countries like South Korea that had experienced the Sars and Mers outbreaks. But the point was: they didnrsquot. Cummings underlined that international agencies ndash like the World Health Organisation and the US Centres for Disease Control ndash were also slow off the mark.Even after the pandemic was recognised as such in March , the consensus on the Scientic Advisory Group on Emergenciesand in Whitehall was that, in the absence of a vaccine, the disease had to be allowed to ldquowork its way through the population until herd immunity was achieved. The aim, as Cummings explained it, was to seek immunity by the autumn, to avoid a second wave in winter.This was all wrong, of course. Coronavirus was much more contagious and lethal than flu. But Cummings portrayed this as a collective failure that could not solely be laid at the door of the PM however ldquounfit he thought he was was for office. He even quoted the Cabinet Secretary at the time, Mark Sedwill, advocating a Covid version of ldquochickenpox parties to help spread immunity.Cummings should have pleaded the Fth because he then incriminated himself. In January and February , he did nothing. He didnrsquot even attend Cobra meetings, didnrsquot advise lockdown, didnrsquot even discuss what lockdown meant seriously until that infamous ldquoIndependence Day meeting on March  in Downing Street. That was when his whiteboard told him disaster was imminent and that the PM needed a ldquoPlan B. Unfortunately, the then-Deputy Cabinet Secretary Helen McNamara burst in saying ldquotherersquos no planndash wersquore absolutely f****d.The next day, March , Cummings still did not call on the PM to impose a full Wuhan-style lockdown. He was just ldquotoo scared that I might be wrong. Anyway, he said, SAGE ldquohad not modelled any kind of lockdown because it was still labouring under the logic of herd immunity.Yetthere was no Plan B, who might be thought to be at least partly responsible for that,not the most influential adviser in government: Dominic Cummings  He had even blogged about the dangers of coronavirus pandemics before entering government.I ended up agreeing with Boris Johnson: chaos would indeed be better than putting this monomaniac in charge of anything. Cummings even said that, given his choice, he would have put a ldquodictator in charge of the pandemic.It doesnrsquot take a genius now to forecast what the official inquiry is going to say whenever it reports. There was a systemic failure to plan going back several administrations. The scientic advisers, and Whitehall, failed to appreciate just how deadly Covid- was. The Prime Ministerrsquos advisers, from Cummings down, failed to alert him until it was too late. Lessons will be learned etc.Prime ministers are not scientists, they rely on advice from civil servants, special advisers and medical experts. Cummings even distanced Johnson from the most serious scandal of all: the deaths of some , care home residents. Cummings pinned that on Matt Hancock who, he said, lied about testing elderly patients before they were decanted from acute wards. Hancock says he didnrsquot promise anything of the sort.Nicola Sturgeon may regret jumping on the Cummings bandwagon and accusing Johnson of being responsible for ldquoloss of le. Some , old people were decanted from Scottish hospitals during the first wave, many without a test. Compensation lawyers are already sharpening their writs.As this column has pointed out before, the Scottish Government made all the same mistakes ndash it did not lock down early enough, halted community testing, neglected care homes. The Scottish excess death rate is one of the worst in Europe. Ms Sturgeon accused Johnson of failing to impose a circuit-breaker lockdown in the autumn. But she didnrsquot impose a full lockdown then either.Perhaps she now needs a Cummings figure to help spread the blame.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Therersquos a Holyrood mandate for a second referendum, facing an absolute lsquoNorsquo from Westminster. In the eyes of Scotlandrsquos most renowned historian, Sir Tom Devine, the union hasnrsquot been under such strain since the Jacobite risings were crushed.In a bid to unravel where Scotland now stands, in terms of the history of the union, the Herald on Sunday sat down with Professor Devine. Over two hours of conversation, the worldrsquos leading authority on Scottish history gave what amounts to a personal lecture for Herald on Sunday readers.BIRTH PAINSldquoLetrsquos start at the beginning, Devine says, ldquoin . The treaty was a union of partnership - thatrsquos very relevant to whatrsquos happening today.However, for the first  years ldquothere was no certainty that it would prevail in terms of a stable relationship. Aside from Jacobitism, there were two big problems: increased taxation due to Englandrsquos wars with France, and the ldquoviolation of the treaty by the Patronage Act of  which interfered with the way the church was run. Both fomented early tension and ldquohostility.Of course the main threat was ldquoJacobitism, the attempt by some elements of Scottish society to reverse the revolution of  [when the Catholic Stuart king, James II, was overthrown by Protestant William of Orange] and restore the Stuart dynasty.Although the Jacobites are remembered mostly for opposition to the Hanoverian regime, there was also, says Devine, a strong degree of ldquodisaffection from the union. Both matters were the cause of four ldquovery serious risings between  and the most famous of all .:Opinion: Throughout the pandemic Boris Johnson has had to battle with himselfMONEY, MONEY, MONEYAnti-unionism was driven mostly by economics. ldquoOne of the prime arguments made by those propagandising before the union was that it would bring bounty, says Devine. Scotland was promised ldquoan economic miracle, and after famine in the s and the financial disaster of the failed Darien expedition to establish a Scottish colony in Panama the idea of union with England ldquowas a powerful argument. You may be giving up your sovereignty but yoursquore getting economic goodies.However, the economic miracle didnrsquot happen. Scotland simply ldquodidnrsquot have the capacity to take advantage of the opportunities offered by union because the country wasnrsquot yet mature enough in material terms to exploit it.Both Jacobitism, and general dissatisfaction with the union, were partly driven by ldquoa revolution of frustrated expectations. Devine says ldquothere were Jacobite banners not simply proclaiming the Stuart dynasty but saying no to the union. There were many elements in the army of Charles Edward Stuart [Bonnie Prince Charlie] at Culloden who were not only opposed to the Hanoverians but also the union.Northeast Scotland, parts of the Highlands and islands, and parts of the southwestern border were ldquounambiguously anti-union. Anti-unionism was also ldquocommonplace in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Clearly, the Act of Union wasnrsquot agreed by the Scottish people - the event took place in a ldquopre-democratic society.Taxation, English interference in the Kirk, and the failure of the economic miracle to materialise all added to the ldquoinevitable growing pains of a union between two ancient enemies. There were three parties in parliament - the Jacobite Cavaliers, the Court party representing the establishment pushing for union, and the anti-union Country party which was out of power. There was broad parliamentary consent for the economic parts of the treaty, but dissent on most other elements. Riots broke out in Edinburgh as ldquothe street sided with anti-unionists in parliament.WAR AND SECURITYFrance - Englandrsquos great rival for world domination - saw the union ldquobolstering the power of its enemy, as it closed a backdoor to England in future wars. England, meanwhile, saw union as a national security imperative, protecting its northern border. With England emboldened militarily through partnership with Scotland, the union ldquohastened the intensity of the long wars with France until Britain emerged victorious at the end of the Napoleonic Wars in .Therersquos lesson to be learned in  from the early days of union. Scotland wasnrsquot ldquoannexed by conquest like Wales and Ireland, says Devine. ldquoIt was a partnership agreement and that partnership agreement has now been lost, and lost very recently. David Cameronrsquos granting of a referendum was an example of that partnership operating - he was quick to acknowledge the right of Scots to determine their own future, unlike his successor in Downing Street today.Devine believes thata second referendum happens ldquothe core weakness for those who wish Scottish independence will be economics, the same way economics caused dficulties in the first half of the th century.Debates today about currency, trade with England and ldquowhat kind of advantages and disadvantages would flow economically from independence ldquoecho some of the issues swirling around in the late th and early th centuries.:Poll finds only one fth of English voters oppose Scottish independenceTHE RISINGSIronically, the Jacobite risings helped secure the union. With expectations disappointed over the promised economic miracle, the threat of a successful Jacobite rebellion, which would have heralded theof Catholicism, ldquodisciplined pro unionists who were fed up with the way the union was going. Those who had a tepid commitment to the union - and given the religious make-up of Scotland theyrsquod have iniably been Protestant - were forced to group together. Those who were becoming increasingly anxious that the union wasnrsquot delivering could never have sided with those trying to break the union as that would have legitimised the forces of Catholicism. If Jacobitism didnrsquot exist, the union may have been in greater danger.That split in Scotland has echoes today. In the early s, ldquoabout a third of the population was probably anti-union. Today, Devine notes, itrsquos about -. Fear over isions, he says, will play a part in any future referendum, with unionists warning that ldquosuch a bitterly ided country is no basis for building a new nationYes won.The shaky early history of the union quickly changed, though, after the risings. By the mid th century, says Devine, ldquothe union was entirely unproblematic. How did such a sundered country unite so quickly Jacobitsim was ldquorooted out to such an extent by military and legislative means that it never recovered. By the late th century ldquoitrsquos become part of history. Jacobitism became sentimentalised in songs and Walter Scott novels. ldquoThat sentimentalisation, says Devine, ldquois the clearest example that it was beaten. If it had remained dangerous that sentimentalisation wouldnrsquot have occurred.BOOM TIMEHighland culture and power was also crushed, most famously in the Clearances. The Highland warrior was coopted into the British army, becoming a fabled part of empire after Waterloo.More importantly, though, than this pacication of the Highlands and destruction of Jacobitism was money. Scotlandrsquos ldquogreat lt off began. The country started industrialising at a remarkable rate. There was also a revolution in agriculture and mass urbanisation. ldquoThe material benefits promised by union began arriving in spades, says Devine. ldquoScotland began to feel at ease in the union.Scotlandrsquos economic revolution ldquowas the fastest and most decisive in Europe. Englandrsquos industrialisation built up over time, while in Scotland therersquod been ldquohardly any change until the mid th century when the economy exploded. ldquoThere was nothing like it in Europe until forced industrialisation in the Soviet Union, Devine said.It was this growth of wealth and industry which helped settle Scotland firmly into union. ldquoIt draws the poison of disaffection, Devine says. This accommodation with union was ldquoso complete by the s that some Scottish intellectuals feared total anglicisation, Devine explains. ldquoThere was a fear that the battle for economic development had been won at the cost of Scotlandrsquos identity.But lsquoScottishnessrsquo wasnrsquot destroyed, Devine says. Therersquos no ldquovictory of Britishness over Scottishness, rather a ldquohybrid identity of Britishness and Scottishness emerges.EMPIRE BUILDINGPatriotism remained, but Scotland was ldquothe most unnationalistic country in the world. While the great empires of Europe fell apart, Scotland ldquowas congratulating itself on being part of the British empire. The nation fully embraced the business of empire and colonialism.Another historical irony was that come the mid-th century, when Scotland was so thoroughly part of empire and union, there was almost a sense of ldquosemi-independence in terms of how the country was governed. Clearly, Westminster was sovereign, says Devine, but there was a tradition in parliament that Scottish MPs decided the ldquorelevant bills for the country - theyrsquod be put before parliament and hardly ever opposed. Scotland was also governed on a daily basis by lsquoScots in Scotlandrsquo when it came to the law, religion, education, hospitals, poor laws, and prisons.ldquoEngland was prepared to be tolerant, to stand back. There was no friction between the two countries because of Englandrsquos restraint. England refused to occupy more than its share of the marital bed.Another ldquodelicious historical irony, says Devine, is that now ldquothe situation is reverse hellipyou compare the mid-th century to Boris Johnsonrsquos union today there was arguably more Scottish control of its own business, apart from issues like macro economic policy, foreign policy and making war.ldquoAnother paradox, says Devine, is that with Scotland today ldquobeholden to England because of the Barnett formula it now experiences increased interference. The classic example is Brexit. It was the reverse of the kind of government that existed between England and Scotland in the th century because it exemplies, more than anything  in the entire history of the union, England using its weight and power to force through a decision overwhelmingly opposed by Scotland.VICTORIAN VALUESUnionism in the Victorian era was ldquobenign. The state wasnrsquot interventionist, and with no security threat from Scotland, England ldquodidnrsquot really care too much about what was going on north of the border.Against this backdrop, Scotland and England began the business of empire building as a ldquojoint partnership. Devine says: ldquoThe old aphorism is true: England ruled the empire and Scotland ran it hellip the two countries were bound in that imperial project. These bonds deepened in the th centuryrsquos two world wars which ldquobound the countries together in blood.The period throughout most of the th century until the collapse of the British empire after the Second World War was the high point of union, when ideas of SNP nationalism belonged to a ldquofringe sect.The end of empire signalled that ldquoBritain was no longer great, and was followed by a ldquoseries of economic catastrophes like the crises of the s which paved the way for Margaret Thatcher, and policies which ldquoalienated Scotland.Scotlandrsquos iconic industries collapsed - coal, steel, shipbuilding. For Scotland, trade with the empire was replaced by trade with England. Devine says hersquos more skeptical than most historians about linking the end of empire to the growth of nationalism - symbolised by Winnie Ewingrsquos  Hamilton by-election win - but the events of the latter half of the th century certainly created a sense ldquoof introspection in Scotland, the sense that a more ldquoScottish centred future was needed, fuelled in part by concerns over the increasing importance, and dominance, of the economic relationship with England.SNP ASCENDANTHowever, the rise of the SNP still ldquowasnrsquot inevitable. Things changed when Tony Blairrsquos Labour administration created the Scottish parliament. The idea that rather than ldquokilling off nationalism, Labour actually built its own gallows in Scotland through devolution is ldquovery pertinent, says Devine.At the same time, identity politics was on the rise and many were growing disenchanted with globalisation. ldquoThatrsquos a very important factor stoking nationalism, says Devine. People were becoming uneasy with the power of the large state. ldquoThey wanted more control, he says. This also played into growing criticism of the EU culminating in England quitting Europe.More importantly, though, was ldquothe apparent inability of successive British governments to cure Scotlandrsquos economic problems. Another irony, however, is that while economic discontent ran alongside the growth in nationalism, once the painful transformation of the s and s was over, Scotlandrsquos economy today has emerged in better shape than itrsquos been for a long time, says Devine.Once the SNP won its  majority, the path was laid for a referendum. Devine says the fact that support for Yes hasnrsquot disintegrated is crucial. ldquoIf there was another referendum the chances of Yes winning are now much greater.TORY DISRESPECTHowever, the other crucial factor is that the Tory Party today is ldquounlike any British government since the early th century. After breaking Labourrsquos Red Wall, itrsquos almost ldquohegemonic.Therersquos been a ldquoshattering effect on many Scots who ldquodidnrsquot want to leave their friends behind in Tory dominated Englandthey went down the independence road, says Devine. With the Tories seemingly unassailable ldquothatrsquos now changed.The most important historic change of all, though, is the attitude of the Tories in government. ldquoSince the early th century therersquos been no instance of such a brazen refusal to accept Scottish opinion as Brexit. Judged in the long history of the union, this is an extraordinary volte face. The word lsquodisrespectrsquo isnrsquot strong enough.Devine added: ldquoWhatrsquos preserved the union has been good management by England - as the dominant party. It was a policy of respect and restraint by the big elephant in the bed. Scotland is now in danger of getting pushed out of bed. The future is not my period, butindependence does come then the killer of union will be more England not Scotland, because of the abandonment of that system of restraint, partnership and respect.He added: ldquoThe governing party in England is a dferent Tory party to even the Thatcher years. Itrsquos much more right-wing. Something has happened which never existed until after : the rapid growth of English nationalism. He points to polls showing a majority of Tories happy to see the union crumble to save Brexit.ldquoThe Conservative party, which was the classic defender of union throughout its existence, can no longer be trusted to preserve the union because of the growth of this Little Englandism. Many of its supporters see Scotland as an ungrateful liability as they assume theyrsquore giving privileges out of their taxes to the Scottish people.ldquoThe union is undeniably in more jeopardy than it has ever been since the end of the th century. The vice the union is caught up in threatens to crush it - on the one hand therersquos the old enemy of Scottish nationalism, on the other therersquos the new enemy of English nationalism.THE FUTURERegardless of Tory mistreatment, the independence case is far from won. Devine says the SNPrsquos ldquoAchilles Heel is its failure to make a convincing economic argument. ldquoThe majority of sensible Scots are waiting to seethe SNP has real economic plans. They need to be totally honest with the electorate. Without the economic case being made itrsquos impossible to say whether ldquothe hammer of blow of Brexit and other aspects of UK government policy would lead to a Yes win.ldquoPeople accept the first few years of a post-union Scotland could be tough, but they may be willing to give the benefit of the doubt and vote for independencetheyrsquore told clearly and honestly what the challenges may be. If the SNP was willing to do that theyrsquod gain respect, Devine says.Devine believes any violence linked to the constitution is currently ldquomost unlikely. The SNP is law-abiding. ldquoScotland isnrsquot Catalonia. However, itrsquos ldquomore dficult to predict what might happen hellip from any extreme [unionist] elementsYes won. Even then it would be ldquosmall scale hellip hooliganism not a real ldquopolitical threat.Given the changed political landscape in England, Devine worries that any future negotiations - over the shape of a second referendum or the terms of separation - ldquowouldnrsquot be benign. London would undoubtedly play hardball. Any negotiations would be pretty brutal.He adds: ldquoIf Yes had won in  negotiations would have been relatively friendly as it was in the interests of both nations. I donrsquot think the English people at the moment are in the mood for that - and the Tory supporting majority certainly arenrsquot."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-glasgow-installs-new-seating-decking-help-boost-spaces-people","story":"As part of the Spaces for All programme, introduced last year in a response helping to make the city more covid safe, these are the latest measures which have been installed in St Vincent Place.Glasgow City Council introduced a iety of changes on roads and footways across the city through the Scottish Governments Spaces for People Programme, which aimed to support public health by providing additional space for physical distancing while undertaking essential journeys or exercise during the pandemic.Read more: Covid memorial: How I Remember theme can reach out to help culture of recuperationNow a city-wide survey is under way with residents and business being asked what measures they would like to see made permanent.

Politics is obviously important to her and shersquos proven to be very good at it but theyrsquoll never be central to what she considers to be her primary mission in le. She wasnrsquot preachy and nor was she seeking to convert anyone. She just wanted to be clear with people where she stood with them and where they stood with her.Not long ago, Ms Forbesrsquo words wouldnrsquot have elicited much comment. This was, after all, an unremarkable distillation of whatrsquos fundamental to all of Scotlandrsquos Christian denominations. What elevated her words from the mundane to the profound arenrsquot the truths she attaches to them but those that attach to the world in which she operates.They moved against the grain of whatrsquos currently considered essential in the cultural philosophy of the political and media classes. In this, adherence to beliefs handed on, unchanged through generations must be assumed to be problematic. As such they could have severely damaged her career, and may yet still do so. Ms Forbes represents a party where several others have been persecuted for daring to follow the tenets of their faith against the wishes of the secular inquisition.Read more:Dominic Cummingsrsquo testimony shows Tory dregs have risen to topBy all accounts though, the Finance Minister is admired across Holyroodrsquos political and cultural spectrum. ldquoThere is no artice about her, I was told last week. ldquoShe treats people kindly and people always respond well to that. In passing judgment on her world ndash ldquopolitics will pass ndash she removed the potential of that world to damage her.

For, they occurred in a month when it seemed that nothing that emerges from the mouths of politicians has ever been less trusted.There was an initial release of endorphins last week following Dominic Cummings sworn testimony about the UK Governmentrsquos early handling of coronavirus. It was quickly followed though, by the familiar torpor that comes with knowing therersquoll be no consequences and that wersquoll never get to the truth thousands died needlessly. Asto underscore the fact an opinion poll indicated an increase in the Toriesrsquo numbers.Perhaps, having become so desensitised to the universal finagling and dodging of the political classes, our expectations of truth and transparency are diminished now. Perhaps we no longer rate these as necessary virtues of high office because we want to spare ourselves the pain of disappointment.And do politicians, their political antennae ining this sht in the public consciousness, now simply factor it in to their modelling  ldquoLook, we say wersquore transparent and accountable, but we know wersquove battered you with so many lies that you donrsquot believe it any more than we do.Previously, there had always been an assumption of truth within which we granted some degree of flexibility. All that we asked is that they didnrsquot take us for fools.

I got into a discussion with a colleague about something or other when he referred to me as ldquoProtestant. Really  Was I  Was I ldquoProtestant  I realised even at the time that Protestantism is about more than religion, but I am the son of two atheists and Irsquom not religious and I never went to church. Basically, it had never occurred to me that I was Protestant and Irsquod never once referred to myself, or thought of myself, that way.:SNP in turmoil after Indy taskforce chief quits worst job ever and malcontent treasurer resignsAndyet, as far as my colleague, and others, was concerned, I was ldquoProtestant ndash something I said, or did, had given me away ndash and, whatrsquos more, my colleague was annoyed with me for not behaving like one. He found out that friends of mine had invited me to a football game and that Irsquod gone, sitting with them in the Celtic end. As far as the colleague was concerned, this was bewildering and treacherous. I told him I would happily come and sit with him for a Rangers game too. But no. The damage was done.I realise part of the problem here is that I was a naiumlve young man coming from a city where religious sectarianism pretty much didnrsquot matter to a city where it mattered a lot. But even so, it struck me at the time that you do not always know how yoursquore seen, and that you can be walking around for a long time without noticing the labels on you. Itrsquos like that game people play at parties, the one where you stick a piece of paper on your forehead and try to guess what it says: other people can read it, but you canrsquot.The sad thing is I think a similar trend has been emerging more recently in a related but dferent way. Until  or so, I would never have considered myself ldquounionist. Part of the reason for that was the SNP were nowhere politically and the constitution, although it was discussed, was not a pressing issue. Also, most of us had not been forced to take sides and werenrsquot really thinking about the labels that might be stuck to us.The referendum in  changed that and, more rapidly and violently that I would have expected, we started to attach the labels ldquounionist or ldquonationalist to each other. It applied all over Scotland and in certain places, like Glasgow, ldquounionist and ldquoprotestant were conflated. Of course, the rule is not universal ndash I have friends from a Catholic background who voted No and friends from a Protestant background who voted Yes ndash but the point is: the labels were there and there was only a choice of two: Yes or No. Choose your side  Right, thatrsquos it: yoursquore a unionist or youre a nationalist.Some of you may think all of this is a bit rich coming from me and that Irsquom part of the problem with my ldquounionist columns and certainly I think we are now prone to look at every issue through Yes and No telescopes. Take the recent meeting between Gordon Brown and Prince William for example. Yoursquore likely to make a judgement about it depending on whether yoursquore a ldquounionist or a ldquonationalist. Perhaps you see it as the latest attempt to hold back the worrying rise of the SNP perhaps you see it as royals plotting with unionists. Check the label on your forehead for the answer.The recent argument over the statue of William III in Glasgow is also interesting in this respect. The statue has been vandalised a few times and in the most recent incident the horsersquos tail was broken off. In a statement, the Orange Order said it was yet another anti-Protestant attack and that all things Protestant and Unionist were being demonised in Scotland. ldquoWith recent rhetoric by the usual political rent a quotes and the accompanying media frenzy, it said, ldquoGrand Lodge is hardly surprised that such mindless actions have happened.:Independence: Does Sturgeon have the guts to make changes in the SNP, evenit means telling her husband that itrsquos time to move on The reaction of the Order goes back a long, long way ndash which is part of the problem ndash but my worry is their binary outlook is no longer as unusual as it once was. The Orange Order see the world as unionist and non-unionist and, instead of that approach fading into the past ndash as we might expect and hope ndash there are more Scots who now see the world this way, with or without the added ision of Catholic and Protestant. In other words, evenyou reject the idea of the \"Ulsterisation\" of Scotland - and Scotland and Northern Ireland are dferent places, of course they are -the idea of a society ided into two camps is now much more familiar to Scots than it would have been  years ago.The fact that wersquove seen this happen over the last few years is utterly depressing to me. Perhaps it is a perverse comfort to some that the isions that exist in Scotland are not unique and that politics is more ided along identity lines around the world . And, in some ways, Scotland has become a more erse and more tolerant place.However, in other ways,were being honest, Scotland has become distinctly less tolerant, particularlyyou belong to the ldquoother camp and the label on your forehead says the wrong thing. And my worry is that, now we think in these terms, the labels will never disappear. As long as Scotland remains in the UK, we are all either unionist or nationalist, and evenwe do become independent, the resentments associated with the labels are unlikely to go away. Because labels stick.All we can do, I suppose, is try to resist as much as we can. In the years that Irsquove been writing this column, Irsquove been called pretty much everything: unionist, Tory, right-wing, ldquowoke, SNP hater, SNP spy, and someone even speculated about whether I used to be a member of the Socialist Workersrsquo Party . The point is some of the labels are laughable and some are just wrong but none of them is entirely accurate because simplistic labels rarely reflect the details of who we are and what we think. I do not want to be a label. I do not want to be this or that. I do not want to be a unionist any more.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

but there was a slight delay.The Australian scientist who was the only person who could understand the scientic modelling to track the meteorite was enjoying a local bank holiday windsurfing.But finally they had their location in the Cotswolds and a team of around  scientists set off to scour fields for small pieces of rock.A television appeal led to one family realising a charcoal coloured splatter on their driveway had travelled across the solar system to crash land outside their house.But the team knew there were more pieces to be uncovered.Aine said: \"It felt like a movie of the fireball alliance - all these dferent networks coming together, combining their data.\"There were five fragments in total. Four were found by members of the public on their own land after seeing people like Luke on the news saying looking out for a bit of black rock.\"The first piece was the piece on the driveway that got splatted and even made a little dent, which is amazing, a tiny little crater about five centimetres deep.\"We spent five or six days going up and down fields and knocking on doors and very politely asking a lot of very posh people - because its very wealthy in the Gloucestershire countryside - you may have seen on the news theres been a fireball, youve got a lovely big field, wed like to search it.\"Meteorites are shiny black rocks and just look like poo. We spent all week thinking we had found it and then it turning out to be just poo - sheep poo, rabbit poo, deer poo, all the British animals have meteorite-sized poo.\"So we spent a lot of time on meteor-wrongs.\"Mira, originally from Hungary, was quietly confident she would be the one to spot the meteor-right. Before setting out on the search her mum had told her she felt she would be successfu.She said: \"I was hoping they didnt find it so that on the day I arrived, the Saturday, we could find it together.\"We went out to a field full of sheep poos. I really felt after an hour so embarrassed not being a scientist and not knowing what is a meteorite because it is completely dferent from being in a museum with the spotlight where it glitters.\"I was focusing so hard, going everywhere, turning over every single blade of glass.\"Mira started to feel embarrassed, as the only non-scientist, to be constantly asking the others to double-check what she had spotted.But then she struck lucky.She said: \"I was behind everyone and I was telling myself to catch up with the others but I saw something and I wasnt sure.\"When Luke arrived and said This is it I had a complete blackout. I was not believing him. Youre asking a scientist Are you sure this is what you are studying for  years \"Everybody was just celebrating and jumping. It was such a moment. I think when you win the Lottery you are probably not as enthusiastic.\"My heart was beating like crazy. I could not believe it. It was once in a letime.\"And once you see it you realise it is nothing like a poo really.\"One of the residents who had seen the search left the team a bottle of whisky and glasses to celebrate, a much appreciated gesture given hugs and high fives were off the cards for covid reasons.The law states that rocks belong to the land owner but, fortunately, five were donated to the Natural History Museum and work immediately began to study to the meteorite and find out what answers it might give to some of les huge questions.The rock is one of the rarest - a carbonaceous chondrite, an ancient structure holding the building blocks of planets.Pieces of it are now being sold on the black market for thousands of pounds but for the scientists, it is priceless.Fortunately, following its journey across the solar system, the section of rock found by Mira landed in mud, which helped to protect it.Aine has been studying the rock. She said: \"The pieces I get are half a gram, so tiny little chips at a time. I have to put them in to a little pestle and mortar.\"I am quite a clumsy person and this is ultra precious rock so when Im in the lab it is so so scary - you breath and this stuff is basically dust.\"Winchcombe is an incredible find because, unlike the other , meteorites worldwide, it is possible to trace its parent asteroid and know where it came from.It formed before there were planets in our solar system and contains the dust and gas from when there was only the sun and a disc around it.Luke said: \"NASA and the Japanese space agency have spent billions of dollars sending probes to asteroids to bring back g from water rich asteroids and we got g in a field.\"All the minerals inside it were formed in the first few millions years of our solar systems history, basically its got all the building blocks you would ever want to seed a planet to jump start the origin of le.\"Studying meteorites like Winchombe, the fact we got it so fast means theres going to be stuff we dont usually see in other meteorites of this type, which is really exciting.\"So were just talking about small questions like origin of the solar system, origin of water, origin of le - just the trivial stuff in this wee little rock that Mira found in a field hopefully will bring us some answers.\"Aine says the meteorites discovery feels like a mirror to the pandemic, a global scientic effort that needed the support of ordinary people.During lockdown, residents might have been hostile to having visitors arrive from other parts of the UK but the team was welcomed.She said: \"People in France had cameras, people in Holland had cameras, people in Australia were doing the maths. Its similar to what the covid effort is.\"When people donated the meteorite one of the things they said was, We want to do this because were so grateful to what scientists have achieved and given to us with developing the vaccine.\"They were just so grateful, this couple, for everything scientists had done.\"It just feels like this really special thing, this lockdown meteorite. Socially, culturally, the fact it was a citizen science effort and people got excited about it in a way they might not have before the pandemic.\"It felt like a bit of a cultural phenomenon.\"A piece of the Winchcombe meteorite is now on display in the Natural History Museum and will be displayed in the Hunterian Museum at Glasgow University."},{"url":null,"title":"nsa-report-claims-denmark-helped-us-gather-data-european-officials","story":"Reports in theDanish media claims that intelligence was collected from The Defence Intelligence Service on other officials from Germany, France, Sweden and Norway.In a new report shared with several European news agencies,the NSA is said to have accessed text messages and the phone conversationsof a number of prominent iniduals by tapping into Danish internet cables in cooperation with the FE.It is the second time such allegations have surfaced, with similar allegations made in  following leaks from Edward Snowden.A report, seen by media outlets on the continent, \"Operation Dunhammer\", allowed the NSA to obtain data using the telephone numbers of politicians as search parameters.In Germany, it is thought that Angela Merkel,then-German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and opposition leader at the time Peer Steinbruck were targetted.Biden is well-prepared to answer for this when he soon visits Europe since, of course, he was deeply involved in this scandal the first time around.There should be an explicit requirement for full public disclosure not only from Denmark, but their senior partner as well. https:t.co TJLgrdyDenmarks Defence Minister Trine Bramsen, who had reportedly been earlier informed of the espionage, told Danmarks Radio that \"systematic wiretapping of close allies is unacceptable\".After the news surfaced, Snowden,a former contractor for the US Central Intelligence Agency, tweeted: \"Biden is well-prepared to answer for this when he soon visits Europe since, of course, he was deeply involved in this scandal the first time around.

The brutal treatment of Floyd, the subsequent anti-racism protests and the storming of the US Capitol by Trump supporters, also inspired her to write a new song, What About Us , after she learned to play guitar during lockdown.Rachel, who had just started on Broadway in the multi-award-winning musical Come From Away when the pandemic hit in March , has released a new EP titled Lessons containing the original track and a second self-composition, The View, about the pressures of social media.She said: “Locked up at home in London, I was seeing all these things happening in the news and just couldn’t ignore them.“The murder of George Floyd and that horrendous nine-minute footage of the police officer kneeling on his neck seriously made me sick to the stomach. I didn’t feel like talking for days. I didn’t go onto social media or celebrate my birthday.“What we witnessed meant we couldn’t avoid it it was there for the whole world to see, and it forced us to stand up and take account of how this was happening to mainly young black men.“Floyd’s murder was a turning point for me. I couldn’t be a bystander anymore.Since then I’ve refused to let racist comments go by the way I might’ve done in the past. It’s a hard conversation to have with someone, to tell them: ‘Can you please not say that ’“No one wants to be that person who’s pulling people up, but I really believe that we’re all partaking in racismwe don’t stand up and say ‘stop’ and call people out.“It doesn’t have to be done in a way that starts a fight, but instead in a way that encourages conversations and makes people more aware of what they’re saying.”Rachel said she had always wanted to learn to play the guitar so when Come From Away was postponed after  shows and she had to fly back to the UK, she used the free time to begin twice weekly Zoom lessons.Her teacher was Dan Giles, her musical director and collaborator, and together they worked on several new songs.When the material was finished Rachel and Dan recorded the tracks in a converted shed using hung-up duvets to soak up the sound. They then headed into a studio in Guildford with a socially distanced four-piece band to record the EP. Lessons also features several covers — The Beatles’ Blackbird, Nick Cave’s The Ship Song and In The Arms Of An Angel by Sarah McLachlan.“I really enjoyed the writing process and learning to play the guitar,” said Rachel.“I was very fortunate to have a creative outlet over lockdown when so many people in the arts were out of work.“Of course it was disappointing that Come From Away was pulled after only  shows, but I think it would have been much more devastatingI’d had to stop for personal reasons. As it was, the whole world was in the same position.”Rachel, who also starred in the West End and Broadway productions of Wicked, is expecting toto New York in September for the reopening of Come From Away.The Canadian musical is set in the week following the September  attacks and tells the true story of what happened when  planes were ordered to land unexpectedly in the small Canadian town of Gander. Rachel picked up an Olivier nod for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical for the role.However, with theatres closed for almost a year-and-a-half, Rachel auditioned for straight drama roles in television, securing a guest slot in Holby City and a part in new BBC series Hope Street, currently being filmed in Northern Ireland.It’s her first time acting in a TV show back home and she’s loving it.

Credit: Stephen HamiltonLauren HarteTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAn intrepid Co Down man received a hero’s welcome on Monday night as he reached the finish line after running a marathon-a-day for the full month of May.Joshua Eastwoodfrom Donaghadee, the grandson of late famous bookmaker and boxing promoter Barney Eastwood, took on the punishing challenge to raise funds for two local charities.When he set off from his home on May  to start the first of his  runs, it was the first time the keen golfer and self-confessed “non-runner” had completed a marathon.In the end he covered a whopping , kilometres after embarking on the monumental challenge. The mechanical engineer only started running last year when he joined a friend who was taking part in an event for the men’s health charity Movember.It gave him the idea to take on a challenge of his own, so in preparation he kept running, and has ran every day since.Joshua set himself a target of raising £ for every kilometre.Even before he hit the tarmac on the first day he had already smashed that target on his GoFundMe page, and hopes that people will continue to donate and support him. By last night the total stood at over £,.But whatever the final sum, Joshua plans to share it equally between the Northern Ireland Children to Lapland and Days to Remember Trust and Cancer Research UK.He said he had been touched by the generosity of supporters and well-wishers, who share his passion for his nominated charities and recognise the pressure that the pandemic has placed on these organisations.“It’s been a tough year for many people for many dferent reasons and I hope that this may inspire others,” Joshua added. “If I can do something so far out of my comfort zone, then maybe so can they.“When the elements have been against me and my body has been hurting from the injuries during this challenge, it’s the thought of the children that kept me going.Nothing compares to what they may be going through.” Joshua had three routes to follow: one around his home town and two others which took him to Bangor. He set off around am each day and paced himself to try and avoid too much pain, finishing each race in under five hours. Throughout his challenge proud mum Gail has been busy cooking, as Joshua needed to consume , calories a day.While Denis Waterworth, who owns the restaurants Pier  and The Harbour, provided him with a steak meal every Sunday.Famous faces have been actively supporting Joshua, including boxing hero Carl Frampton, who completed part of the endeavour with Joshua, and former Ulster and Ireland Rugby stars Tommy Bowe and Chris Henry, who ran k with Joshua on two occasions.He was joined on Sunday by Northern Ireland women’s football captain Marissa Callaghan. Other high-profile supporters included Lady Mary Peters, Eddie Izzard, Willie John McBride and Nathan Carter.If you would like to donate, go to Joshua’s Go Fund Me page: https:www.gofundme f amarathoneverydayinmay.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolEdwin Poots braced for a raft of resignations as DUP implodesIRA man who killed Captain Robert Nairac was yards from Prince Charles during recent NI visitPortstewart fire on Bank Holiday Monday damages business premisesWatch: Police vehicle involved in serious collision in east BelfastTop VideosPlayPolice car involved in east Belfast RTCPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#Latest Northern IrelandBeachgoers soak up the Bank Holiday sun‘Detrimental impact’ of austerity on education exposed by Covid- – studyWatch: Police vehicle involved in serious collision in east BelfastThousands flock to pubs and restaurants over bank holiday weekendThe pursuit of happiness…  it’s all smiles in Orchard countyLatestFive charged over murder of Lincoln manJames Corden on when Carpool Karaoke could What the papers say – June Share Covid jabs with poorer nations to end iants threat, world leaders urgedJohn Barrowman thanks fans for support following flashing controversy,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo by Peter MorrisonMark BainTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMost of the time you can just tell there is a smile lurking behind the mask.It’s the eyes. The small creases at the corners, the twinkle, the gentle nod of the head.In Armagh you will spot those twinkling eyes sparkle around every corner, in every shop. A laugh isn’t too far away either. Andit’s not your home town don’t worry. The smiles are there for everyone. And before you know it the conversational greeting has developed into stories, the time of day passes amicably and step out of a shop feeling just a little better, a little more valued than you did a few minutes before.That might be the secret why, in the Orchard county of Armagh, you will find the happiest people on the island of Ireland. The Dixieland strains of Louise Armstrong could follow you around the narrow streets of the city centre that’s no bigger than a town. When you’re smiling, the whole world smiles with you... happiness spreads, and nothing makes the people of Armagh happier than spreading happiness.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Church of Ireland Cathedral.

Photo by Peter MorrisonIt may, of course, be put down to the relaxation of Covid restrictions that happiness abounds. The cafés are full, the shops are open, the people have emerged from a winter of hibernation, but there’s a spring in the steps along the streets.But it is more than that.“If you’re not from Armagh we’ll just ask you where you’re from,” said Dorothy Arnold, who runs The Flower Bowl. It’s a hard shop not to be happy in, all bright colours and wonderful smells. And before you know it, you’re lost in conversation.“We only get one chance to make an impression in le, so we might at least try to make it a good one,” she said.“I’ve been here for decades. Armagh is a lovely place to work. It’s a county where the garden is never the same. We’re surrounded by an ever changing countryside, depending on the season. It keeps everything fresh and feeling new.”She chats on about the joy of intimate weddings she has been involved with, the sadness of funerals where her flowers replaced the hugs families longed for. Even that brings a smile.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseHans Cousins selling fish in the city centre.

Photo by Peter Morrison“We love talking to people,” she said. “That’s the nature of this place. Everyone’s a friend. Walk down the street and you’ll see. You’ll get hellos from people you’ve never seen before.”And she’s right. Standing outside the town hall, fishmonger Hans Cousins is in town with his weekly catch from the Irish Sea. Several customers walk up to his van and each one of them is quickly engaged in laughter.“I’ve been coming here for over  years and this is by far the easiest part of the job,” he said. “There’s never a bother. We’re removed from city le. Everything is a slower pace.”Then we’re off talking again, with tales of his own boat, the issues over fishing times, the over zealous nature of parking attendants before being pointed in the direction of TG Hawthorne, one of the longest established businesses in Armagh.“Geoff always has a smile,” said Hans.He was right, and we’re off again with the stories starting to roll from the tongue.

The shop has grown with the town, we chat to everyone who comes inthey want a conversation and maybe that makes the smallest dference to their day.“You should go and see Joanne in her pub. She always has a smile...”The trail continues. The Hole In The Wall, Joanne Shilliday tells us, is so-called as it used to be the town jail, and taking pity people would pass food through a hole to those inside. Now a pub, the building has stood since . She delights in telling the stories of days gone by.“It’s the rule to wave at strangers,” she said, turning back to the reason for calling.“If you live here you can walk down the street and always see people you know. Go away from the town centre and you have countryside, fresh air, a reasonably stress free le.

Enough to make anyone miserable, you’d think. Not Barry. He greets with a wave and a smile. Shoppers pass and not a single one goes by without that same treatment.“I’ve got a word for everyone!” he waves and shouts across the car park.He brings out his co-worker, David McCoy.“I’ve been very happy here,” said David, who has Down’s Syndrome. Clearly the joie de vivre has rubbed off.“I just like greeting people and making them welcome,” he added.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBarry Loughran is all smiles welcoming people to the shopping centre.

He stops briefly, pulls a face at a small child in a pram to giggles.“I don’t knowit’s the fresh air, that homes are cheaper to buy, that we’re living in a small, close knit town and have rolling fields around us, but I don’t feel stressed,” said Joanne on the way back to The Hole in the Wall.Happiness amongst the people of Armagh radiates out from the commercial centre into the surrounding countryside where a peaceful lestyle can be found, away from the city centre masses and impersonal suburbs. It finds a way back in the smiles of those who come to town.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe people in Armagh are some of the happiest in Northern Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe people in Armagh are some of the happiest in Northern IrelandHappiness is contagious and Co Armagh folk, it seems, have caught it more than anywhere  in Ireland..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolEdwin Poots braced for a raft of resignations as DUP implodesIRA man who killed Captain Robert Nairac was yards from Prince Charles during recent NI visitPortstewart fire on Bank Holiday Monday damages business premisesWatch: Police vehicle involved in serious collision in east BelfastTop VideosPlayPolice car involved in east Belfast RTCPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#Latest Northern IrelandSmiles follow the miles as Joshua racks up marathon a day in MayBeachgoers soak up the Bank Holiday sun‘Detrimental impact’ of austerity on education exposed by Covid- – studyWatch: Police vehicle involved in serious collision in east BelfastThousands flock to pubs and restaurants over bank holiday weekendLatestJames Corden on when Carpool Karaoke could What the papers say – June Share Covid jabs with poorer nations to end iants threat, world leaders urgedJohn Barrowman thanks fans for support following flashing controversySturgeon to confirmfurther easing of Covid restrictions can take place,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Rebecca Black PA WireRodney EdwardsTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNew Democratic Unionist Partyleader Edwin Poots is facing a string of resignations as Northern Ireland’s largest party continues to implode.It is understood a number of DUP members, including elected representatives, will quit the party this week as the fallout over the ousting of former leader Arlene Foster intensies. “I will be resigning this week and there will be others too,” said one elected representative.Read MoreCops probe ‘text threat’ to DUP man whose brother was UDA victim     Andrew Madden and Gareth Cross:OpinionThe weekly political spin: Popcorn at the ready, DUP ision and SDLP Skywalker It comes as the Police Service of Northern Irelandinvestigates allegations the Ulster Defence Association , an illegal loyalist group, issued sinister threats to a leadership contender’s campaign team in a bid to thwart the result.Jeffrey Donaldson, a Lagan Valley MP, made the claim as Mr Poots was being ratied as leader during a “fractious”, private DUP meeting in Belfast last week.One party member who was in attendance accepted there can be “legitimate lobbying” by loyalists, “but what Jeffrey was referring to was not ambiguous in any way”. It’s understood the basis of some of the complaints revolve around “intimidating and threatening” messages sent to senior members of the DUP who are close to Mr Donaldson.According to sources, the words “you’re next” were among the alleged threats directed at members of Donaldson’s team, while other exchanges were made on the phone and email.A PSNI spokeswoman said: “Police have received a complaint that a number of members of a political party had been threatened during a recent leadership campaign.”The Sunday Independent previously reported how the UDA’s “shadowy figures” had deployed bully-boy tactics by threatening DUP members to sign a letter of no confidence in Ms Foster.It was claimed that several loyalists helped to enlist support by “reminding” some MLAs thatthey did not sign the motion, their seats at next year’s Assembly election would be in jeopardy.During Mr Poots’ acceptance speech several prominent DUP members, including Mr Donaldson and Diane Dodds left the meeting on Thursday night.In a further twist, Ms Foster’s close friend and colleague in her Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, Paul Bell, dramatically resigned from the party after Mr Poots’ ratication.Mr Bell warned the DUP will lose “thousands of votes” over the recent course of events.“We cannot go round the doors, the people in Fermanagh and South Tyrone will vote for anyone but the DUP. That is because, not of an election, but because of what took place before the election,” he said.A party ided, a police probe and several resignations within the next week are not the only issues Poots must deal with.His choice of first minister and how he responds to outstanding issues such as the implementation of Irish language legislation and the Northern Ireland protocol will be watched closely by Sinn Féin, his partners in government.Read MoreGail Walker:OpinionWhy Poots’ and Paisley’s Back to the Future strategy casts a shadow over not just the DUP but the Union“It’s important to remember the majority of parties and ministers in the Executive do not support his position,” a Sinn Féin source said.The source said the party has not ruled out refusing to nominate a deputy first minister after Poots’ proposes Ms Foster’s replacement, who is believed to be former communities minister Paul Givan.He is partly blamed for the collapse of the devolved institutions four years ago, when he and his officials cut funding for an Irish language initiative and forced an early election.“I am hearing September mooted for a potential election,” said another source.In Dublin, Mr Poots’ first few weeks will be watched closely by Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who is expected to speak to the DUP leader about the contentious issue of the protocol.Speaking after his election as leader, Mr Poots claimed relationships between Belfast and Dublin “are really, really bad”.Meanwhile, the British-Irish Council will take place in Co Fermanagh next month, where Mr Martin, along with the UK government’s Michael Gove and Scotland’s Nicola Sturgeon, will meet with leaders from Wales, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Northern Ireland.However, who will be leading Stormont remains to be seen as Ms Foster, who is still first minister, has threatened to quit this Tuesday — weeks earlier than planned —Mr Poots names her successor..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolEdwin Poots braced for a raft of resignations as DUP implodesIRA man who killed Captain Robert Nairac was yards from Prince Charles during recent NI visitPortstewart fire on Bank Holiday Monday damages business premisesWatch: Police vehicle involved in serious collision in east BelfastTop VideosPlayPolice car involved in east Belfast RTCPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#Latest PoliticsUUP leader Doug Beattie warns DUP and Sinn Fein against collapsing StormontUlster Unionists more appealing than DUP, claims young loyalist who warned of possible violence over NI Protocol Brexit: Edwin Poots says no to Swiss-style deal on trade over Irish SeaBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorLatestFive charged over murder of Lincoln manJames Corden on when Carpool Karaoke could What the papers say – June Share Covid jabs with poorer nations to end iants threat, world leaders urgedJohn Barrowman thanks fans for support following flashing controversy,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueArlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill at the Strand Arts Centre.May   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFrom the DUP in turmoil to MLAs needing Yoda#s wisdom, Andrew Madden and Gareth Cross take a closer look at some of the more unusual things in the Assembly and further afield this week.Monday: Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster forgot her worries on Monday, with a trip to the cinema in east Belfast with deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill.The pair were snapped with large boxes of popcorn as they joined pensioners at the Strand Arts Centre, as coronavirus restrictions lted, for a showing of classic short films.During the visit Mrs Foster questioned the existence of a letter of no-confidence against her signed by DUP MLAs and MPs that led to her downfall. It#s now been nearly four weeks since I heard about it and I still haven#t seen it, she said.In the Assembly, Justice Minister Naomi Long told MLAs she saw no substantive reason for a judge-led review into the Bobby Storey funeral. Ms O#Neill said it was time to get on with rebuilding our economy rather than continuing to focus on the funeral of the former IRA member.New UUP leader Doug Beattie said issues around the funeral could affect the future of Stormont itselfnot addressed, warning of terminal decline”.A busy week for Edwin Poots began with him answering a question from Jim Allister about compensation for slaughtered animals. Mr Poots, in his written answer, revealed that in   his department paid £,, in compensation for animals slaughtered for disease control purposes. Of this, £,, related to bovine Tuberculosis £, related to avian influenza and £, for Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis.Tuesday: The Assembly debated Finance Minister Conor Murphy#s budget with MLAs highly critical.Finance Committee chair Steve Aiken said it was hard to scrutinise the budget given its limited granularity, occasional evasions and obfuscations from departments.SDLP MLA Matthew O#Toole criticised NHS waiting lists, saying we should be ashamed and the budget contained no plans to address his concerns.The DUP#s Paul Frew responded, saying it was refreshing to hear Luke Skywalker in the corner, although he did sound more like Chewbacca at times, he looks to a truth that we all need the wisdom of Yoda in times of stress like this”.Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon was also critical of new DUP leader#s Edwin Poots# refusal to attend meetings of north-south bodies saying it was hugely frustrating the meetings had been deliberately obstructed.TUV leader Jim Allister said he hoped Mr Poots would refuse to engage until the Northern Ireland Protocol was dismantled, saying it had trashed east-west relations. Later the new DUP leader said he remained committed to all his obligations, but north-south relations had never been worse.Arlene Foster continued to throw herself into events to forget her troubles during her final days as First Minister.During a visit to Brooklands Primary School in Dundonald she said: “Regardless of what’s happening where, a visit to a school never fails to lt my spirits. Meeting young people is always a humbling, but invigorating experience.Wednesday: Unionists were sacriced for the Northern Ireland Protocol, Westminster#s NI Affairs Committee heard.PUP Belfast councillor Dr John Kyle said nationalists and unionists had not been treated equally during the Brexit process.The identity and ethos of the unionist community, as equal citizens with everyone  in the United Kingdom, was sacriced, he said.Dr Kyle did accept the protocol may have some economic benefits, but added for many unionists being British is more important than being prosperous.In the Assembly the Education Committee heard evidence from the General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland .Chair Brendan Morgan revealed that in nine months’ time organisations in Northern Ireland would no longer have access to the EU safeguarding database which is used to for background checks on applicants as a result of Brexit.“Is Brexit is actually exposing our children to potential risk , Sinn Fein#s Pat Sheehan asked.“As of September , we will no longer have access to that database which screens professional teachers,” Mr Morgan explained.Thursday: What was supposed to be a formal ratication process for his leadership of the DUP turned into a nightmare for Edwin Poots.As new UUP leader Doug Beattie contentedly sipped a whiskey after being unanimously elected to lead his party, a DUP rubber stamping exercise laid the party#s isions bare for the world to see.While an attempt to hold a secret ballot to confirm Mr Poots# leadership was rejected, senior party figures including Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Gavin Robinson, Gregory Campbell and Diane Dodds walked out while he was making his acceptance speech.Outgoing leader Arlene Foster also left early, and as a waiting media asked her for information on what was happening inside, a cheerful Mrs Foster quipped you#ll soon find out and flashed a peace sign.Paul Bell, a member of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP for over  years, emotionally quit and said the party would haemorrhage votes as a result of Mrs Foster#s treatment.The issue of nurses’ pay was back of the agenda. Alex Easton asked Health Minister Robin Swann, in an Assembly question, about plans for a pay rise in the coming year.Mr Swann responded: “The pay round for   for NHS and HSC staff has not yet been finalised. Any decision on a pay award for nurses and other NI health workers, will be taken after the pay review bodies make their recommendations..Mr Swann said he was “committed to a fair pay settlement for all our healthcare staff going forward”Friday: The fallout from the DUP#s leadership fiasco continued into Friday. After reports that Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told Thursday#s meeting that his campaign team had been subjected to threats and intimidation from the UDA, there were calls for a police investigation.Sinn Fein#s North Belfast MP John Finucane called the claims deeply disturbing.If true, this is a very worrying development that an armed, illegal organisation was involved in influencing the outcome of the leadership contest of the largest party in unionism and a party of government, he said.It represents an attempt to subvert the democratic process and that is totally unacceptable.Arlene Foster announced she would stand down from the role on Tuesdayher replacement Edwin Poots proceeds with an Executive reshuffle.She also had some advice for her successor: There are very many good people who vote for us, who support us but he needs to recognise there is a lot of work to do in terms of healing isions that are quite obviously there in the party..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolEdwin Poots braced for a raft of resignations as DUP implodesIRA man who killed Captain Robert Nairac was yards from Prince Charles during recent NI visitPortstewart fire on Bank Holiday Monday damages business premisesWatch: Police vehicle involved in serious collision in east BelfastTop VideosPlayPolice car involved in east Belfast RTCPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#Latest PoliticsUUP leader Doug Beattie warns DUP and Sinn Fein against collapsing StormontUlster Unionists more appealing than DUP, claims young loyalist who warned of possible violence over NI Protocol Brexit: Edwin Poots says no to Swiss-style deal on trade over Irish SeaBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorLatestFive charged over murder of Lincoln manJames Corden on when Carpool Karaoke could What the papers say – June Share Covid jabs with poorer nations to end iants threat, world leaders urgedJohn Barrowman thanks fans for support following flashing controversy,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Devine is the current Motorsport Ireland International Driver of the Year and is looking forward to ato the ERC series where he has produced a number of eye catching drives since he took a debut podium on Rally Hungary in . “I can’t wait to get my ERC season up and running,” Devine commented. We’ve got some testing under our belt in the new car and it feels really good, but there’s nothing better than actual competition to see where you’re at. googletag.cmd.push Rally Poland will be a new event to me as it didn’t run last year so we are going to do Rally Žemaitija in Lithuania as a warm up beforehand to get up to speed. Last year’s ERC campaign didn’t get off to a good start but we finished well and I’m hoping to take that momentum into . It takes a lot of backing to mount a challenge at this level and I’m delighted to welcome some new partners on board this season including Parts For Cars, Lyons of Limerick, Rentokil Initial, Trailerstuff.ie and Fire Protection Ireland. Without them and existing backers like Curran Gate, Pirelli, TST Transport, EARS Motorsport, Marina Racewear and the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy, this season just wouldn’t be possible.” googletag.cmd.push The move to a Ford will see Callumto a brand he’s rallied with before and M-Sport will be keeping a watchful eye on Callum’s progress this season.“The European Rally Championship has long been a proving ground for young talent looking to make their mark on the world stage, and it’s great to see another young driver choosing to take this route with the Fiesta. saidM-Sport Managing Director, Malcolm Wilson OBE. We’ve been aware of Callum for a number of years now following strong performances with the Fiesta R in Junior WRC and Fiesta R in Ireland. He’s got talent, and I’m keen to see what he can do as he tackles some ofEurope’s most famous events with the Fiesta Rally.”     M-Sport Ford Team Principal, Richard Millener added: “It’s great to see Callum back behind the wheel of the Fiesta and I’m looking forward to seeing what he can do this year. He had a great season with the Fiesta in , finishing third overall in the Irish Tarmac Championship and securing his first victory in Donegal – and we’re all keen to see him carry those performances onto the European stage. He’s already completed one year at this level, and now that he’s reunited with the Fiesta we want to help him take that next step. He’s got the initial experience under his belt, and we will give him as much support as we can to allow him to excel. The competition will be strong, but Callum is a very determined and talented young driver with the potential to surprise a few people this year.” Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy driver Devine will be joined for his ERC adventure by co-driver James Fulton and the Championship will consist of eight rounds taking place in Poland, Latvia, Italy, the Czech Republic, the Azores, Portugal, Hungary and Gran Canarias.   --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon announced a raft of new measures in a bidto improve facilities for pedestrians and increase public space in the city centre. The measures included the introduction of a one-way system from Carlisle Road, through Ferryquay Gate into The Diamond. It was stated in March that the new traffic system would be operational from April. However, it has still not begun. When contacted by the Derry News about the delay, a spokesperson for the Department for Infrastructuresaid it was anticipated that the scheme would now commence in early June. googletag.cmd.push “The Department and Derry City and Strabane District Council continue to work collaboratively to implement measures to help better share street space in the city centre in preparation for the relaxation of the Covid restrictions and an increase in pedestrian numbers. “It is planned to introduce a one way system in Ferryquay Street as a temporary intervention and introduce a priority system at Shipquay Gate to provide safer pedestrian access at this busy location. “The work is anticipated to commence in early June.” A spokesperson for the local council also confirmed that the traffic measure are expected to commence in early June and added that the council is working closely with the Department and contractors in bringing this forward. googletag.cmd.push “Further information in relation to the planned works and impact on traffic in the city centre will be communicated to the public in advance,” the council spokesperson added. It is planned that the one-way system at Ferryquay Street will be in place for  months. A review on its impact will then be made. As well as the Ferryquay Street plans, the new measures put forward also include the removal of the existing parking area at the quadrant outside the former Austin’s department store in the Diamond. A priority system for traffic is also to be introduced at Shipquay Gate which will allow a new footway to be created under this historic gate.     New spaces are also to be created on Bishop Street to facilitate outdoor trading opportunities for cafeacute-type businesses. The scheme has been agreed in partnership with the council as part of the Covid recovery process. Speaking in March when she announced the planned measures for Derrys city centre, Mrs Mallonsaid: “The Covid pandemic has brought many changes to how we conduct our daily lives and as we move towards a recovery phase I want to play my part in the transformation that our society deserves. This means creating a greener, cleaner more sustainable environment with less reliance on motor vehicles and a renewed focus on those who wish to walk, wheel and cycle. Once completed these measures will transform the Derry cityscape, providing safe spaces for all who work and live there to meet, shop and travel. “I am also committed to working with other local councils, stakeholders and local people so that we can shape our future together and deliver similar changes across our villages, towns and cities.”  --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After crossing the bridge, I head up the hill and pull the car in opposite the Vivo and the magnicently named Rio Grande bar. Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill. Rain starts to fall as a mother guides her toddler out the doors of the Vivo, one hand clutching hers and the other gripping the bottle of juice he has just been bought. googletag.cmd.push A large plastic ice cream cone sits hopefully outside the shop. Up the hill comes a learner driver seemingly on a lesson. She stops outside Learmount Resource Centre and disappears into the building, before emerging with her child in tow to resume her lesson. A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed.     “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations. It may need to be done across Parks Rio Grande, rather than inside it.  --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Arts Council this week announced funding ofpoundm for arts organisations throughout Northern Ireland. The Arts Council’s Annual Funding Programmeis the most signicant allocation of public funding for the arts in Northern Ireland each year. Void Gallery in Derry is to receive pound,, while Greater Shantallow Community Artsis to be allocated pound,. GSCA aims to provide direct access to the arts for those living in disadvantaged communities. GSCA is core funded by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland which enables the organisation to offer a year-round programme of creative activities benefitting over  people every week, delivered from their community arts centre, Studio . googletag.cmd.push The local group has received Arts Council funding to support the employment of a dance officer to develop their dance classes. Void Gallery’s programme focuses on the collaborative nature of art and its ability to add to artistic discourse through exhibitions, events, discussions and partnerships. Through their commissions they work with a network of arts organisations both nationally and internationally to create specic projects. Liam Hannaway,chair of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, welcomed the latest funding support. “This year’s annual allocation of exchequer and National Lottery funding is largely standstill for most of our key arts organisation,” he said. “In order to mitigate the continuing impact of Covid-, we have already released upfront payments of % of last year’s grant to  applicants. googletag.cmd.push “This offers an element of stability to many amidst current programming and strategic uncertainty, as the sector prepares to reopen. Commenting on the department’s funding allocation to ACNI, Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey,said, said such support was an important part of the foundations on which the work of our vital arts and creative sector is built. “These awards come at a point where the Executive has agreed a series of important relaxations that will make a real dference for participation in the arts and with the Culture, Arts and Heritage Recovery Taskforce beginning its work. “Taken together these represent an important contribution to supporting the peopleand organisations who work across the arts to be able to do their important work.     “I recognise the pressure that continues to be felt financially, creatively and at a personal level across the creative community, even as we begin the process of reopening and recovery. “I also recognise that more support will be needed this year and so I was particularly pleased to welcome the Executive’s decision last week to allocate a further round of poundm Covid funding to Arts, Culture and Heritage to support the social recovery.”  --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She is doing great now, she loves Gaelic football and is a bundle of energy. “Young Lives vs Cancer relies on donations and it has been so good as a family to be able to fundraise annually.     “Each year the support has grown, we now have sons and daughters of people that first took part. “Last year we held a virtual concert that raised more than pound, and this year we decided to do a k walk run over bank holiday weekend with a raffle – the top prize being pound. “The raffle will be held at Molly’s Bar Iona House, Spencer Road at pm sharp. “We are fundraising for two charities this year as sadly Molly Moran, a treasured committee member of the Gerard Logue Memorial Fund passed away last year.

His -year playing career ended on the Evergreens in the early s.Joersquos role as match secretary for twenty years was absolutely crucial given his unique ability to dig out players when all seemed lost, recruiting players at Down High on Saturday mornings to fulfil fixtures later that day.Complete strangers would often turn up for second  matches in the early days saying that Joe had instructed them to turn up and play.Despite his tireless work on behalf of the club, Joersquos greatest pleasure throughout his rugby le has been the friends he has made along the way.A keen tourist, he has travelled the world to follow rugby and even took in some of the Lions fixtures in South Africa in .He was tour manager on the legendary  Ballynahinch tour of Canada, as well as partaking in a few trips away with the Evergreens.When promotion to the All-Ireland League was secured in , Joe was a regular spectator at games all over the country and could be seen at every first XV home fixture in his familiar spot on the m line until very recently.The flat cap, long navy Adidas coat, familiar cough and half pint of Harp should conjure up an image of Joe to everyone who knows him, and to countless others who have passed through the Ballynahinch club in recent years not knowing the huge influence he has had on their rugby.Joe is the recipient of the coveted Spence Cup this season. He is truly deserving of this award and it is le-affirming to see that friendships gained through team sports run deep as Sam Robinson, himself a Spence Cup winner, acts as carer for Joe as his health deteriorates.Rugby it seems, is giving something back to one of itrsquos finest local servants.On behalf of the Spence family, Emma Rice commened: ldquoThe Spence Cup is given to a member who shows an example of commitment to the rugby club. Joe Carlislersquos service to the club in time and deed epitomises this.ldquoA society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. We are often guilty of not noticing a tree that gives the shade we sit under, she continued.ldquoPlayers of today may no longer see as much of that familiar face on the m line at Ballymacarn Park, but they will see the roots, the structure, the shade and benefit from what wee Joe once planted. Thank you and congratulations, Joe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business owners join forces in their love of baking  ","story":"THEY became virtual supporters of each otherrsquos business during lockdown mdash now two women bakers are working together to raise money for dementia research.Ciara Van Vogt, the owner of Margaretrsquos Cottage BB in Ardglass and Sharon Campbell from Mrs Crsquos Home Kitchen in Dundrum, have raised pound, so far for the Alzheimerrsquos Society from an online bake sale.They supported each otherrsquos business efforts through lockdown last year by connecting on social media but did not meet in person until March.When they did, the two ladies struck up an immediate friendship and decided to put their skills together and collaborate on a project.Sharon said: ldquoDuring lockdown charities have really suffered and there are many worthy causes out there, we both agreed it was hard to support just one.ldquoBoth businesses support their own inidual local charities and will continue to do, but we chose to support an Alzheimerrsquos charity because we both know many people affected by this awful disease.Ciara is a carer for her elderly mother, Mrs Eithne Fitzsimons, who was diagnosed with Alzheimerrsquos disease four years ago.ldquoI lose a bit of Mum every week, and sometimes Mum doesnrsquot know who I am, said Ciara.ldquoLockdown has stopped support groups and activities for people with dementia. Itrsquos been very challenging for carers and their loved ones, and people often forget that carersrsquo lives are adversely affected too.ldquoImagine having a spouse or parent who no longer recognises you and who due to this awful disease you no longer recognise.One of the things that resonates with both women is the thought of any loved one losing all our precious memories.Ciara continued: ldquoResearch into the causes of, and treatment for dementia is critically important but not a priority for UK governments.ldquoWe would love to see this dreadful disease eradicated for future generations. We both have strong ties to Northern Ireland, being from here, although we both spent time living and working in England and Scotland before moving home to settle back in Co Down. Our mutual love of baking and cooking was how we met and became friends.The two bakers organised a virtual bake sale to raise money for dementia research.However they soon realised that due to geography not everyone could buy their fabulous baking, so they set up a JustGiving page to run alongside the bake sale.ldquoPlanning the challenges of a bake sale during lockdown was fun, so too was choosing some of our most popular products to sell to raise money, said Sharon.ldquoThe menu proved so popular. Within ten days we both realised we wouldnrsquot get much sleep as baking for Alzheimerrsquos became a top priority.Early mornings and late nights meant that customers received their sweet treats and funds are still being raised by the pair.If you want to check out their Just Giving page, details are: https:www.justgiving fundraising sharonandciarasbakesale and both ladies can be found on Facebook and Instagram..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Campbell.jpg","title":"Campbell on form as Duns claim derby win  ","story":"DUNDRUM firsts defeated derby rivals Downpatrick by  runs on Friday evening to continue their push for a semi-final spot in the T Shield.Dundrum travelled to the Strangford Road after their pitch was deemed unplayable after heavy rain with the home side winning the toss and, on a cold damp evening, chose to field first.Dundrum opened with Greg Hutley and Stuart Campbell while Downpatrick opened the bowling with Justin Rea and Marty Gartland.Dundrum got off to a fast start adding  for the first wicket inside the first six overs before Hutley was dismissed for  off the bowling of Gartland.Dundrumrsquos run rate began to halt as a result of the combination of good Downpatrick bowling and a slow outfield.Terry Hutley and Campbell added  for the next wicket before Dundrum lost four quick wickets in the form of Campbell , Hutley , James Martinand Joel Maguire .This left Dundrum  for five with Downpatrick on top as Ian Wright and Gavin McNerlin added  for the next wicket before another clump of wickets fell to leave Dundrum  for nine after  overs.McNerlin managed to get Dundrum to  for nine from their  overs as he finished on  not out.The pick of the Downpatrick bowlers was James Ferguson who finished with figures of  for  from his four overs and the game was very much in the balance heading into the second innings.Downpatrick opened with brothers Michael and Daniel Carson whilst Dundrum elected to open the bowling with Davy Glover and Daniel Kearsley.Similar to Dundrumrsquos innings, Downpatrick got off to a fast start, putting on  for the first wicket inside the first six overs.The Downpatrick men combined well and began running fluently between the wickets to put the pressure on the Dundrum bowlers.Daniel Carsonwas dismissed off the bowling of Davy Glover after a good catch by Andrew Foster in the dee, with Paul Linehan next to the crease to join Michael Carson.Linehan looked to be aggressive, hitting a big six to keep the pressure on Dundrum as the two batsmen took the score to  for  inside nine overs.However, Dundrum began to fight back through Campbell and McNerlin. The former dismissed both Carson and Linehan in the same over to swing the match back in favour for Dundrum.This started a Downpatrick collapse with the last eight wickets falling for only  runs. McNerlin finished with figures of  for  from four overs while Campbell finished with  for  from his four overs, completing a -run win for Dundrum.It was a fantastic fight back for Dundrum and Downpatrick will know they let the game get away from them.Dundrum would like to thank Downpatrick Cricket Club for hosting the game with the match ball sponsored by Aiden McCabe from AMC building.Dundrum -Downpatrick  all outT SHIELD.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Despair.jpg","title":"Despair for Down in second defeat  ","story":"DOWN were second best to a Meath side who ran out comfortable winners by a margin of seven points at Armaghrsquos Athletic Grounds on Sunday.Down were forfeiting their home advantage as a result of breaching the GAArsquos Covid- regulations during lockdown and perhaps that, coupled with the torrid weather conditions, attributed to their performance.Paddy Tally signicantly reshuffled his starting line-up following their opening day defeat against Mayo in Castlebar.The Down manager made a total of five changes, with goalkeeper Marc Reid and captain Darren OrsquoHagan the most notable of them all.Meath began the sharper of the two sides, but Down could not fault lady luck as their opponents were reduced to  men following a Eoin Harkey black card.The red and black outfit failed to take advantage of their additional man as Meath began scoring points through Cathal Hickey, Mathew Costello and Andrew Colgan.Corey Quinn did manage to score two points before the quarter for the Mourne county, but he also failed to convert a goal scoring chance which set the tone for the afternoon.The game was not away from Down at this stage as Quinn added to his tally alongside scores from Paul Devlin and Ryan McElroy to trail by only two points at half-time.It was a reverse in roles for the second half, as this time it was Down player Jonny Flynn who was shown the black card, leaving his side down a man.Unlike Down, Meath took full advantage of the extra shirt on the pitch and Cillian OrsquoSullivan buried two goals just before and after the third quarter to put the contest out of sight.Referee Niall Cullen was kept busy with his cards, this time displaying a red to Downrsquos Gerard McGovern to close out a miserable afternoon for Tallyrsquos men.Down now travel to Mullingar this Sunday, where they face off against Westmeath at Cusack Park.Down: M Reid P Fegan, G McGovern, P Murdock, P Laverty, D OrsquoHagan, C Mooney, R McEvoy , J Flynn, J Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , L Kerr, D Guinness, C Quinn , P Devlin .Subs: C Doherty for J Guinness , P Branagan for Mooney , S McConville for Kerr , G Collins for D OrsquoHagan , C Gough for Flynn , C McCrickardfor B OrsquoHagan , D Savage for Quinn Meath: A Colgan , S Lavin, C McGill, C Hickey , E Harkin, S McEntee, D Keogan, B Menton, P Harnan, E Devine , B McMahon , M Costello , J Morris , T OrsquoReilly , C OrsquoSullivan .Subs: R Ryan for Harkin , J Wallace for OrsquoReilly , E Wallacefor Hickey , J Scully for McMahon , J Conlon for Morris , D Campion for OrsquoSullivan , G McCoy for McEntee Referee: Niall Cullen Down -Meath -NFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Dozens.jpg","title":"Dozens walk in memory of Seaforde Special Olympian  ","story":"UPWARDS of  people took part in a charity walk around Castlewellan Lake on Saturday in memory of Seaforde man Glenn McBride, who died  weeks ago.Glennwas a medalled Special Olympics competitor who enjoyed soccer and basketball, playing both to a high standard.He was a popular member of of Down Special Olympics Club in Downpatrick and Shimna Stars Special Olympics Club in Newcastle.Glenn won a soccer gold medal with Team Down at the Area Games in Belfast in  and was a member of the Ulster soccer team at the Ireland Games the following year.

None of the men, who were wearing wet suits and le jackets, were seriously injured and it is believed adverse weather conditions caused the boat to overturn, said a Coastguard spokeswoman.As this incident was closing and the helicopter had just landed the casualties, Coastguards then received information that two young boys were being blown offshore in a small boat close to Ballyhornan.ldquoThe helicopter was re-tasked and itrsquos crew stood by with members of the Ardglass Coastguard unit, but the children, who were aged  and , were able to make it back to shore safely, she added.SAINTFIELD ndash Teenagers in Saintfield are being blamed for vandalising stone walls and blocking a river in the town.Concerned residents in Shrewsbury Dale have voiced their concern about what is happening and asked local councillor Robert Burgess to address the problem.Mr Burgess said residents and local farmers are becoming increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the teenagers and highlighted the importance of making them realise the error of their ways.He explained that over the past number of months, children have punched holes in local hedgerows to gain access to fields adjacent to the Shrews-bury Dale housing development.ldquoLivestock and horses have been in the fields concerned and we have to be thankful they did not escape as a result of the childrenrsquos action, Mr Burgess continued..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-NewPlaypark.jpg","title":"New £50k play park at Downpatrick school  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK primary school has officially opened its new pound, playground and garden facilities.St Colmcillersquos Primary School in Glebetown Drive now has a new sensory garden called the Rainbow garden, an outdoor play park and a new welcome garden at the schoolrsquos front door.School principal Stephen Austin said the facilities were financed by pound, raised by the careful management of the school budget and pound, from the schoolrsquos Parents, Teachers and Friends Association .Planns were drawn up last June and the work by contractor, All Play Ballynahinch, began in January.Mr Austin explained: ldquoThe school is set on a spacious site with several large green areas.ldquoI wanted to maximise the learning potential of our school site to improve pupils holistic learning experiences, particularly within the areas of outdoor education, activity based and play based learning which are essential areas of the curriculum and so important in eliciting enthusiasm in learning and developing key skills in core areas such as literacy, numeracy, ICT and STEAM.ldquoI also wanted to enhance facilities for our wonderful children who deserve the best and who were disadvantaged by interruptions to their schooling in recent times due to the Covid pandemic. But also to strengthen school community and pride in our fantastic school.Mr Austin paid tribute to the schools PTFA for its fundraising, to the board of governors for support and a group of volunteers who worked on the welcome garden.ldquoThe team spirit that has been displayed throughout this project has been uplting and a reflection of the strong school community that exists within St Colmcilles Primary School, he said.ldquoThe board of governors have supported this project throughout and are committed to a cycle of continuous improvement of all aspects of the school, especially its facilities and resourcesHe continued: ldquoThe PTFA have fundraised relentlessly through organising ious raffles, draws, bingos and hampers. They have enjoyed amazing support from our parents and the whole school community who all have been very generous. So far, they have contributed pound, to the project which has allowed us to go the extra mile with more extensive resources and a very high spec finish in the ious areas.He said that the welcome garden was created almost exclusively by volunteers such as grandparent Stephen Vaughan, who built the planter boxes, the garden furniture was designed and constructed by brothers Lawrence and Gareth Blaney, the circular stone planter built by parent Fergus Rooney , grounds work was carried out by Pascal Magee and planting by Bill Carew. Plants and shrubs were provided at a discounted rate from Cunningham Flowers in Dundrum.The schoolrsquos head of outdoor education, Sean McReynolds, oversaw the project with building supervisors Brian Tweedie and Bill Carew, classroom assistant Ryan Craig and Gemma Vaughan, the schoolrsquos eco co-ordinator.Parent Roisin McKenna, who along with Andrea McMenamin, Natasha Shields and Rosaleen Cunlfe leads the PTFA committee, said that they had enjoyed ldquoamazing support from parents, the wider school community and local businesses.Roisin said: ldquoThe ethos of our PTFA is about \"making memories\" and this is always at the forefront of our fundraising. We wanted the money we raised to benefit every child in the school and therefore the school have all the children timetabled for outdoor learning everyday.ldquoThis makes our fundraising all worthwhile when you see happy children playing daily outdoors.The PTFA organised fundraising initiatives like bingo, raffles, hampers and draws which have allowed the school to further develop the footprint of the planned facilities for the children.The schoolrsquos Rainbow garden includes a tepee, a water wall for directing and controlling the flow of water, an activity table, a water and sand tray, outdoor shelter, sensory plants with a vivid colour or smell and plastic coated activity table where children can paint use sand and textiles to show their learning.Therersquos also an outdoor classroom which can hold up to  pupils and adults with bespoke seating and a blackboard with outdoor musical equipment.Itrsquos contained within ranch style fencing and is very popular with all the schoolrsquos pupils, particularly those within its learning support centres, many of whom have complex sensory needs.The new play park contains swings, slide, climbing tower, monkey bars, balance equipment, ropes, seesaws seating and planting areas.Children are timetabled at break and lunch times and for certain lessons throughout the day.An eye-catching circular stone planter has been filled with a iety of shrubs and trees in the new Welcome garden.Therersquos also a bespoke reading area overlooking four large rectangular sleeper planter boxes filled with beautul summer flowers, a solar powered water fountain, a bird bath and bird tables..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Politicians.jpg","title":"Politicians gather to mark Northern Ireland centenary  ","story":"CROSSGAR marked Northern Irelandrsquos centenary on Monday with a special event.A number of local politicians including South Down MLA Harry Harvey and Rowallane councillors Billy Walker, Terry Andrews, Robert Burgess and Kathryn Owen met in the village square with each holding a torch which symbolised what happened in Crossgar a century ago when the province was formed.On that occasion, a bonfire was lit in the square by local residents to celebrate the creation of Northern Ireland on election night of the new parliament.The local MP was Sir James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who had personal ties to Crossgar and had been its Westminster MP since .To mark the national and local event, local politicians from all parties were invited to hold a flame in a triangular shape on Monday symbolising the fire that was lit on the birth of the country in .Cllr Walker said he was delighted to have been invited to Crossgar to take part in the special event to mark Northern Irelandrsquos th birthday..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to Down Rec soccer legend Jim Connolly  ","story":"JIM Connolly died on April  after a hard fought two year battle with illness.His passing was marked by a phenomenal level of tributes.Social media,work colleagues, team-mates and opponents alike expressed how well liked and respected he was in all walks of le.He was first and last a family man whether it was his brothers and sisters, Angie and his children or his beloved grandchildren.However Coot, as he was known, had another family which he held dear. He had been a vital cog in the Down Rec team which enjoyed great success in the late Seventies.But it was and remains the case that the Down Rec experience is defined by the enduring friendships which have stood the test of time.Coot grew up in Stream Street and the reason he knocked back opportunities to perform at levels his talent merited may well lie there.That part of Downpatrick had three working class housing developments, Ardpatrick and Russell Park with Stream Street and Ibrox Park in the middle.Ibrox was their playground, the place where Coot first kicked a football.He was a Stream Street kid and it seems he never wanted to be anything .When Jim Prior took him to Down Rec, it was a marriage made in heaven.In that dressing room you had another more senior Stream Street kid. Coot would have idolized Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran in those days as he was the leader of the pack.Russell Park resident Barney Fitzsimmons was there too, a swashbuckling goalscorer who enjoyed something akin to Roy of the Rovers status at the time.Then you had the late great Paddy lsquoGeordyrsquo Galbraith, who combined a hard man reputation with a heart of gold.Peter Mulhall was another player he would have admired, a winner who proved the perfect centre back partner for the laid-back Coot.The total respect he had for them was accorded to all of us even though he was a better player than any of us. That was Coot Connolly.Prior realized that he needed to recruit from outside Downpatrick to fulfill his ambitions for the club and over a period of time he recruited players from Portaferry, Strangford, Ardglass, Dundrum, Crossgar, Saintfield, Killyleagh and Ballygowan.They were brought in for their ability but Jim couldnrsquot have known that the erse personalities therein would create the perfect storm in the dressing room.Neither could he have anticipated the level of support which flowed from those villages in the seasons to come.Dressing rooms are bastions of banter and slagging and with Dart jester-in chief, the group relished every minute they spent together.The five strong Portaferry contingent proved to be a vital ingredient, their earthy Ards humour and the opportunities their accents provided for slagging sealing their popularity.Jackie Leckey and Barney Ross brought another dimension willing as they were to join in the shenanigans on and off the pitch. Coot loved the craic and happily joined in the banter.However, he left the slagging to other less sensitive creatures of which there were plenty.A good example was the time I decided to get the footballers perm which was in vogue at the time. I should have known better.I got slaughtered, Dart declaring that I looked more like Shirley Temple than Kevin Keegan.Those were the days, as the saying goes, but happily there were plenty of good days ahead of us.We have had many reunions with Coot, an ever present and every one of them underlined the strength of the bond we enjoy so much.Sadly those reunions tend to be confined to wakes and funerals nowadays and the baby of our team has now joined Shane Breen, Paddy Galbraith and Marty Ross on the sidelines.Coot would have been the first to remind me that the Rec wasnrsquot only about the players.The one and only Charlie Oakes was highly influential in his role as assistant manager, while Austy Keating doubled as chairman and groundsman for many years.Joe Lyttle was our physio and his son Joea loyal player for years while my sister Tina was a committee member and a fanatical fan.They were all fully paid up members of the Rec family and we continue to mourn their loss.I would love to have name checked every single member of the Rec family in this piece but time and space didnrsquot allow. My apologies.The laughter which rang through Cootrsquos house during his wake was a fitting farewell for someone who loved to laugh.He was a very special human being. We will miss him forever.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He raised concerns that the hundreds of new houses in and around Llantwit Major arenrsquot seeing the increased investment in local public services needed to cater for the growing population.He said: ldquoThere are more and more houses in the town. Therersquos hardly any green space left and our services are really struggling.Two doctors surgeries currently cater for the town: Coastal Vale and Western Vale.
