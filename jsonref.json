I thought I got on well with her. She said some very unpleasant things.\u0027Unpleasant? What was said about him was downright heartless.          He said he remained deeply wounded by what he sees as a gross betrayal by fellow broadcaster, Clare Balding           An extract from an email Balding sent to Channel 4\u0027s boss Jay Hunt read: \u0027...although he is ranting on about ageism like a loon, I think he probably deserves a call from the top.

Her other companion is Anglo-Asian police officer Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill).In last Sunday’s episode, the Doctor and her companions travelled back in time to the moment black bus passenger Rosa Parks ignited the US civil rights movement.          For some viewers, Jodie Whittaker’s debut series as the Time Lord has become a tiresome ordeal of political correctnessOne fan wrote: ‘There should be a clever story line, not a rehash of history. There’s also an underlying feeling the focus has been forcing inclusiveness by having such obviously erse characters.’Another said: ‘Please keep the PC stuff for documentaries and serious drama and let the Doctor help us escape to a fantasy world.’Similar criticism is likely to follow an upcoming episode called Demons Of The Punjab, set during the Partition of India in 1947.But Frazer Hines, who played the Doctor’s companion Jamie McCrimmon between 1966 and 1969, said: ‘I was a bit worried about the Rosa Parks episode because race is obviously a sensitive issue, but I thought it was very well done.’  First, we had the Rosa Parks race relations plot... Last week’s storyline – in which the Doctor and her companions come to the rescue of heroic civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks in Alabama in 1955 – may have been ideal for Black History Month but its heavy-handed message led one fan to dub it the ‘racism-is-bad episode’.           The Doctor and her companions come to the rescue of heroic civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks in Alabama in 1955Next, we\u0027ll be told we did bad things in IndiaThe political education in the Rosa Parks episode will continue in the upcoming Demons Of The Punjab – set during the Partition of India in 1947 and guest-starring Shane Zaza (Happy Valley). It’s likely to show the evil consequences of the British Empire and colonialism, as the Doctor’s companion Yasmin goes back in time to search for her grandmother.            The political education in the Rosa Parks episode will continue in the upcoming Demons Of The Punjab, set in India in 1947The Doctor is too busy preaching to fight any aliens...In the opening episode, the Doctor pleads with psychotic alien Tzim-Sha – his face encrusted with the teeth of his victims – to look deep inside himself and leave his murderous ways behind. Unsurprisingly, the preachy approach doesn’t work and the Time Lord is forced to resort to more drastic action.

The choir sang at the Invictus closing ceremony          As always when these Games close, I would like to start by saying thank you.To PK and Lieutenant General Peter Lay and the whole Sydney 2018 team - the vision and hard work has paid off and you have put on a truly magnificent Invictus Games.Thank you for being our partners over the last couple of years, and our team at the Invictus Games Foundation, especially Dominic Reid and Rose Hall, for their tireless efforts and hard work.To the people of Australia who filled the stands and cheered on the sidelines - thank you so much. Your energy powered our competitors all week and you made these Games your own by creating a typically Aussie atmosphere.To the friends and families who got our competitors to the start line and applauded them all the way to the finish line, thank you. You are all part of one big Invictus family and none of us would be here without you.And to the competitors goes the biggest thanks of all. You have once again left us humbled and inspired by your example, by your determination, by your service and by your sense of humour.Last Saturday, I spoke about how you were part of the Invictus generation. Your choice to serve your nations places you alongside those storied generations that have come before you, that fought two world wars and then secured a world order built on freedom, democracy, and tolerance.And of course this choice to serve - this choice to put yourselves at risk for the benefit of others - is at the very heart of what I founded these Invictus Games to celebrate. I wanted your service to be recognised.But what we saw again this week is that Invictus is so much more. Your example goes beyond the military community. It is about more than just your inspiring stories of recovery from injury and illness.It is about your example of determination, of optimism, of strength, honour and friendship, or as the Aussies call it \u0027mateship\u0027, as a core value that has the power to inspire the world.When we saw Paul Guest and Edwin Vermetten support each other through Paul\u0027s struggle with Post Traumatic Stress on the tennis court in front of a large audience, we saw what mateship really looks like.When Jakub Tynka fought through excruciating leg pain for the final 20 minutes of his cycling event, and let the cheering crowd and his fellow competitors Benjamin and Cedric push him over the finish line, we saw the definition of strength.When you saw Hannah Stolberg crossing the finish line on a bike which belonged to a late fellow serviceman whose values she strives to emulate, you witnessed the real meaning of honour.

Meghan referenced his courage in her speechIn travelling to these military bases, I was given a very special glimpse into the lives of those who serve our countries. I was able to see the unshakeable bond between servicemen and women on the ground together, but at the same time to feel the palpable longing for family and friends while deployed. Once home, the need for that anchor of support from loved ones, especially given how much it accelerates recovery and rehailitation is immeasurable. I\u0027ve been reminded of those memories here.During this year\u0027s Games in Sydney, I have witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors, and I\u0027ve had the privilege of meeting several of these family and friends. The Novack family from Chicago is a prime example of this very thing. When their son, Ryan, suffered a severe injury leaving him paralysed from the waist down, doctors said he would never be able to walk again, but after speaking to his mum, Kerry, it was clear that it was through Ryan\u0027s strength of spirit and with the unwaivering support of his parents that he was able to prove all of those doctors wrong.Not only has Ryan competed in sailing, swimming and athletics this week, but when Harry and I saw him at the finish line of the sailing competition, he literally jumped into our boat, with dexterity and ease by the way, to give both of us a hug.Seeing Ryan\u0027s mum on the water that day, waving a flag to cheer him on was a moment I will never forget. The support system on the ground here in Invictus is something unlike any other because it\u0027s not just cheering on your own, but realising that by the end of this week, your own becomes everyone in the Invictus Family.It was, after all, only within 24 hours of meeting other families at the Games that another competitor\u0027s little girl was calling Kerry Aunty Kerry. This is what the Invictus Family is all about.On that note, I would like to invite everyone to please join me in a huge round of applause to thank all of the friends and family who have helped make these Games possible. Meghan turned heads in tuxedo-inspired Antonio Berardi halterneck in a green hue with a buttoned wrap detail around the waist that perfectly skimmed her growing baby bump.She accessorised with a crescent-shaped clutch bag and added a dazzling touch to the ensemble with statement earrings beneath her delicate chignon while Harry looked dapper in a light grey suit and white shirt.The couple earlier returned to Sydney just in time to watch the final day of the Games before heading to New Zealand for the last leg of their Commonwealth tour. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex  arrived at the wheelchair basketball final just after the match started at 2.10pm, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd. After the final whistle, pregnant Meghan went on court to give the Netherlands and USA players their medals and one cheeky Dutch player kissed her on the cheek.The bold move was technically a breach of protocol because the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with a neck bow (from the head only) - but informal Meghan touched the player on the shoulder and smiled as he kissed her. The Duchess was glowing in a $550 maroon crepe knit wrap top by Australian designer Scanlan Theodore. She wore a Remembrance Day poppy on her left side and paired the top with black tapered trousers and high heels.           A cheeky Dutch player gave Meghan a kiss on the cheek after the final whistle. According to Royal.uk the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with \u0027a neck bow (from the head only).

It has nine bedrooms and a swimming pool and looks onto Willow Canyon and the grounds of the stunning Santa Catalina nature reserve. In an interview in 2010, Sir Philip said of his stay at Canyon Ranch: \u0027To have time, space. It was spectacular. There were blue skies, you\u0027re walking and see mountains.\u0027I had time to think in an open space and was in a completely different zone.

He\u0027d put his hand up the back of her skirt – apparently getting a kick from both her boyfriend\u0027s ignorance and her powerlessness to stop him.\u0027Why did no one challenge him sooner,\u0027 the buyer asked me. \u0027Who\u0027s to say a hand cupping a buttock is worse than being shouted at while you\u0027re on the phone to a supplier in the Far East – yelling that you must make them drop their prices.\u0027It got to the point I felt sick every Sunday night at the prospect of going to work.

So the British fashion industry\u0027s deafening silence since Thursday has been shocking – but entirely predictablePhilip Green has bullied me since I conducted my first interview with him for the London Evening Standard, in November 2005. I met him in his boardroom at Arcadia HQ on Berners Street with its view of the London Eye before his chauffeur and bodyguard, Kevin, drove us to the Royal Academy, where his brands – Topshop, Evans, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Burton – were showing their wares to the press. In the limo, he chain-smoked Philip Morris – \u0027I have to have one pleasure in life\u0027 – and slagged off every designer store we passed. \u0027Stella McCartney? Never made two bob.\u0027 When I asked about his employees, his reputation as a rottweiler, he told me: \u0027I give a straight yes or no. They are empowered.\u0027He introduced me to his wife, Tina (who owns 92 per cent of Arcadia shares) and 14-year-old daughter, Chloe. When I later wrote that Chloe was wearing mukluk boots, which are made of fur, something banned in his stores, he complained to my editor, a soignee woman who that morning had no need of a blow dry.But he could be loyal.

He called me, swearing, and told me I was \u0027anti-Semitic\u0027. \u0027No,\u0027 I said. \u0027These girls don\u0027t have much money. You were grooming them.\u0027 As, over the years, I refused to fawn over him, his mood swung between extremes. After I wrote a rave review of one collection, he sent me a gorgeous olive greatcoat, still warm from the model who\u0027d worn it. Later, after a bad review, his right-hand woman called me. \u0027He wants his coat back.\u0027The last time I spoke to Green was at an Evans show in the autumn of 2014. He\u0027d sat me front row of this plus-size show (now that\u0027s a laugh in Oliver Shah\u0027s biography, he is reported to have told a female buyer: \u0027You\u0027re absolutely f****** useless. I should throw you out the window but you\u0027re so fat you\u0027d probably bounce back in again\u0027), as I\u0027d been at the vanguard of a campaign to give big women the fashion they deserve. Afterwards he asked if we could pose together for the paparazzi. I said no. Unlike every female glossy editor in the land, I felt to do so would betray my readers. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to stand next to him, gurning.          I can\u0027t help but remember the image, at his show inside the old Eurostar terminal in Waterloo, of American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, looking like the cat who got the zero fat cream because Green had arranged for her own personal escalator on which to glide in, and glide out (when approached for this story, her silence was deafening). Above, at Tate Britain in 2016Everyone in fashion knew he was a tyrant, but it\u0027s unreasonable to expect teenage models and junior employees to stand up to him you might wonder why anyone would sign a gagging order, but this was a seriously powerful man.So it was the responsibility of the senior company executives, editors, publishing directors and model agents to be on the side of the women who toil in low-paid jobs in stores and factories and lap up glossy fashion magazines.I can\u0027t help but remember the image, at his show inside the old Eurostar terminal in Waterloo, of American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, looking like the cat who got the zero fat cream because Green had arranged for her own personal escalator on which to glide in, and glide out (when approached for this story, her silence was deafening).I can\u0027t help but think back to the meetings of magazine editors and London Fashion Week bigwigs in the boardroom of Vogue House, where not one woman had the courage to say, \u0027What can we do about Philip Green?\u0027Or, later, as the BHS scandal erupted and the pension hole gaped, why even then did not one of them take him to task over the number of employees his greed was condemning to penury?My guess? They were too busy counting his advertising spend, and nursing their 40 per cent Topshop discount card.Even today, when I ask Caroline Rush CBE, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, who will have had more dealings with Green than most, if she ever took him to task, I\u0027m told her PA is away on honeymoon. I email the British Fashion Council press office and ask them to call her on her mobile. How bad is this for British fashion? Will he show next season? She doesn\u0027t ring back. It is her job to reply. This is what she is paid to do.Or Baroness Karren Brady CBE (don\u0027t you love all these titles?), who has been vocal about fighting sexism in business, and has been chair of Arcadia\u0027s parent company, Taveta, for eight years.I ask if she knew of allegations that Green gave female staff \u0027lingering hugs\u0027 and asked if they wanted their \u0027bottoms slapped\u0027 or, indeed, had paid substantial sums to settle complaints. Only her PA gets back to me: \u0027Karren is away until next week.\u0027 But this is important! She\u0027s got a phone, hasn\u0027t she? I visit her glorious villa next to Harrods no one answers the door.How about Naomi Campbell, who publicly attacked former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman – now a Mail on Sunday columnist – for having too many white staff? Did Naomi ever find Green racist? No reply.How about Kate Moss? Would she like to offer her support to him, given he\u0027d been so loyal to her in the past? She was \u0027about to get on a plane\u0027, apparently.Or Edward Enninful OBE, new super-erse editor of UK Vogue? No reply.Come on, then, Natalie Massenet, Net-a-Porter founder and one-time chair of the British Fashion Council? She can\u0027t be scared of anyone. She\u0027s a bleeding Dame! I get an email. \u0027Natalie is going to reach out to you.\u0027 I\u0027m still waiting.Isn\u0027t it telling that the only powerful person in British fashion I can find who is willing to speak out about Green is a man – although he doesn\u0027t want me to use his name.No longer employed by Topshop, he tells me: \u0027He\u0027s outrageous. This is all typical of him. Doing it in the first place is unacceptable, covering it up is ridiculous.\u0027Is he a sexual predator, a racist? \u0027The real issue is this: he will never be aware that he has done anything wrong. He just doesn\u0027t get it, he will never change.\u0027Is that why he left Green\u0027s company? \u0027I left because I didn\u0027t like the way he treated people. My mum told me that we are all equal, and that we should treat everyone with respect. He didn\u0027t treat anyone with respect.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/09/4F0F74EA00000578-6054417-image-a-19_1534147776400.jpg","title":"Prince Carl Philip Sweden reveals secretly living dyslexia","story":"    Prince Carl Philip of Sweden (pictured with wife Princess Sofia and their sons) has revealed he is dyslexic and that it was \u0027horrible\u0027 when people ridiculed him for misreading a namePrince Carl Philip of Sweden has revealed he is dyslexic and that it was \u0027horrible\u0027 when he was mocked by bullies for misreading a name on TV.Two million people watched the Prince, 39, stumble over the name of a winner in a sporting competition five years ago and many taunted him online.However the backlash inspired the Swedish Royal to go public with his condition.He has also set up a foundation to help others with dyslexia and combat cyber-bullying, reports the Sunday Times.Prince Carl Philip said: \u0027People were very tough on me.

After the incident was reported in the newspapers, a \u0027Boycott Relief Fund\u0027 was established and volunteers from Belfast arrived to harvest the crop.          The word \u0027dunce\u0027 is derived from a 13th-century monk, John Duns Scotus (pictured)Dunce — someone who is slow at learningThe word \u0027dunce\u0027 is derived from a 13th-century monk, John Duns Scotus.Scotus — who hailed from the village of Duns in Scotland — was a theologian of great repute. Indeed his scholarship remains highly esteemed in the Catholic Church and he was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1993 — the first step to becoming a saint.During the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, Catholic teachings were widely criticised, and adherents of Scotus\u0027s beliefs were characterised as too stupid to think for themselves. Anyone espousing his theories became known as \u0027Duns\u0027 and considered intellectually inferior.Foxtrot — a ballroom danceThe foxtrot is said to have been invented by vaudeville entertainer Harry Fox in 1914 when he began performing a fast yet simple trotting-style dance during his performances at the New York Theatre.The dance was immediately popular in clubs, and by the end of 1914 the American Society Of Professors Of Dancing decided to teach it as the Foxtrot.          The foxtrot is said to have been invented by vaudeville entertainer Harry Fox (pictured) in 1914 when he began performing a fast yet simple trotting-style dance during his performances at the New York TheatreGuillotine — execution machine consisting of a sharp blade which drops between a wooden frame to swiftly sever the headIn 1779, Dr Joseph Ignace Guillotin, a senior Parisian politician opposed to capital punishment, suggested to the French National Assembly that an execution machine which was fast and efficient would be more humane.A prototype was designed and the first victim (a highwayman) was beheaded in 1792.During the French Revolution between 1789-99, Guillotin became horrified that his name was associated with the device and petitioned the government to change its name. When this failed, his family changed their surname to escape the gruesome association.Sideburns — facial hair at the sides of the head, in front of the earWhile side whiskers have existed for centuries, sideburns got their name from the popular American general and politician Ambrose E. Burnside, who sported prominent mutton chops.This memorable style caught the public imagination and — despite his military failures during the Civil War in the 1860s — people soon referred it as \u0027burnsides\u0027.Over time the term was modified to sideburns — possibly because the hair concerned is on the side of the face.Maverick — someone who does things their own way          Samuel Augustus Maverick (pictured) was a lawyer and Texan landownerSamuel Augustus Maverick was a lawyer and Texan landowner, holding more than 385,000 acres. In 1845, he acquired 400 cattle as payment for a debt and Maverick, who had no ranching experience, took the unorthodox decision to leave the cattle unbranded and allowed them to wander across his vast estate. Unsurprisingly, when any strayed into another rancher\u0027s territory they were swiftly branded and claimed. Thus any unmarked cow became a \u0027Maverick\u0027. And maverick came to refer to a different way of doing things.Shrapnel — exploded fragments from the metal cases of artilleryHenry Shrapnel was a British Army officer who, in 1784, perfected the design for the exploding shell.           Henry Shrapnel (pictured) was a British Army officer who, in 1784, perfected the design for the exploding shellShrapnel thought he could make the cannon ball more deadly by filling a hollow shell with small metal balls, gunpowder and its own fuse. This would allow the shell to explode over the enemy.The Army adopted Shrapnel\u0027s invention in 1803 and it was used to devastating effect at Waterloo in 1815. Shrapnel shells were used until the beginning of World War II, when they were replaced by new highly explosive ammunition, sich as the Ordnance QF 25-Pounder. But \u0027shrapnel\u0027 was retained to describe the exploded metal from shell casings, which still wreak havoc on the battlefield.Diesel — a type of internal combustion engine a type of fuel          Rudolf Diesel (pictured) was a French–German engineer who invented the diesel engine in 1893Rudolf Diesel was a French–German engineer who invented the diesel engine in 1893.Compared to petrol engines, his compression-ignition design required much less fuel. The fuel, also cheaper to produce, became known as \u0027diesel\u0027 as well. Diesel did not live to see the huge success of his invention, which after World War I became the dominant engine in ships trucks and trains.Nicotine — the active ingredient in the leaf of the tobacco plant          Jean Nicot (pictured) was a French diplomat sent to Lisbon in 1557 to negotiate a marriageJean Nicot was a French diplomat sent to Lisbon in 1557 to negotiate a marriage between Margaret of Valois and King Sebastian I of Portugal. Although the trip was unsuccessful, he was introduced to the tobacco plant. Impressed, he sent seed samples to Catherine de Medici in France.Nicot instructed the queen how to crush the tobacco leaves into a powder, which could then be sniffed to cure ailments. The habit became popular at court before spreading across France.In 1753, Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus immortalised Nicot by naming a genus of tobacco \u0027cultivars Nicotiana\u0027. Later, in 1828 when the active ingredient in tobacco was first identified, it was given the name nicotine.          László Bíró (pictured)  became fed up with fountain pens leaking onto the pageBiro — ballpoint penHungarian László Bíró was a newspaper editor who became fed up with fountain pens leaking onto the page.He worked with his brother György and machinist Andor Goy to develop a ballpoint pen that controlled the flow of ink, and by 1931 Bíró developed a prototype.During World War II, the RAF ordered more than 30,000 ballpoint pens from Bíró because, unlike fountain pens, they did not leak at high altitude.          Charles Macintosh (pictured) invented waterproof fabricMackintosh — a long waterproof coatThe coat was named after the man who invented the fabric, Charles Macintosh.He was a Glasgow chemist who experimented with naphtha, a by-product of coal tar, and created a paste which could be sandwiched between two layers of fabric to make a waterproof material.Waterproof coats were smelly and some melted in hot weather. But in 1843 Macintosh developed a hardened melt-proof rubber (vulcanised) by heating it at high temperature to improve the finish.Hoover — to vacuum a vacuum cleaner          Janitor James Murray Spangler invented the first upright vacuum cleaner in 1908 to improve his asthmaJanitor James Murray Spangler invented the first upright vacuum cleaner in 1908 to improve his asthma with more efficient cleaning. But he struggled to market it to a wider public.U.S. leather goods manufacturer William Henry Hoover saw the potential and bought his patent.Offering customers a free ten-day trial proved highly effective and by 1922 the Hoover company was the largest vacuum-cleaner manufacturer in the world, to the extent that \u0027Hoovering\u0027 became synonymous with vacuuming.The Real McCoy And 149 Other Eponyms by Claire Cock-Starkey (The Bodleian Library, £9.99)."},{"url":null,"title":"Publicity hungry Prince Harry gazumped father Charles present Radio 4s Today show","story":"    The Prince of Wales said it was ‘amazing’ that Harry, above, had listened to him at all. Harry then invited his father to be one of his interviewees, along with former U.S. President Barack ObamaNow, though, his father magnanimously withdrew to avoid any conflict.Perhaps as a compromise, Harry then invited his father to be one of his interviewees, along with former U.S. President Barack Obama.The Prince took full advantage of the media platform given to his ‘darling boy’ (as he referred to Harry on air) with aplomb.Is it the end for William and Harry\u0027s \u0027double act\u0027?

as the Treasury was apparently keen to avoid headlines about it happening on Halloween.Among the measures set to be announced by Mr Hammond today are:A rescue package to salvage the Government\u0027s flagship Universal Credit welfare reformA £30billion upgrade for England\u0027s motorways and other major routes paid for by road taxFuel duty will be frozen for the ninth year in a row saving drivers and businesses millions of pounds Nearly a billion pounds extra for social care and £500million more for the Armed Forces following fury from Tory MPs about the threat of cuts to capabilitiesA £1.5billion bailout for the High Street that includes slashing business rates for independent retailersA £60million pledge to plant more trees to help preserve the country\u0027s environmentSome £160million for counter-terror policing amid claims Scotland Yard is struggling to keep pace with the threat from extremists Plans to move people trapped on \u0027payday loans\u0027 to zero-interest Government loansA review into whether marriage licensing rules should be relaxed so ceremonies can take place in pubs and outdoors.Mr Hammond is thought to have around £13billion more in the locker thanks to better-than-expected tax receipts, which could stave off the need for mooted tax hikes such as curbs on pension reliefs.But he is still facing a tough challenge as he spells out where he will find the £25billion extra promised to the NHS by 2023.He will confirm that the first stage of the NHS long-term plan will be to help achieve \u0027parity of esteem\u0027 between mental and physical health services.Mr Hammond is expected to argue that pumping £2billion a year into improving access to support will relieve pressure on other frontline services, such as the police that help people with mental health issues every day and sometimes have to use police station cells.The extra cash will help pay for the provision of round-the-clock \u0027comprehensive\u0027 mental health support in every major accident and emergency department, ensuring anyone experiencing a crisis can get rapid specialist help. Officials say it will be backed up with more mental health ambulances and the establishment of dedicated mental health teams in schools, linking them to other support services.Callers to NHS 111 will be directed to support services 24 hours a day and there will be greater access to services in the community, such as \u0027crisis cafes\u0027 where people can get help without going to A\u0026ampE.   Chancellor Philip Hammond takes a sip from a personalised Emma Bridgewater mug as he puts the finishing touches to his Budget last night           The Chancellor has been given some wriggle room with his deficit targets thanks to better-than-expected tax receiptsMr Hammond\u0027s wife Susan (left) was seen out walking their dogs near their London residence today.

Such a consequence included use against others in nuclear weapons.’Mr Attwater agreed to sign a basis of plea prior to his formal guilty plea, in which he said: ‘I did not know or believe that goods or aircraft components would be shipped to Iran.‘I did not think there was even the remotest opportunity of these good ending up in a nuclear weapons program.’George, of Bristol, denied two counts of being knowingly concerned in the supply or delivery of controlled goods to an embargoed destination but was found guilty by a jury. Mr Attwater, of Telford, Shropshire, admitted being knowingly concerned in the exportation of goods with intent to evade prohibition or restriction. Mrs Attwater, also of Telford, pleaded not guilty but was convicted of the charge.They were both sentenced to six months jail suspended for 12 months and barred from being company directors for the next six years.Proceedings against George’s wife, Ruth, 74, were dropped after it ruled she had no case to answer.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Time capsule haberdashery store dating 1920s","story":"    Walkers General Store, established in 1924, was known as a go to shop for groceries, sweets, china ornaments.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Halloween approaches and tiojo has been doing some appropriate reading:I’ve just put down Andrew Michael Hurley’s second novel based in the countryside of the Bowland Fells and the Fylde, Devil’s Day. It follows on well from his first, The Loney. The countryside, which I know well enough, inspires him. But he sees things in it not many of us would. What to us are rolling moors, green valleys, sparkling streams, picturesque farmsteads, signify something else to Mr Hurley. He sees another world. Spiritual, demonic, folkloric, who knows. An unsettling mixture of real and imagined geography gives us the horror version of Le Grande Meaulnes. His novels are psychogeography in action. The moors will look different next time I walk across them.On the same theme, Veufveuve has enjoyed Mary Shelley’s Transformation:A slim collection of short stories (comprising the title story, The Mortal Immortal, and The Evil Eye). All three stories are in some way supernatural or uncanny and the writing, though obviously touched by the gothic and thus sometimes a little overblown, is often very good – she knew what she was doing. All three stories, like Frankenstein, explore what it means to be human and how we might live. For me, by the far the most effective was The Mortal Immortal (I probably don’t need to explain the subject matter), bringing home its great existential crisis very powerfully.A different kind of monster has entertained Kevin Dawson in Craig Brown’s Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret:That rare thing, a genuinely unputdownablelaugh out loud book. Difficult to tell who was the less appealing, Princess Margaret herself or the people who (as Brown notes) happily accepted invites to events at which she would be present, knowing how awful it (and she) would be. They attended seemingly only so they could then skip off home to describe how awful the event was. Increased my respect for George Harrison, though (who, on being told he couldn’t eat before she left a “do” simply went up to her and asked her to leave).This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson has impressed 17Luftballons:It’s about the captain of the Beagle and Darwin. Echoes of Patrick O’Brian’s naval novels but it’s the detail and description that really bring it to life, so vivid and well-described I almost feel like I’m watching a film, or that I’ve visited all these places I’ve never seen. The characters are fascinatingly nuanced and human. And their debates over theology versus their scientific discoveries are really bringing home to me the significance and impact of evolutionary theory at the time. Nice and long, too - I don’t want it to end any time soon!A forensic and very readable analysis of The Iliad and the different strands that informed its creation. Utterly fascinating and totally recommended for armchair Homer fans and general readers alike.Here’s a teaser from casaleiro:About 10 days ago the  carried an interview with a Spanish writer who recommended A High Wind in Jamaica by Richard Hughes. Never heard of it! So down the town I went and found a copy in a charity shop. It was a fabulous discovery, and I am currently following it by re-reading William Golding’s Lord of the Flies. What the two have in common is their view of childhood as a wild and potentially violent state of being. I guess most readers are familiar with Golding. Concerning the older novel by Hughes (1929), I will say nothing, I simply urge people to read it, preferably without knowing anything about it beforehand.I’m intrigued. Talking of suspense, franhunny has been reading Agatha Christie’s Mrs McGinty’s Dead:While I usually loathe Poirot because of his smugness, it was not as bad as in other Poirot novels so I could live with it as a quirk.Which made the book quite enjoyable. Oh, I knew the murderer after the second murder, but I did not know why yet and how the two murders were connected.A classic whodunnit, with the classic “all suspects into the same room” finale where Mr Poirot explains his thoughts.A few hours well spent.(I’m glad it felt like a good investment of time, because we’re going to be looking at Agatha Christie on the reading group next month.)Finally, Tropic of Capricorn by Henry Miller has done the trick for judgeDAmNationIII:I’m about halfway through rereading and my God is it the tonic I need at the moment. I remember being relatively unimpressed with it the first time around (at least compared to the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy and Black Spring, which I read first), and although there are parts that go on a bit, the rest of it just feels like it’s screaming directly into my soul.That sounds pretty good to me.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

It is no good outsiders pouring contempt on Jair Bolsonaro, victor in Sunday’s Brazilian presidential election. He is the choice of his people. For non-Brazilians, it is what he represents, not what he says, that matters.Brazil has been one of the world’s most exciting emergent nations, yet its evolution over 30 years from dictatorship to hesitant democracy seems to have stalled. Bolsonaro has exploited the oldest politics, that of self-interest, and also the newest, that of anger, polarisation and fear. Voters have stomached his distaste for gay people, feminism, rainforests and the rule of law, to rid themselves of a corrupt leftwing regime unable to contain street violence. A famously tolerant nation has opted for military and economic discipline.In any country, the apparent breakdown of social order will drive voters to extremism. This message has proved popular around the world, from Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, Viktor Orbán of Hungary, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey, even America’s Donald Trump. Liberal values, however defined, will not survive when their defenders cannot transmit their virtues to voters.The lesson for champions of open democracy is glaring. Its values cannot be taken for granted. When debate is no longer through regulated media, courts and institutions, politics will default to the mob. Social media – once hailed as an agent of global concord – has become the purveyor of falsity, anger and hatred. Its algorithms polarise opinion. Its pseudo-information drives argument to the extremes. Even an apparently stable democracy such as Germany this week finds its centrist consensus torn apart, as the electorate ides between far right and radical left.Born in Glicério in São Paulo in 1955 to parents of Italian descent, he served in the army from 1971 until 1988, when he was elected as a city councillor in Rio de Janeiro for the Christian Democratic party. In 1990, he became a federal congressman for the same party. He has since been affiliated with a number of political parties. On 22 July, he was officially nominated as the presidential candidate of the Social Liberal party.Bolsonaro espouses populist and nationalist views that often stray into far-right territory.\u0026nbsp A vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, abortion, immigration and other progressive causes, he has defended the death penalty and the 1964-85 military dictatorship. On foreign policy, he has said he wants to improve relations with the US. Economically he says he is pro free market and privatisation.\u0026nbspDeliberately provocative and polarising. He has praised Gen Pinochet, expressed support for torturers and called for political opponents to be shot, earning him\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsplabel\u0026nbspof the most misogynistic, hateful elected official in the democratic world”.\u0026nbsp In his bid to capitalise on Latin America’s lurch to the right, he paints himself as a tropical Donald Trump: a pro-gun, anti-establishment crusader set on draining the swamp and cracking down on violent crime.On top of repeated calls for a return to dictatorship, he has made equally inflammatory attacks on\u0026nbspwomen,\u0026nbspblack people,\u0026nbspgay people, foreigners and indigenous communities. Earlier this year,\u0026nbsphe was charged by the attorney general with inciting hate speech.\u0026nbspEvery continent is now seeing the emergence of (mostly) rightwing disrupters. They appeal to those who feel excluded by “identity politics”, by what they perceive as liberal pandering to minorities. They feed on religious intolerance and on neighbourhood insecurity. They spit anger at any form of establishment. Yapping in their van are the jackals of social media, spreading fear.In the light of the rise of the new right, it is not enough for liberals to stay silent. Lies and hatred cannot be purveyed across the globe for profit. Hysteria and anger cannot become standard political discourse. The boring modalities of democracy – regulating elections, curbing censorship, taming extremism, fighting corruption – all matter crucially.Democratic leadership is becoming inured to moderation. Britain is no exception. What should be a sensible debate over trade policy has become polarised and polluted with anger. Coalition and compromise appear impossible. The outcome could yet be disastrous. That is the message of Brazil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3280367acefe2fbce3b3e53491ccdfeddbd5170c/567_152_4627_2776/master/4627.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1a5fc211f9d6d75182dc2b3dbf610c2","title":"brexit 50p curerency vote remain chancellor commemorative coin","story":"The chancellor’s proposed commemorative piece neglects remainers – so I’ve coined five ideasPhilip Hammond’s proposed commemorative Brexit 50p coin is a stone-cold work of art. I mean it. It’s a silly distraction. It’s a medal designed to honour a false sense of misplaced national entitlement. It’s a tangible object that you can watch plummet in global value in real time. Honestly, it’s a masterpiece of form and content. You couldn’t do better if you tried.According to the Sun, the Brexit 50p will read “Friendship with all nations”. And that’s fine, if a subtle reminder that sarcasm doesn’t always translate to currency. But you know what would be better? Coins that came etched with different phrases in various European languages. Maybe (and attentive readers will note my use of Google Translate) Ich habe definitiv für rest entschieden (I definitely voted remain, in German), or Nous ne sommes pas tous comme eux (We’re not all like them, in French), or perhaps Jeg kan passe ind i en kuffert, tag mig med dig, tak, jeg vil ikke have et blåt pas (I can fit into a suitcase, take me with you, thank you, I don’t want a blue passport, in Danish).Hammond’s 50p is traditional in that it has the Queen on one side and something else on the other. But this doesn’t fully reflect the sensation of living in post-Brexit Britain, so how about a coin that has the Queen on both sides? Something like that would be perfect for anyone in your life who enjoys making decisions based on the toss of a coin. Examples of Brexit-adjacent decisions you make with the two-headed coin include: Heads I shave off my eyebrows tails I don’t, Heads I set everything I own on fire tails I order a pizza, and Heads I destroy the welfare of every subsequent generation tails I go and have a nice cup of tea.I don’t know how the technology of this would work, but I’d really like to see a coin that mimics the Queen’s actual reaction to Brexit on a minute-by-minute basis. A coin where she slaps her forehead whenever Theresa May leaves the room. A coin with eyes that boggle whenever Britain’s circle of influence is further diminished. A coin that visibly lurches in despair when it realises that the subjects are close to revolt. That would be fun, right?That’s what you really want, isn’t it? Leaving the European Union isn’t enough for you, is it? You preferred the country before it was ravaged by the scourge of decimalisation, didn’t you? Well, fine. To prove we’re not sore losers let’s mint a commemorative Brexit farthing. Look how beautiful it is the size of a literal dinner plate, made of contaminated lead and worth a genuinely obscure fraction of a pound. Not enough? Fine. Then, let’s bring back the barter system. Here’s a commemorative Brexit bag of apples. A commemorative Brexit pig. Happy now?You definitely grabbed a handful of these coins when you left your house this morning. You chose them because they were the best coins and met your needs much better than any of the other coins. But now you’re at the newsagent trying to buy a Twix and you can’t find them.

You are delivering your annual statement to the principal shareholders, many of whom think it would be a good idea to get out of the way of the whirlwind. Others, mysteriously, dismiss the strong advice of “expert” meteorologists and insist that the hurricane will somehow be good for the business, liberating its full potential as it tears the building from its very foundations. Yet another group – the Jeremy and John Consortium – thinks that the battering storm will enable them to transform the business and collectivise its assets.This is pretty much what it will be like for Philip Hammond when he stands up on Monday to deliver his third budget, the last before Hurricane Brexit hits the United Kingdom on 29 March. By definition, the chancellor of the day is always the cabinet’s party-pooper, the minister whose task it is to contain the spending ambitions of his departmental colleagues.But there is a special loathing reserved for Hammond. Many of his fellow cabinet ministers seethe about him in private with a ferocity that is simply not warranted by his love of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and aversion to political showboating. No: senior Tories hate Hammond because he challenges their magical thinking about Brexit, their faith that our departure from the EU will be a triumph of the will if we dare to embrace the power of positive thinking. Tediously, laboriously, but entirely correctly, the chancellor maintains that bravado and conviction have nothing to do with it: Brexit will be a highly technical, operational matter, not an exercise in pageantry and rightwing performance art.Still, he is obliged, ex officio, not to panic and to deliver a budget that as far as possible cleaves to the rules of normal service. As ever, a series of measures has been heavily trailed before his speech: additional defence spending, a fresh box of sticking plasters for universal credit, help for rough sleepers, money for broadband, a boost for the UK’s beleaguered high streets, an extra £420m for potholes and – pure bathos – the announcement of a review to enable couples to be married in the open air. Next Conservative slogan: Britain Just Got Wetter.There has also been speculation that the chancellor will raise income tax thresholds in 2019 – a year earlier than planned. That would certainly be consistent with the fiscal strategy adopted by the Conservatives since the formation of the Cameron-Clegg coalition eight years ago. But it would sit uneasily alongside Theresa May’s promise in her party conference speech that austerity “is over”.Hammond might argue, with much evidence on his side, that revenues increase when tax thresholds rise and rates fall. But this is a very difficult argument to make politically at a time when so many are feeling the full impact of eight years of cuts – with more to come.From Hammond’s interview on Sunday with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, it was clear that the chancellor wants to postpone as many serious decisions as possible until next year’s spending review. Who can blame him? For better or worse, the moment of departure from the EU will be in the rearview mirror: whoever is chancellor will at least have the measure of what is happening, and a sense of the depth of the economic craters (or the height of the sunlit uplands if, against all logic, the Brexiteers prove to be right).As for this budget, Hammond cannot even be sure that it will get through the Commons. The Democratic Unionist party, whose 10 MPs prop up this minority government, have been explicit in their warning that they may vote against the finance bill if they are unsatisfied by May’s negotiating position on the Irish border. This would be, to use the cliche, a nuclear option. But we are living in one of those phases in politics where cliches regain their original force. It is now more than conceivable that the DUP, perhaps in alliance with a few hard Brexiteer Tory MPs, could vote down the budget.So shrunken and petty does politics seem these days that it is easy to neglect the scale of what is at stake. Even as we approach the greatest single change in our institutional and commercial arrangements since the second world war, there is a parallel ideological conflict over the very nature of the state and citizenship. Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell want a very different system, with nationalisation and Keynesian borrowing, taxation and expenditure at its heart. The Conservatives still stand for fiscal conservatism, moderated to a greater or lesser extent by the occasional spree.This is indeed an important and necessary debate: the role of the state in the 21st century will certainly change as automation means that there is less work for us to do as we live longer, and as the inequalities of globalisation become ever more intolerable. Yet our political class, as presently configured, is not up to the task of this dual conversation: it is seriously overstretched, tested way past its enfeebled civic capacity. There is terrible weakness on both sides of the dispatch box.Yes, Labour is (up to a point) defining the battle of ideas, but – to judge, at least, by the opinion polls – it is nowhere near where it needs to be electorally. The Tory minority government could be accused of playground politics – though that would be grossly unfair to the children in most playgrounds. The system is dangerously close to overload. Hammond will doubtless be as smooth as ever. But all around him will fizz and fly the sparks of a political circuitry that may soon be ablaze."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10effa7dfc99ebc3aea29e1072a7e03ba46f5ef9/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5be87c0798f1d3827ff6980f93dfc0a6","title":"northern irish voters theresa may dup arlene foster brexit","story":"The Democratic Unionist party is defined by its hostility to the Republic of Ireland. For the DUP the political crisis of Brexit has generated a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take back control of Northern Ireland. It seems that it will do this even if it entails destroying the Good Friday agreement and defying the wishes of a substantial majority of its own electorate.This is evident from the remarks of the party’s leader, Arlene Foster, on the fringe of the Tory party conference this month. The 1998 agreement is not “sacrosanct”, she said, and “could evolve” into something different in the context of the UK’s departure from the EU. Foster also told a sympathetic newspaper how it was “deeply frustrating to hear people who voted remain and in Europe talk about Northern Ireland as though we can’t touch the Belfast agreement”.Earlier in the year the party had sought to use its leverage in the Commons to rework legislation which the responsible minister said was “a cornerstone of the Belfast agreement”.None of this should be in the least surprising. The current leaders of the party founded by Ian Paisley are defined by the break he made with mainstream unionism over the Good Friday agreement – it is the DUP’s main calling card, the reason it has successfully crushed the rest of political unionism. Under its “leadership” the devolved structures of government created by that agreement have ground to a halt. And to make matters worse various cross-border initiatives, both fostered by and developed since it came into effect, are now threatened by the hardest of hard borders that the DUP’s Brexit fanatics at Westminster (a cult within a cult) seem determined to embrace. The electoral lottery has awarded the DUP a potential prize it seems determined to claim. Ireland’s defeat is their victory even if, as with Shelley’s Ozymandias, “nothing beside remains”.It has been reported that Theresa May refuses to meet with Northern Ireland’s non-unionist political representatives as a group. The four political parties that requested a joint meeting – Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the Alliance, and the Green party – represent a remain opinion in Northern Ireland that delivered a strong vote for the EU in the 2016 referendum.Northern Ireland business agrees: local CBI chair Trevor Lockhart recently wrote to May on behalf of 21 signatory organisations warning of the grave concern felt by business at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, now coming much more plausibly into view in light of the refusal of any compromise on the Irish backstop – a position rendered intractable by DUP intransigence. Lockhart, who admits that he may himself have to move his business south to the Republic of Ireland, is clear that (as he told the Financial Times) the concerns felt by business are “cross-sectoral and … cross-community”. That point is further attested to by opinion polling in the province published by Queen’s University Belfast in July.With its opposition to Brexit combining with its views on the rights of women, gay people and much else, the DUP undoubtedly presents to many in Britain as an absurd throwback to a nasty time of sectarian politics and evangelical reaction. Views towards it in the Republic of Ireland are probably the same indeed the state has liberated itself from a conservative Catholic dominance whose social policy priorities are now to be found (irony of ironies) only within the ranks of the Rome-hating DUP. It cannot be stated often enough that this is also how the DUP present to very many in Northern Ireland as well, perhaps (as the numbers above indicate) even a majority.It was the 17th-century Protestant preacher Thomas Fuller who seems to have been the first to say that “the darkest hour is just before the dawn”. It has been so in the Republic, where reaction to a series of awful events and discoveries about the past helped propel the country to its brighter present. Brexit has pushed the non-unionist parties into important progressive alliances: on business, the border and rights (the last of these especially vulnerable after Brexit). Might the crisis of Brexit be about to present Northern Ireland with a chance to transcend the ancient green-orange ide?May should meet with the Northern Ireland remain parties with more votes than their DUP opponents, and throw in Lockhart and Swann for good measure. It will at very least make a change from dreary exchanges of red lines with the 10 DUP MPs to which she is beholden. And she might even be able to spot a nascent Northern Ireland in the making: one that is warmer, more tolerant and connected to the wishes of its people than its supposed representatives.• Conor Gearty is professor of human rights law at the LSE, and a fellow of the British Academy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f8fca827d6217595e40c3ec4a559b6bffa1d261/1_0_3046_1828/master/3046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f013f0b149f8d619c63ca03b56b0fd79","title":"peterloo britain kings queens mike leigh massacre","story":"Mike Leigh is right to call the massacre a ‘major, major event’ – it can teach us much about our country todayThe words are those of Samuel Bamford, the weaver, writer and advocate of universal suffrage who in August 1819 witnessed first-hand what history came to know as the Peterloo massacre. The site in central Manchester where it happened, known back then as St Peter’s Field, is marked by a plaque on the wall of what was once the Free Trade Hall but is now the city’s Radisson hotel, a luxurious flophouse I mostly associate with hordes of boozing delegates at modern political party conferences. How many passersby ever look up at that tiny red circle and think about the awful day when “a peaceful rally of 60,000 pro-democracy reformers, men, women and children, was attacked by armed cavalry resulting in 15 deaths and over 600 injuries”?The massacre’s imminent 200th anniversary is already being marked by a piece of art that restores not just Peterloo’s flesh, blood and raw passions, but a vivid sense of what it says about the country where it happened, both then and now. Mike Leigh’s film Peterloo, released this Friday, is two and a half hours long and clearly a labour of love. It’s a little too heavy on clunky dialogue that makes even minor asides sound like political speeches, and so determined to cover the breadth of its story that it loses any real sense of human intimacy. But thanks to its depiction of a time of revolution, war and economic depression, its evocation of Manchester at the start of the Industrial Revolution, and its amazing staging of the massacre itself, what it says most plainly is undeniable: this mattered.In the buildup to the film’s release, there have been one or two rumblings to the contrary. In a column written for the Times in August, the writer and Conservative peer Daniel Finkelstein responded to Leigh’s insistence that Peterloo was “a major, major event” and ought to be a compulsory part of the national curriculum. Peterloo, said Finkelstein, “was not the beginning of anything much”. Britain’s modern history, moreover, “was shaped in factories and parliament and not on the street”. He went on: “Mike Leigh is arguing that because all pupils are taught about 1066, the Magna Carta, the wives of Henry VIII, the French Revolution and Waterloo they should all learn about Peterloo. And this equivalence is simply wrong.”I am not a huge fan of columns about other columns, but this deserves a response. Whether this country’s slow and fitful embrace of democracy originated in “the street” is a moot point, but it certainly happened thanks to the pressure exerted by an ever more engaged population, and developments that occurred far away from centres of power. People’s demands for a meaningful political voice stretched back to the great sprouting of radical and deeply egalitarian thinking that happened in and around the English civil war, and on to the ferment on this side of the channel that took root in the wake of the French Revolution: reform societies and political unions, ever-larger outdoor meetings, the large readerships that feasted on Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man and William Cobbett’s weekly Political Register.In that sense, Peterloo – the name, first written as “Peter-Loo”, was coined by the editor of a weekly paper called the Manchester Observer – does not demand attention solely because of what happened on one day, but because of a much longer story that fed into the events of 16 August 1819, and then extended beyond them.The foundation of this newspaper– then called the Manchester , and established in the aftermath of Peterloo to “warmly advocate the cause of Reform” – is part of this story. Chartism flared to life 15 years later. Trade unions eventually began to break through in the 1850s the expansion of the electorate was marked by the passage of legislation in 1832, 1867, 1884, 1918 and 1928.These changes may have happened at a glacial pace, but not so slowly that we can’t look beyond their datelines and identify events that set the stage: the huge meetings that happened in 1816 at Spa Fields in north London, and teetered into riots the “reform riots” of 1831 in Bristol, Nottingham and Derby, and demonstrations around the same time in London and Birmingham the huge Chartist gatherings at Kersal Moor, in Salford, in 1838 and 1839 the latter year’s Newport Rising.These things form a kind of shadow history of 19th-century Britain, which still has far too little purchase on this country’s shared sense of its past. Peterloo was pre-eminent among them, not least because it confirmed that reformers had an unanswerable moral case, while the authorities were exposed as the defenders of brute privilege. There is, moreover, another chronically overlooked aspect of the way August 1819 opened a path to the future: the fact that in the period leading up to the massacre, women’s reform societies had sprung up around the north-west, formed to support the fight for male suffrage, but also responsible for the innovation of women voting alongside men at radical gatherings. They attracted no end of abuse, but women reformers were defiantly on the platform at St Peter’s Field. In a just-published book about the massacre, the historical writer Jacqueline Riding says that what they did represented “the earliest example of organised female activity in British politics”.Peterloo also shines unflattering light on some of our laziest national myths. Over the past 15 years or so, we have got used to politicians describing Britain – or England – as a country that has always exuded “decency, tolerance and a sense of fair play”. By contrast, Thompson saw 1819’s carnage originating in “the panic of class hatred” and an ingrained belief that any working class crowd was always only a breath away from turning into the mob – something that has regularly surfaced long into the democratic age: witness Orgreave or Hillsborough. Another point, even more overlooked, is bound up with the same tendency of authority to tip into brutality: the fact that Peterloo saw the violence meted out by British colonialists unexpectedly returning home, and pointed ahead to some of the empire’s bloodiest episodes.One other lesson runs through Peterloo and its legacy: the ruling class is not some phantasm of lefty demonology, but a real thing – and, even in the 21st century, its most essential features remain. Its leading lights are still hopelessly stubborn and attached to the glories of fighting the last war. As evidenced by a long story that takes in everything from the poverty of the 1930s to the Conservative party’s birthing and the bungling of Brexit, they must always get things horribly wrong before they are close to getting them even half right.Watching Leigh’s film, there was a moment when some minor character was voicing reactionary opinions with florid humbug, and I instantly pictured the former foreign secretary these days trying to sell us some half-cocked vision of our national destiny. Boris Johnson, in fact, is a creature seemingly plucked from a cartoon by the Georgian artist George Cruikshank – and a man whose infamous purchase of German water cannon while he was the mayor of London highlighted a fear of the mob that any student of the 19th century would recognise instantly.The kind of history that now seems to dominate our culture is too often centred on kings, queens and powerful men, something lately seen in the revival of the cult of Winston Churchill. Peterloo and everything that followed it were the products of things that were much more profound: disjunctions between systems of power and the new industrial economy, and the fact that among the first people to live out those contradictions and demand their resolution were the thousands who gathered in St Peter’s Field.Put another way, this country’s journey into democracy was a product of the wisdom of crowds. There, not in ministries and mansions, is where social progress always originates, and in times as uncertain as ours, we would do well to remember it.• This article was amended on 29 October 2018.

What is the clue? We catch him doing a crossword at the wheel of his Saab 900 convertible.“Solve-driving” is not a term we have needed in our real world … until this week, when a motorcyclist’s helmet-camera apparently caught a driver in Lancashire attending to a puzzle at the wheel of his BMW 520.Now, any setter reading the above will not be thinking “He did what?”, or even “I wonder whether this addictive puzzle was one of mine?”, but: “Saab … great letters ... less so, BMW.” Car brands and marques are often short words which can be manipulated into others. Here are the ones that cryptic solvers need to bear in mind.Two reminders to the wary. In the example clues below, I will explain the two parts of each: the definition of the answer, given in bold type, and the wordplay – the recipe for assembling its letters. In a genuine puzzle environment, you also have the crossing letters, which massively alleviate your solving load. Secondly, the explanations contain links to previous entries in this series on such matters as spelling one word backward to reveal another. Setters’ names tend to link to interviews, in case you feel like getting to know these people better.The cars which bear the name of Charles Rolls and Henry Royce are often abbreviated to “RR”, so the word “car” in a clue might only indicate two letters of its answer, both of them R. Here is Puck …… who is looking for CORRIE.Fifteen million sold, and it can be referred to using a single letter? The Model T Ford is irresistible to setters. The word “model” might mean that there is an anagram coming, or it might just as much want you to replace it with a T, as in Auracaria’s clue …… for EVENT.A setter could indicate that the car they have in mind is a Volkswagen by using a phrase such as “car firm fined €1bn over diesel-emissions cheating”, but that’s not so much fun, is it?So another pair of letters that you might need to substitute for “car” are V and W, as in Brendan’s clue …… for AVOW, second only to AVER in crossword setters’ favourite terms for “saying something”.When they bought MG in 2007, Nanjing Automobile hoped that the letters could be reimagined as standing for “Modern Gentleman”. Happily, no one was interested. Once upon a time, MG meant “Morris Garages”, after the charming William Morris, but now it’s really just a letter pair, as in Gordius’s clue …… for the Greek letter SIGMA, of which more here (likewise ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA and the rest).… if anyone can explain to me the appeal to car manufacturers of four-letter, vowel-heavy names, I would be grateful. In the meantime, we all need to keep this lot in mind too, especially for longer answers.Seasoned solvers: what have I missed (and do you have any of your own devising)?

This is inexcusable – every child should be able to breathe clean air so they can grow and fulfil their potential.”The findings coincide with the start of the first global conference on air pollution and health in Geneva, including a high-level action day at which nations and cities are expected to make new commitments to cut air pollution.The WHO study found that children are particularly vulnerable to air pollution because pollutants are often more concentrated nearer to ground level. It added that their developing organs and nervous system are also more susceptible to long-term damage than those of adults.“Air pollution is stunting our children’s brains, affecting their health in more ways than we suspected,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO director of public health and the environment.Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable, with dirty air linked to premature and underweight children. Air pollution also increases the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease later in life.Tedros, writing in the  on Saturday, described air pollution as the “new tobacco”, saying the simple act of breathing is killing 7 million people a year and harming billions more.In the UK, most urban areas have illegal levels of air pollution and ministers have lost three times in the high court after challenges over the inadequacy of their action. The latest government action plan, called “pitiful” by environmental lawyers, revealed air pollution was actually much worse than previously feared.Globally, with smoking on the decline, air pollution now causes more deaths annually than tobacco. However, researchers think the harm known to be caused by air pollution, such as heart attacks and lung disease, is only “the tip of the iceberg”.Today’s report found that both indoor and outdoor air pollution was causing significant health problems. It said burning fuel such as wood or paraffin for heating, cooking and light in poorer countries was having a drastic impact on children’s health and called on governments to promote the clean alternatives as a matter of urgency.Mark Watts, executive director of the C40 Cities group, which represents cities around the world working to tackle the climate crisis and air pollution, said the report was an urgent call to action.“The moral and practical case for urgent, bold and far-reaching action to reduce emissions, including calling an end to the fossil fuel era, is now utterly irrefutable,” he said.“Citizens are demanding action to protect their children, mayors of the world’s big cities are regulating to take dirty vehicles off the streets and slash emissions from buildings and waste. Now is the moment for governments, car manufacturers and other big polluters to step up.”Neira said the air pollution crisis and the climate emergency could only be tackled together.“The solutions are a basic public health agenda that will have plenty of benefits for public health and the environment,” she said. “No matter what else, we know that we need to decarbonise our society sooner rather than later and the benefits of that for our health and our economy are indisputable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/662ce2118e6e3e07d4eb5156b6d4099a8ad5e11a/0_106_1425_854/master/1425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3773d0e4b9a248f65840049ba5c0aed3","title":"unfashionably fashionable the best of rankin in pictures","story":"A new book charts 30 years of the fashion photographer’s work.

She was due to meet the Queen and asked the French designer to make an evening dress for the occasion. Deneuve arrived at his Paris studio with a photograph of a Russian model wearing a gown that she liked from the previous year.“He agreed to make it for me … it was very Slavic, pure and strict.” Afterwards she proposed he design her costumes for the film Belle de Jour. Saint Laurent dressed Deneuve for 40 years. He died in 2008.“The piercing seriousness of Yves Saint Laurent during the fittings and his shy grace in life have charmed all the years we have passed together,” Deneuve said. “I was just 20 years old and so it was a privilege to have access to all this voluptuous luxury, to train my eye and my tastes at his side.”Christie’s France president, François de Ricqlès, told Agence France-Presse the sale brought together “one of the most famous French actors and one of the most illustrious French designers”.The collection includes coats, suits, dresses and accessories, many of them one-off pieces.

Preheat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with baking paper.Cook the coconut, brown sugar, granulated sugar and egg whites in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly, just until the sugars have melted. If the mixture is too runny to shape by the spoonful, add more coconut.Using 2 soup spoons, drop heaped tablespoonfuls of the coconut mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 5cm apart. They do not have to be perfect, but try to make them about the same size.Bake until the coconut mounds are golden brown, 18-20 minutes. Let stand on the baking sheets until completely cool.Bring about 2.5cm of water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Turn the heat to low so the water is barely simmering. Place a glass or metal bowl over the pan. Coarsely chop the chocolate and put in the bowl. Let the chocolate melt, stirring occasionally, until it is almost, but not completely, melted. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and let the chocolate stand, stirring often, until fully melted and slightly cooled and thickened.The bottom of the bowl shouldn’t touch the simmering water as the chocolate melts. If the chocolate gets too hot, it can become grainy.One at a time, dip the bottom of each cookie into the chocolate, just so the chocolate comes about 3mm up the sides of the cookie. Transfer the cookies to a plate, chocolate side up. Before the chocolate sets, sprinkle with the salt. Refrigerate the cookies until the chocolate hardens, about 15 minutes, then turn them upright and cover with clingfilm or transfer to a covered container. Store in the refrigerator, but serve at room temperature.Sprinkle chopped nuts, ground freeze-dried berries or extra desiccated coconut over the chocolate just after dipping them in the melted chocolate, if you like.From Downtime by Nadine Levy Redzepi (Ebury Press, £27)These “tiles” require a bit of fussing to make, and are fragile to boot, but they are so elegant and delicious as to merit the trouble. I caution you to set up your cooling operation in a no-traffic zone – I once spent hours baking more than a hundred tuiles for a charity dinner. Every whack of a cleaver, every footstep, sent some of the fragile tiles to the floor. We christened the replacement batch “floor tiles” because we opted to leave them flat. This sensible alternative tastes the same and precludes calamity.For about 28salted butter 2 tbsp caster sugar 55g sliced almonds 70g plain flour 2 tbsp egg whites 60ml (1-2) salt ⅛ tspPreheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6. Set a mixing bowl near or on the oven to warm through.Melt the butter in a pan over low heat, and monitor it as it turns a pale hazelnut colour and releases its nutty fragrance. Promptly pour into the warm mixing bowl. Add the sugar, almonds, flour and egg whites, and stir and fold gently to combine. Don’t beat. Add the salt and taste. It should taste salty-sweet. The batter will be viscous, ropey and glossy.Spoon 1 heaped teaspoonful of the batter onto a nonstick cookie sheet and use a fork to spread it into a rough 7.5cm circle, barely thicker than a slice of almond. Try to scoop about half almonds, half batter for each tuile, and dip the fork into a glass of water between efforts, to keep it from “grabbing” the batter as you spread it into translucent puddles. The batter will spread a little more as it bakes, so leave 2.5cm between each puddle. You can fit about 9 tuiles on a 35cm-square baking sheet.Bake until the cookies are mottled golden in the centre and tea coloured on the edges, about 3-5 minutes. Because many ovens don’t bake evenly, the cookies may not either. Watch and either rotate the cookie sheet to correct for this or remove any tuiles that brown much more quickly than the rest.Pull the sheet from the oven and immediately transfer the tuiles one by one to the chosen cooling spot with a thin-bladed metal spatula. If the cookies start to stick before you get them all off the sheet, you need only return it to the oven for long enough to remelt the caramelised sugar, then peel them off while they are still pliable. Wipe the baking sheet clean between batches. (To speed up production, you may want to use two sheets, spreading the batter on the second one while the first set of cookies bakes.)The caramelised sugar will readily grab humidity out of the air, which could quickly soften the cookies and collapse their curves, so as soon as they are cool, place the tuiles, cantilevered like roof tiles, in an airtight container.NOTE If you don’t have a nonstick baking sheet, use a heavy-gauge regular sheet, brushed with clarified unsalted butter.

As an alternative to custard powder, you could use cornflour. It won’t have the wonderful old-school yellow of custard powder but the yo-yos will still taste great: you might just want to up the amount of vanilla extract you use. And if you’re not opposed to food colouring, a drop or two of yellow will also help to simulate the colour of the custard.The icing can be made up to two days in advance and kept in the fridge. The dough tends to go very hard if left in the fridge, so it is best to roll them on the day the dough is made.Makes 15plain flour 175g, plus 1 tbsp extra for dustingcustard powder 65g (or cornflour)icing sugar 65g salt ⅛ tsp unsalted butter 170g, at room temperature, cubedvanilla extract ¼ tsp (or ½ tsp, if using cornflour)For the rhubarb icingrhubarb 1 small stick (70g), trimmed, washed and cut into roughly 3cm lengths unsalted butter 65g, at room temperature, cubedicing sugar 130g lemon juice ½ tspPreheat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Line a small baking tray with baking parchment.To make the rhubarb icing, spread the rhubarb out on the lined baking tray and roast for 30 minutes, or until softened. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before transferring to the bowl of a food processor. Blitz to a puree, then add the butter. Sift in the icing sugar, add the lemon juice and continue to process for a couple of minutes: it seems like a long time, but you want it to thicken, which it will do as it’s whipped. Transfer to a small bowl and chill in the fridge for a couple of hours to firm up. You don’t want the icing to be at all runny, so add a little more icing sugar if necessary: it needs to hold when sandwiched between the biscuits.To make the dough, sift the flour, custard powder, icing sugar and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Mix on a low speed to combine. Add the butter and continue to mix on a low speed until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to medium and beat for about 30 seconds, until the dough comes together.Reduce the oven temperature to 170Cgas mark 3. Line two baking trays with parchment paper.Pinch off small bits of dough and use your hands to roll them into 3cm round balls: you should have enough dough for 30 balls, about 15g each. Place them on the lined baking trays, spaced about 4cm apart. Dip the back prongs of a small fork in the remaining flour before gently but firmly pressing down into the middle of each biscuit: the balls will increase to about 3.5cm wide, but don’t press all the way to the bottom you just want to create firm lines in the dough rather than force them to spread out.Bake for 25 minutes, rotating the trays halfway through, until the biscuits are dry on the bottom but have not taken on too much colour. They will be relatively fragile when warm but still firm to the touch. Set aside on the trays to cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.To assemble, sandwich pairs of biscuits together with the icing, with the “forked” sides facing outwards. You should use about 15g of icing in each biscuit. It will seem like a lot, but trust us – the biscuits can take it.Once assembled, the yo-yos can be kept for up to 5 days in an airtight container, so long as they are not anywhere too warm (in which case the icing will soften).From Sweet by Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh (Ebury Press, £27)At Violet, we use an ice-cream scoop to portion the cookies perfectly, but at home you can use two dessertspoons.Makes 16 large cookiesunsalted butter 250g, softenedlight brown sugar 200g caster sugar 100g vanilla ½ tsp egg yolks 3 plain flour 325g fine sea salt 1¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda ¾ tsp dark chocolate chips 250g, or broken-up bar of your favourite chocolateLine a small baking tray or baking tin (one that will fit inside your freezer) with parchment paper.Beat the butter and sugars in the bowl of an electric mixer until combined but not too creamy – you are not aiming for light and fluffy here, as that would make the cookies too cakey. Add the vanilla and the egg yolks and mix well.In another bowl weigh out the flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda and whisk together well. Add this to the butter and egg mixture along with the chocolate, and mix until combined.Scoop inidual portions of cookie dough on to the lined baking tray or tin. If using spoons, pat each portion into a little ball. Cover with clingfilm and freeze for at least 1 hour, or up to a month. If you are pushed for time, or simply impatient, you can bake them straightaway, but the cookies will be slightly flatter and less even than the ones here.When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Line a large baking tray or tin with parchment paper and arrange the cookies evenly on the tray, leaving enough space between each one so they have room to expand during baking (when they will almost double in size). If you are baking from frozen, allow the cookies 5-10 minutes out of the freezer before placing in the oven.Bake for 18 minutes, until the centre of each cookie is slightly soft and underbaked but the edges are crispy and golden. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the tray for 10 minutes before serving.These cookies will keep for up to 5 days in an airtight container.From The Violet Bakery Cookbook by Claire Ptak (Square Peg, £20)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8d830b806f6ef65c3dd37d81c6a6bb21eeaf67f/0_3377_5683_3410/master/5683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=912b8f01096befdb128e8f698daca8c6","title":"thomasina miers breaded sardines apple kohlrabi salad recipe","story":"Make the most of this season’s apples with this simple light lunch or supperIn September, I ate my first ribston pippin – the most delicious apple variety I have tasted in a long time.

In an interview with France Football he was damning of Pérez.“He only ever looked at me as a business relationship,” he said. “I know it. What he told me never came from the heart.”The club has claimed Ronaldo’s transfer was instigated “at the will and the request of the player”. The Portugal international suggested Pérez’s attitude towards him had changed.“I felt it inside the club, especially from the president, that they no longer considered me the same way that they did in the start,” he said. “In the first four or five years there, I had the feeling of being ‘Cristiano Ronaldo’. Less afterwards. The president looked at me through eyes that didn’t want to say the same thing, as if I was no longer indispensable to them, if you know what I mean.Asked whether the manager Zinedine Zidane’s decision to leave after overseeing a third successive European Cup win had influenced his move, Ronaldo said: “My decision to leave was not based on his departure. That being the case, it’s one of those little things that made me feel a bit better in terms of what I thought of the situation at the club.”The 33-year-old, who scored 44 goals for Madrid last season and has seven for Juventus, is aiming to win the Ballon d’Or for a third year in a row. “I think I deserve it this year … Yes, I dream of winning the Ballon d’Or for the sixth time and passing, in this case, Lionel Messi.”Ronaldo is the subject of a criminal investigation by Las Vegas police and a separate civil action after an allegation of rape made against him by Kathryn Mayorga. He strenuously denies the allegation, which Mayorga, now 34, claims took place in the summer of 2009.She alleges the footballer assaulted her in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009, then used “fixers” to stop her pursuing criminal charges – including paying her $375,000 “hush money”. Police confirmed the original case was closed in 2009 due to Mayorga not disclosing details but it was reopened in September after she went public, inspired, she said, by the #MeToo movement.“Of course, this story is interfering in my life,” Ronaldo said. “I have a partner, four children, an ageing mother, sisters, a brother, a family with whom I am very close. Not to mention my reputation, which is that of someone exemplary ... Imagine what it means when someone accuses you of rape, whether you have all that or not. I know who I am and what I did. Truth will out one day. And the people who criticise me or seek to expose my life today, who make it into a circus, these people will see.”He added: “I explained to my partner. My son, Cristiano Jr, is too young to understand. It’s worst for my mother and my sisters. They are stunned, and at the same time very angry. This is the first time I have seen them in this state.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d769d8efe6e5a8bf36d3bf73c08badf587d49ca/0_89_1517_910/master/1517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1fb1a89e706c755e104e892fc807cb7","title":"manchester united back jose mourinho january transfer window 100m","story":"• Transfer window funds available if right deals struck• Manager wants a central defender and goalscorerJosé Mourinho will be backed in January to strengthen Manchester United if the right deal is possible in what can be a difficult transfer window to find value.The manager wants a central defender and goalscoring forward after unsuccessfully trying to sign each in the summer.More than £100m is potentially available.

At Anfield on Saturday volunteers from Liverpool FC and Spirit of Shankly supporters’ union held a bucket collection to raise money for Sean Cox, the 53-year-old Liverpool fan who sustained life-altering injuries after being attacked before the Champions League semi-final against Roma in April. The father of three is undergoing rehabilitation in Dún Laoghaire but this will take many years and require significant funding. The fundraising appeal has attracted generous donations from Jürgen Klopp, Everton’s Séamus Coleman and the former Liverpool managing director Christian Purslow – plus many anonymous donors – and contributions from match‑goers on Saturday. Liverpool have pledged their official charity, LFC Foundation, will match all money raised by the bucket collection on Saturday. A fundraising page for Sean Cox’s care can be found at ie.gofundmeSupportSeanCox. Andy HunterWhen Roberto Martínez managed Ross Barkley at Everton, the Spaniard dubbed his force of midfield nature “an amalgam of Paul Gascoigne and Michael Ballack”. A combination of injury and loss of form led to this special talent losing his place with both Everton and England. He had not exactly fallen off the edge of the world but when Barkley joined Chelsea for £15m last January it seemed a gamble. Now it looks a bargain. Those who, in August, wondered where Barkley would fit into an apparently overstocked Chelsea midfield cannot argue he is not worthy of a starting place. At Burnley he scored a beautiful goal, created another for Willian and denied Sean Dyche’s side a goal. Like Wayne Rooney and Jonjo Shelvey, Barkley still has something of the street footballer about him. How wonderful to see his improvisational talent thriving once more. Louise TaylorCrystal Palace have looked more like their former selves in the past week. Admittedly, their efforts at Everton and at home against Arsenal have yielded a solitary point, and the forthcoming matches against Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United are still distinctly daunting. But this team appear to have rediscovered some of their more abrasive qualities after a low-key, rather slack start to the campaign. Wilfried Zaha looked fit and far more of a livewire against Arsenal. There is energy to their midfield and from full-back, and aggression at centre‑half. Luka Milivojevic, off colour up to now, has his first goals of the campaign. Roy Hodgson’s substitutions were decisive, with Max Meyer influential in his cameo and even Alexander Sørloth looking more the part. Most importantly, a run of defeats has been checked. Those games to come against the elite still feel treacherous, but the qualities which thrust Palace into mid-table in the run-in last season clearly remain. Dominic FifieldMesut Özil’s most dynamic involvement at Selhurst Park was when he dragged himself off the pitch after the assistant referee showed his number in red lights in the 68th minute. When he got a yard beyond Unai Emery, he took off his gloves and threw them to the floor, showing his frustration for an absent performance. The German midfielder was the Arsenal captain once again but influenced neither the play nor the spirit of his team with a meek outing. In tight games, when the opposition are offering little space to operate in, it is Özil’s role to find the gaps and change the dynamic but instead he operated on the periphery waiting for the game to come to him rather than the other way round, as Arsenal relied on two set-pieces to earn a barely deserved point. Will Unwin• The Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photosThis was not the plan when Fulham spent north of £100m in the summer. One victory, two draws and seven defeats have left them in the bottom three, with whispers (publicly scotched by the owner, Shahid Khan) that Slavisa Jokanovic’s job is under threat. Perhaps the most worrying thing is the sense of chaos around team selection. Jokanovic has used 22 players including three goalkeepers, made 25 starting XI changes and used at least four formations. “Slav Bingo” has become a popular pre‑lineup announcement game, and the inconsistency in selection is probably the main reason why they have failed to recreate the attacking football that got them promoted. It is not all his fault, but Jokanovic is at least realistic about his prospects. “The owner didn’t bring me here because I am a good lad,” he said on Saturday. “He brought me here to win games. This is my challenge, and I’m up for that.” Nick MillerThe difference between Brighton and most of the teams below them is they can win without playing to their best thanks to their defensive fortitude. Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk can be spectacular in the way they repel opponents, and the goalkeeper Mat Ryan is excellent. Those were the three outstanding performers on Saturday, keeping out a mostly dominant Wolves team so that Glenn Murray’s goal was enough to secure a victory. It was a third consecutive clean sheet and win for Chris Hughton’s men but the manager does not want to keep relying excessively on his defenders. “To see the performance against Wolves and last week, they are not bad performances but you can only have so many of them,” he said. “The law of averages says that if a team have more shots, more crosses, then the balance will go in their favour. So we need to up our game.” Paul DoyleTheo Walcott always seems a very likeable man, but he is an infuriating footballer. Twice at Old Trafford, he broke into the right-hand side of the box with Richarlison inside him. On both occasions, to the Brazilian’s fury, he chose to take on a shot rather than square the ball. His first shot was weak his second beaten away comfortably by David de Gea. And that wasn’t even his most negative contribution. Both United goals came from him losing possession and, for the second, he barely raised a run to track back, which left Anthony Martial in space to receive Paul Pogba’s pass and score. For a player so experienced – he may seem locked in a bubble of eternal potential, but Walcott is 29 now – to be guilty of such a dereliction was staggering. At some point, the Peter Pan of English football needs to grow up and start taking responsibility. Jonathan Wilson• Match report: Manchester United 2-1 Everton• Silva accuses Martial of ing for penaltyPerhaps it was because little happened in this match, but neither manager seemed fussed by the result. Mark Hughes shrugged off a smattering of missed chances, reflecting that his team had done enough to win. Rafael Benítez was pleased enough with the visitors’ defending, and hoped a point might prove a stepping stone. There may, however, have been another explanation for the prevailing calm. After 10 matches, Southampton and Newcastle may have 10 points between them, but they’re hardly the only ones struggling. In total, the bottom six have conjured up 30 points, easily the lowest total of recent seasons. This time last year, the cumulative figure was 46. In 2016 it was 43, in 2015 44, and in 2014 it was 50. The implication being: a lower points total might be enough to stay up. So not quite time to panic just yet then. Paul MacInnesIt is more than two years since Watford signed Isaac Success from Granada for a then club-record fee of around £12.5m. He remains the second most expensive player in thesquad but in his subsequent obscurity his fee has been forgotten. In his first season he started two league games, nearly six months apart. Last season he spent six games on the bench and no minutes on the pitch before joining Málaga on loan in January, where he failed to score. He has now started consecutive league games, both of them won, and while his passing on Saturday was not always perfect he demonstrated plenty of quality and also, importantly, fitness, before scoring his first Premier League goal in 25 months. “I realised just before the start of this season that talent was not enough, and hard work will always beat talent,” said the Nigerian. “I think I have now become a better person, I have become a better professional and that helped my career a lot.” Simon Burnton"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f1947ff959b8c02e597d3b83a81d9be3e59583/0_216_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4490829817637e19e6763c37847d2d00","title":"thai sporting and political leaders pay tribute to leicester city owner vichai srivaddhanaprabha","story":"As Thailand woke on Monday morning to the confirmation that Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the reclusive but beloved billionaire owner of King Power retail and Leicester City football club, had been among the five who died in the helicopter crash outside the stadium, the tributes began pouring in.Figures in the world of Thai politics, football and even the royal family spoke of a “warm” and “generous” man, who had brought national pride to Thailand in his role as a businessman and as Leicester City chairman.Nualphan Lamsam, who manages Thailand’s national women’s football team, sent “thoughts and prayers” to Vichai’s family, while Anutin Charnvirakul, leader of the Bhumjai Thai political party, told local media that he considered Vichai to be like a “big brother”“He is a self-made man, worked hard and loved friends dearly,” he said. “We just lost someone who made big contributions to the public. I am sure his legacy will live on.”Little was known about Vichai, owner of the King Power duty free retail empire, who opened his first shop in 1989 and by 2006 had been given a monopoly over the main Thai airports. Much of his success was credited to his ability to weather Thailand’s turbulent political environment, a rare ally of both the former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who now lives in exile, and the current ruling military junta.However, it was his purchase of Leicester City in 2010 that pushed Vichai into the public eye. Thailand, a football-loving nation, became as swept up in the club’s remarkable ascendence to Premier League triumph as fans in the UK and prompted swathes of Thais to switch their allegiances from the popular clubs Manchester United and Liverpool to become proud Leicester supporters.While he mainly shied from the limelight even in his home country, Vichai was particularly respected among Thais for speaking publicly about how “Thai values and Thai culture” were at the heart of how he ran Leicester City.After their triumphant league win in 2016, Vichai brought the team back to Thailand to show off their trophy to crowds of thousands who gathered in the streets of Bangkok. Chatworachet Sae-Kow, a Leicester City fan in Bangkok, explained how much the success of the club under Vichai’s leadership meant to the country.Kawin Thamsatchanan, goalkeeper for the Thai national team who plays for Oud-Heverlee Leuven – the Belgium football club also owned by Vichai – paid a lengthy and personal tribute to the King Power magnate, speaking of the impact he had on his life and thanking him for the opportunity to live out his dream and play football in Europe.“I could feel your commitment and dedication to what you do, and the warmth and love you had for me,” said Kawin. “Thank you for the opportunity and confidence in me.”Vichai’s connections to the upper echelons of Thai society were also demonstrated by the personal condolences offered by Thai royal family member, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Bavardi, who said Vichai’s death was a “great loss to the football world”. The eldest daughter of the now exiled Thaksin Shinawatra – who had been an ally and champion of Vichai’s – also spoke of her disbelief.The Football Association of Thailand released a statement expressing its “profound sadness” at the “sudden and tragic passing” of Vichai. Following the news of the crash on Sunday, the head of the FA Thailand, Somyot Poompanmoung, who was extremely close to Vichai, travelled to the UK.Four other passengers who died in the crash were named by Leicestershire police as Nursara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare, both members of Vichai’s staff, pilot Eric Swaffer and passenger Izabela Roza Lechowicz."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfcce75551f8a6c9384ef99650d82c47e496019c/0_183_2742_1645/master/2742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e44cdbb60f6a5fb5e1cc4915d78054e","title":"wembley pitch spurs manchester city tottenham nfl american football","story":"Premier League match kicks off 30 hours after NFL game and Wembley can call no time outs in bid to have perfect surfaceIf Wembley’s ground staff are feeling sorry for themselves at the prospect of turning a pitch prepared for the NFL match between Jacksonville Jaguars and Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday into a surface perfect for the Premier League match between Tottenham and Manchester City on Monday night in less than a day, they can seek some solace in the fact that some of their predecessors had it very much worse.The Spurs game will kick off 30.5 hours after the NFL match, but in 1991 Wembley had to cope with a game between the London Monarchs and Orlando Thunder that started at 8pm on a Saturday night, with Crystal Palace playing Everton in the Full Members’ Cup final, then known as the Zenith Data Systems Cup, only 19 hours later on Sunday afternoon.“The Monarchs game finished about 10pm, and we worked right the way through till 1pm on Sunday,” says Steve Tingley, then Wembley’s head groundsman. “By the time we got rid of all the lines and numbers it was about 4am before we could get a mower out there, and mow it in a football pattern.”This is not the only problem the current groundstaff will encounter as they attempt to give Wembley a 24-hour transformation. Like many Premier League teams the pitch is strengthened with a Desso system, which knits the grass with polypropylene fibres. This makes it much less likely to cut up, but also reduces options when there is wear.“We had a normal playing surface based on sand and soil and it would ot,” says Tingley. “American football was an awful sport to play on our pitch because it used to cut up so bad. Obviously in American football they make a play, go back to the same place, make another play and go back to the same place, and it’s all through the middle of the field. So the centre of your field gets absolutely trashed.“These days they have Desso which stops it from doing that. They’re far luckier than we were. We spent hours that night just putting ots back. But in my opinion Desso isn’t perfect for Wembley, because it doesn’t allow you to right the wrongs of American football, concerts and whatever else. It’s very hard to recreate the playing surface between games. Some other products allow you to take worn areas away and replace them with perfect turf again.“In 1992 we had seven or eight Monarchs games, and it absolutely destroyed the centre of the pitch. So we commissioned a company to make a machine that would cut turf in one-metre-squared sections, two inches thick, so we could swap them out. In the week leading up to the FA Cup final we replaced the entire centre of the pitch, and nobody could have noticed there had been American football on.“I did enjoy the challenge, and I’m sure the guys at Wembley will be in a similar mode now. One time the stadium manager came to me and asked if we could do rugby league on a Saturday and football on a Sunday, and we did it. And then I realised what we’d done: we’d opened the door for them to do more. Then the Monarchs came along, or the Nelson Mandela tribute concert three weeks before a Cup final. You do things you’ve never done before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1471a0f4ff3f63ef98feb076850e5a88d6cbb5ec/0_270_4672_2803/master/4672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec7099e5aa94eeb098a32120f8085c4a","title":"luis suarez barcelona real madrid floundering again clasico football","story":"In the last decade, Barcelona had beaten Real Madrid 5-0, 4-3, 3-2, 4-0, 3-1 and 6-2.

They wouldn’t have wanted to miss this for the world and, off work with a broken arm, he didn’t have anything better to do. Besides, he was taking his son anyway. So, Sofi stayed home with five-day-old Lautaro and watched on telly while Benja and Delfina had a day out with Lionel and Thiago Messi, sitting together in the Camp Nou front row cheering as their dad scored three against Real Madrid: an eight-year-old, a six-year-old, a five-year-old and the only other man to have done that (twice, in fact) since Romario snapped Rafa Alkorta’s hips in two in January 1994.When Luis Suárez scored his first in Sunday’s clásico, he dashed to the camera and lifted up his shirt to reveal a photo of Benja, Delfina and their new little brother, “welcome, Lauti” written on the front when he scored his second, he ran over to give them a kiss and when he scored his third, he ducked behind the goal at the north end and held his hand to his ear. Listen to that. The roar rocked the place, they chanted “Uruguayo! Uruguayo!” and then they bounced about, singing: “Boing! Boing! Boing!

Silently, he sat, head in hands. “It hurts,” he said later, but it will all be over soon. Very, very soon.The scoreboard read 4-1 to Barcelona, 83 minutes in, but the clásico hadn’t finished yet. They were enjoying this – “I would have liked the game to go on longer,” Sergi Roberto said after – and there was still time for four to become five, Arturo Vidal arriving to score a goal that might have made little difference but made all the difference. There was even time for Suárez to almost score a sixth, a superb volley with the side of his heel pushed away by Thibault Courtois, yet somehow it was almost better that way. When it comes to Barcelona beating Madrid there is no more symbolic scoreline than five and amid the celebrations Gerard Piqué did something he’s done before: he raised his hand, palm open, fingers outstretched.All around the stadium they did the same, like 93,265 people waving goodbye to Lopetegui. At the end, while Delfina and Benja headed on to the pitch, Casemiro stood and said: “We’re a disaster, all of us.” Anaemic in the first half, absent to the point of abdication, El País noting a magpie had settled on the pitch occupying an empty space where Gareth Bale was supposed to be, Madrid had reacted in the second. There were signs of a resuscitation, but ultimately they had been ripped to bits. “As if shredded by Banksy,” as Javier Cáceres put it in Süddeutsche Zeitung. It was no one-off. “This game was the image of our season,” Casemiro said, and that brings consequences.Madrid have lost three league games in a row, winning one of their last six matches in all competitions and going eight hours and one minute without scoring. They left the Camp Nou in ninth place. Ninth. They have lost as many games as they have won under Lopetegui, who has suffered the worst start of any Madrid coach ever. He gave up all that – Spain, the World Cup, the greatest opportunity of his life – for this. He knows his time at Madrid is over it’s early still but he’s known for a while, in fact. “I know what football’s like,” he said on Sunday. Soon he will be sacked again, the two biggest jobs taken away in the space of four months.“I don’t like managers getting sacked,” said Barcelona coach, Ernesto Valverde. Their fans, by contrast, were enjoying this, giggling and chanting for Lopetegui to stay, sarcastically serenading him with declarations of love. But that was not what the hand was about. And nor was this just about Real Madrid. “It’s simple: we scored five goals and that’s it,” Piqué said. “It’s a tradition, and I hope it won’t be the last time.” A raised hand, fingers outstretched, one for each goal scored, it started when Romario scored that hat-trick in 1994, Johan Cruyff’s assistant Toni Bruins Slot the man who first did it, and Piqué, a Barça member from birth, led them in doing the same when they beat Madrid 5-0 in 2010. “This is the kind of game that will go down in history,” Piqué added. “We have to enjoy it today, tomorrow and the day after.”There have been an extraordinary number of moments like this of late big scorelines and big victories. Especially away. In the last decade, Barcelona have beaten Madrid 5-0, 4-3, 3-2, 4-0, 3-1, 3-0, and 6-2. Now they had added 5-1 to that – and without Messi. One by one Barcelona’s players insisted this didn’t mean they didn’t need him. “If he had been there too it would have been the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” Santi Giménez wrote in AS.It was bad enough anyway. For all Madrid’s problems, few expected it to go quite like this. Those results reflect that this has been Messi’s decade and Messi was injured. When Valverde had said his absence wouldn’t affect them, he was being sarcastic. Everyone said it would not be the same without Messi. And while he had been injured when they won 4-0 in 2015 too, only playing the final half an hour then and coming on with the score already at 3-0, back then they had Neymar, stepping into the space. And yet, there they were raising their hands again at the end this time.“This was a game to remember,” Valverde said. “Historic,” Sport called it. “Humiliating,” Marca’s cover said. Victory over Inter in midweek had brought hope, Valverde choosing to reinforce midfield rather than try to replace Messi, and here he repeated that, Ivan Rakitic, Arthur and Busquets dominating. Barcelona had control and a manager who read the game right. The sense of superiority was overwhelming in the first half, even if chances were few, Nacho entirely exposed. At half-time it was 2-0 and hard to avoid the feeling that, if they really went for it, Barcelona would easily get more.Then, suddenly, they were overrun at the start of the second, but while Lopetegui’s shift to three centre-backs worked, Valverde reacted. “The score doesn’t reflect the reality,” Lopetegui lamented and there might have been something in that, at least for those minutes – this was an odd game, as well as a brilliant one – but Barcelona found a way through the storm, adapting to a match that had become stretched, eventually tearing Madrid to bits. Nelson Semedo went on and Sergi Roberto, who never seems to take a bad decision, moved up. Ousmane Dembélé was introduced too and, while it might have only been 20 minutes each on either side of the midfieldattack, those two were decisive, providing three assists.Sergi Roberto was superb. Coutinho got the opener. Clément Lenglet embodied calmness. Arthur has a touch of the Xavi about him, everyone says, although perhaps they shouldn’t. And it may not be too much of an exaggeration to describe Jordi Alba as the best player in Spain right now. Barcelona had all that. Most of all, though, they had Suárez. Which many thought was not enough.There have been doubts – “the fat prize”, one headline said on Monday, perhaps a little pointedly, alongside a photo of him – but Valverde didn’t share them. The talk was always of goals or the lack of them. In their absence, sometimes it was about work not enough was said about the passing and the vision, and still the doubts remained. “He provided two assists against Spurs without even touching the ball,” Barcelona’s manager said, “and then after the game someone asked me: ‘Luis didn’t score …’ Bloody hell! Look, I’ve played against Barcelona lots of times and whenever a manager took Luis off I was pretty much ready to give him a hug.”This time he was very much ready to do so. This time, Suárez was on his side, playing virtually alone up front, embracing the responsibility. His run dragged Sergio Ramos into the net as Coutinho scored the first, he was fouled for the penalty which he took to make it 2-0 and he provided a superb cross for Piqué as they sought the third. And yet he had walked off at half-time heavy-legged, frustrated, head in hands, muttering to himself, annoyed he had made a horrible mess of a counterattack as four men broke free just before. By full time, though, he walked off holding the match ball, top of the table, seven points clear of Madrid.“Congratulations on the hat-trick,” one radio reporter said. “Which one?” Suárez shot back, smiling. “It’s been an important week. My son was born and it makes me happy that his little brother and sister wanted to come to the stadium to see me.”Suárez has now scored nine times in nine La Liga clásicos, decisive in the season they won the treble and at the Bernabéu last time Messi was missing. These three took him to 159 Barcelona goals and mean he has scored against Madrid in every season he has spent in Spain. It might have been even more goals, too: those two heeled volleys were something special, the first hitting the post, the second saved by Courtois. In the end he had to settle for three, becoming the only player to have scored a clásico hat-trick in 25 years now. Apart, that is, from the man sitting in the stand babysitting his kids on their grand day out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50f033b8dc04e8ee500622ea10a32472af37d40b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9db617216be55de43c4897fe20f76ce","title":"womens super league talking points from the weekends action","story":"Arsenal surf wave of confidence Vicky Jepson tightens Liverpool’s defence Manchester City need to have a plan BArsenal got their second-least convincing result of the Super League season against Bristol City: a 4-0 win. The same names keep cropping up on the scoresheet: Danielle van de Donk, Vivianne Miedema and Jordan Nobbs were on the mark again. The big difference between this season and the last is that Miedema is staying fit and Nobbs has added goals to what was already a fantastic game. It means that they have not missed Kim Little, who broke a leg against Chelsea a couple of weeks ago. Little is their captain, the most-capped Scotland player and extremely influential but this Arsenal machine has not missed a beat. They are blowing teams away, whether it was Chelsea (5-0), Reading (6-0) or Bristol City: the level of performance does not change. Some teams are up for certain games and perhaps slightly complacent for others but Arsenal just keep doing what they are doing with no regard for the opposition. They are riding the crest of a wave and there is simply no holding them back.The 1-0 defeat at Chelsea meant Vicky Jepson’s first game since being confirmed as Liverpool’s full-time manager ended disappointingly but there was still encouragement there. Four of their five league games since being thrashed 5-0 by Arsenal on the opening day have finished 1-0, with two won and two lost, and the other they won 2-1. They seem to have tightened up defensively compared with the end of last season and that is to Jepson’s credit: they always had sound defenders, such as Sophie Bradley-Auckland and Leandra Little, but they just needed some direction. Jepson, and her assistant Chris Kirkland, seem to be providing it. They were second best at Chelsea but it was a resilient performance and an organised one. Rinsola Babajide, the tall, young English forward, offered excitement. She has got the speed and confidence to bring the ball off the wing and drive infield and offers something different, a threat that Liverpool did not have before she signed from Watford in January. It was her second start of the season and she somehow personifies her team: a bit raw, just starting out but looks like she is going to get a lot better.Chelsea have been pinning their goalscoring hopes on Ji So-yun, Fran Kirby and Drew Spence, and not very successfully – they had scored only two goals, and in one game, before Sunday – so it would have been encouraging for them to see Magdalena Eriksson step up and carry some of that burden. The Swede’s smart overhead was her outstanding moment but Eriksson’s attacking contributions were a feature of the game, and had her crosses from the left been better converted Chelsea’s victory would have been more comfortable. Having struggled so badly in front of goal the team seemed to relax once they took the lead but could not take any of their other chances. The champions are making very hard work of retaining the title, a feat which even at this very early stage is looking very unlikely given Arsenal’s form. However they are fourth and have played the rest of the top five: they will not have to play any of those teams again until mid-January, by which time the table may look very different.Manchester City were held at home by Reading on Friday and are three points behind Arsenal, who have a game in hand. They know they need to have their foot to the floor, iron out those mistakes and then get something from their visit to Arsenal in early December. Their results have not been terrible but their problem is they have played the same way since their inception: playing out from the back through Keira Walsh, getting the ball wide and then driving into the box or crossing. This season there are two key differences: other teams are getting better and they know exactly what City are going to do. Their tactics have been very effective but if they never change their style and their opponents continue to improve tactically and technically, it will pay off less and less. They have also lost key players in each of the last two summers: Lucy Bronze in 2017 and Izzy Christiansen this year, both to Lyon. They were two very attacking players and having created a team whose effectiveness came from speed and power those departures have made a big difference.Once again Everton, second-bottom last season, find themselves above only Yeovil in the table. In their second season of being professional they seem to have gone backwards. In the summer they lost their No 9, Courtney Sweetman-Kirk, to Liverpool and now they are finding out what a difference she made. She is a tireless worker, one of those who chases everything, and maybe Everton are missing that work rate. They did not always get the results but at times last season they would terrify their opponents, flying at them with a high press. I watched them at Chelsea, where they lost 1-0 but matched the champions-to-be in a lot of areas and were really dangerous on the counterattack. In the summer they signed relatively unknown players and maybe that gamble is not paying off – they certainly seem to have lost some of that youthfulness and energy. On Sunday they were 1-0 up and lost a week earlier they were 3-1 up at home to Birmingham and drew – throwing away points is an unfortunate habit to get into."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dceff5a99da4f63b8d881adb13c5bab28742defb/205_412_2647_1588/master/2647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f43ee73ef8d5ff47a434c1413486246","title":"five scenic uk cycle routes for beginners","story":"Cycling doesn’t have to be all about endurance, speed and derring-do – it’s also an activity that can be relaxing and even meditative. These five routes are perfect for those looking to take on longer rides at a gentler paceMore and more people are rediscovering cycling as a gentle way to exercise and explore new places on their own steam. Cycling lets us experience our surroundings in new ways – from the sights and smells we might miss in the car, to the simple pleasure of feeling the wind in our hair. It’s also something just about anyone can enjoy: cycling is non-weight bearing, and for many people it’s easier than walking. There are also bikes to suit most needs. With some great, flat, traffic-free or low-traffic routes across the UK that you can enjoy at a gentle pace, inspiration and adventure are just around the corner.Distance: 18 milesStart: PadstowEnd: Wenford BridgeTime taken to cycle: one-and-a-half to two hours without stopsThe Camel Trail is one of the UK’s best-loved cycle trails, not least with families, for its beautiful waterside scenery and wealth of wildlife. From picturesque Padstow it follows the Camel estuary’s shore, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and home to little egrets, peregrines, ospreys and kingfishers. The delightful riveted Little Petherick creek bridge once served the former railway line. After an on-road section through Wadebridge it wends through wooded country beside the River Camel, past Bodmin, before briefly skirting Bodmin Moor, to Wenford Bridge.Pit stopTreats on Trikes is a traditional tea, cake and ice cream vendor on a tricycle, midway between Padstow and Wadebridge, at Penquean quarry.Distance: 13 milesStart: Sirhowy valley country parkEnd: Taff Bargoed parkTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours without stopsExplore three south Wales valleys parks by bike. Starting at Sirhowy valley country park, north-west of Newport, you’ll follow a former railway line over the listed Hengoed viaduct, with its 16 towering arches, and past the Wheel o Drams, an 8-metre tall circular sculpture of mining carts. Penallta country park once housed the deepest pit in the south Wales coalfields, and now features viewpoints, wetlands, and the UK’s largest earth sculpture – Sultan the Pit Pony (above, top left). You’ll finish in Taff Bargoed park, once three pits, and now a wildlife haven perfect for a riverside picnic.

No wonder the fitness world loves itIf you have an injury or health condition, consult your doctor before doing these exercisesIt doesn’t take much time to improve your health. HIIT has become a staple in the fitness world and for good reason: it’s the time-efficient, super-effective way to get fitter that’s backed by science.But it doesn’t always have to mean donning your lycra – in fact, research shows that as little as a minute of HIIT can benefit the body. The workouts below take two minutes each, one for each hour of your working day. They target every muscle group in the body, require no equipment and can be done in very little space.The benefits? You’ll boost your circulation and energy levels every hour, so no more wanting to sleep face down on your keyboard it will increase your cardio fitness, muscle strength and core stability, and you’ll continue to burn calories even after you’re back at your desk!Before doing each workout, warm up by gently jogging on the spot for 30 seconds and then standing and raising one knee at a time in front of you – 10 on each leg. Work as hard as you can for the 20-second bursts of exercise. At the end of the workout, pace around for 30 seconds to cool down and stretch out any muscles that feel tight.Each workout follows the same pattern: do the first three exercises for 20 seconds each, with 10 seconds of rest in between each one. Do the fourth exercise for 30 seconds:Plank Lie on your front, hands beneath your shoulders, elbows pointing back. Tuck your toes under and push yourself up until your arms are straight, pulling your navel up towards your spine so you feel the core stability muscles around your middle engage. Keep looking at the floor and make sure your bottom is neither sagging towards the floor nor pushing up towards the ceiling.Press-ups From a plank position, bend your elbows to lower yourself towards the floor. Letting your elbows flare out to the side works the chest harder keeping them nearer your sides focuses more on the triceps. A full-press up is touching your nose almost to the ground, but you may not get that far to start with. The most important thing is to keep a straight line from your knees, to hips, to head. Balance on your knees rather than your feet to make it easier if needed.Jumping jacksStand with feet together and hands by your sides. Simultaneously, jump your feet out sideways and swing your arms out to the side and up until your fingertips meet above your head. Jump back to starting position.Bottom kicksJog on the spot, flicking your heels up to kick your bottom.High kneesJog on the spot while bringing your knees up high in front of you. Use your arms to really drive the movement and go as fast as you can. If this is too vigorous for you, do the same action but as though you’re walking rather than running.Mountain climbersFrom a plank position, lift your right foot off the floor and drive the knee towards your chest. Place the foot back and repeat with your left knee. Don’t stick your bottom high in the air and keep a rapid flow.Shadow boxStand with feet hip-width apart and bring fists up into a boxing position. Punch upwards with the right hand then the left, then punch across your body with your right hand then left, allowing your body to rotate towards the direction of the punch and heel to come off the floor.Bear crawlKneel on all fours, hands directly under your shoulders, knees under your hips. Tuck your toes under and lift your knees to hover a few inches above the ground. Now crawl forwards – right arm at same time as left leg and vice versa – for six paces, then crawl backwards for six. Keep your abdominals engaged and back as flat as possible (imagine you’re balancing something on it).Reverse lungesStand with feet hip-width apart. Step back with your left foot, lowering the front knee to a right angle or deeper. Focus on using the glute in your right buttock to power back up to standing. Repeat with the right leg.Sumo squatsStand with feet wide apart, toes turned slightly out (about 45-degree angle), hands clasped in front of your chest. Keeping your back straight, bend your knees in the direction of your toes (but don’t go beyond them) to lower yourself until your knees are as near to 90 degrees as possible. Keep your weight in your heels. Come back to standing.Squats or jump squatsStand with feet just wider than hip-width apart. Cross your arms and place your hands on opposite shoulders. Keeping your torso upright and chest facing forward, bend your knees and stick your bottom out, spread your weight through your heels and ensure that your knees don’t stick out beyond the end of your toes. For a full squat, you’re aiming to lower your bottom to knee height while keeping your chest facing forward, but go as far as is comfortable. Return to standing. To make squats harder, add in a little jump at the top of the move.Bicycle crunchesLie on your back with feet flat on the floor, hands touching your ears, elbows out to the side. Simultaneously, lift your feet and head off the floor and begin to slowly move your legs in a pedalling motion. As your right knee comes towards you, bring your left elbow towards it and vice versa with the left knee and right elbow. Keep your torso still by engaging your core stability muscles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bde53bfab45f752f0423461a10de1c7b166975/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93f40f06a7976a63d80404621f00899d","title":"nine simple ways to revamp your workspace for a healthier environment","story":"Improving your posture at work, adding some greenery to your desk and moving to a window seat are just some of the quick fixes that can transform your productivityThere’s a lot more to happiness in the workplace than a comfortable salary. In fact, working more than 40 hours a week may well be doing you a considerable disservice and directly affecting your health and performance at work. Thankfully, taking a few minutes of your day and deploying intelligent fixes can turn your office from a dreary workspace to an area that transforms your productivity and mindset. Here are nine ways you can make your office work for you.Take a standThere’s a reason standing desks – no longer the reserve of agile Silicon Roundabout startups – are quickly making their way into the offices of multinationals. Encouraging employees to be considerably more aware of their posture at work, adjustable desks and workstations such as Varidesk and the Yo-Yo desk are quickly becoming adopted by offices across the UK. What’s more, sitting for more than six hours a day leaves you at greater risk of anxiety and depression, according to the Association for Psychological Science – meaning that an eight-hour day spent on your rear quickly becomes an unhealthy habit.Spring cleaningOld meeting notes, dirty mugs, empty sandwich boxes and a dirty keyboard all add up to an unhappy desk. According to a study by Princeton Neuroscience Institute, “multiple visual stimuli” – also known as unwelcome desk clutter – compete for attention in your brain, meaning you can remove distraction with a desk free of unnecessary mess. Similarly, you’ll want to give your keyboard a wipe-down every week or so, as the average keyboard has 20,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat.Stretch it outStressful experiences – at work and at home – have the potential to age the human brain by four years, according to a 2017 study presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s conference. Thankfully, you can de-stress and fight poor posture at your desk by working through this stretching routine. To open up your back, bring your hands behind you and press your palms together. Bring your elbows back and downwards, slowly tucking your chin – hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat three times. Consider this your first step to become a more supple – and pain-free – human.Make a moveFor now, there are no stringent laws on taking screen breaks, but the Health and Safety Executive recommends a five- to 10-minute break every hour. Standing up and walking around will help stretch your body, adjust your posture and increase productivity and attention, as well as the quality of your work.Give yourself a handSpending 35-plus hours at a desk each week is hardly appealing, the very real prospect of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) – a condition in which a nerve in your wrist is under pressure, causing numb hands, weakness and tingling – is far worse. Common in men and women over 40 years old, CTS stems from repetitive actions such as using a mouse and keyboard. Handily, ergonomic office equipment – Microsoft Surface and Mac-friendly Kinesis Freestyle are two of the UK’s most popular options – can help stave CTS off. The oddly shaped equipment improves forearm posture, adds comfort and supports your hands. You’ll agree that it’ll be worth a few odd looks.Thirsty workWorkplace absence in the UK is costing £18bn annually, according to analysis from Centre of Economic and Business Research. That’s a total of 168m working days lost annually. While there’s no sole reason for this, it’s important to adopt everyday habits to keep you as healthy as possible in the workplace. Dehydration, for example, even at a mild level, directly affects both physical and mental performance, meaning that you’ll find it hard to concentrate during work hours and struggle with that post-work run. Women should aim for two litres a day, and men for three litres.Light workIf constantly feeling tired is making office life a miserable reality, it could be because of the light levels in your office. A 2013 study from the Netherlands found that when office workers were exposed to more daylight during the working week, they were less sleepy and considerably more energetic. Similarly, researchers from Turkey found that study participants who had three hours or more of daylight a day felt considerably happier and more satisfied – muting the chance of office burnout. Push for that window desk and reap the rewards immediately.Pain in the neckYour career, rather unfortunately, is wreaking havoc on your neck. A combination of poor posture and stress, which affects your sleep, is likely to be causing unnecessary neck pain. Rarely a sign of something more serious, neck pain can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers such as Voltarol, which can be taken orally or applied directly to the affected area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8edc98c00ef1f77ebd73c6987ba10c13e222769c/0_203_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2e49b470dba5d46f6128b6e5361f15b","title":"alkaline water cure bs science beyonce tom brady","story":"Beyonce and Tom Brady swear by it – but experts throw cold water on the new beverage fadMy friend Kate has become very basic lately. She seems to have a bottle of alkaline water with her at all times and, the way she goes on about it, you’d think it was the elixir of life. It has improved her skin! Upped her focus! Tastes great! Someone bought her a bottle of the stuff when she was hungover (it’s brilliant for hangovers!) and she’s been a convert ever since.She’s not the only one. Alkaline water, which is water that has been treated to have a higher pH level than the 6.5-7.5 pH range of most tap and bottled water, is experiencing a surge of popularity. Beyonce helped kickstart the trend in 2013 when reports surfaced that she included alkaline water on a rider for her Mrs Carter Show world tour. Tom Brady is another celebrity who has professed his love for the stuff. According to data from the Beverage Marketing Corporation, a research and consultancy group, the alkaline water market has grown from being a $47m business in 2014 to a $427m business in 2017. It’s projected to be worth $687m by the end of 2018.There are a variety of alkaline water brands on the market including Core, Essentia, and Alkaline88. Essentia has a pH of 9.5, achieved after putting regular water through an ionizing process that removes acidic components. This, the company claims, results in “better hydration”. Alkaline88 meanwhile, has a pH of 8.8 “designed to obtain optimum body balance”.Why would drinking water with a higher pH level be better for you? Dr Tanis Fenton, an adjunct professor at the University of Calgary and an evidence analyst for Dietitians of Canada, told me that the marketing claims behind alkaline water are based on an old idea called the acid-ash hypothesis. This posits that eating certain food like meat, dairy and eggs results in something called acid ash in your body, which increases your acid levels and causes adverse health effects including osteoporosis.In 2002 an alternative medicine practitioner called Robert O Young spun the acid-ash hypothesis into a fad alkaline diet, with a popular series of books called the pH Miracle. According to these books, an alkaline diet could treat all manner of woes, from poor digestion to cancer. Young, by the way, was sentenced to three years in jail in 2017 for practicing medicine without a license.While people have been touting the benefits of upping your alkaline levels for decades, Fenton says the belief is not supported by any scientific evidence. Fenton, who analyzed studies looking at the association of alkaline water with cancer treatment, notes that while “there are a few very poorly designed studies” that suggest alkaline water confers health benefits, there is no rigorous evidence this is the case.While you can’t change the pH of your blood, your diet does affect the pH of your urine. “Most people’s urine is about 6, which is acidic,” she explains. However, “that’s no problem, that shows our kidneys is working.” So while it’s possible drinking alkaline water may make your urine less acidic, that doesn’t really make a difference you’re literally just flushing money down the drain. Ultimately, says Fenton, alkaline water is a solution to a problem that doesn’t need solving.As well as riding the wellness wave, alkaline water is also part of a “rising connoisseurship around water”, says Lucie Greene, the worldwide director of a trends and consumer behavior group at advertising agency J Walter Thompson. Bottled water recently became the number one drink in the US for the first time in history, overtaking soda, which is declining in popularity.“We’re seeing multiple trends and selling points within water at the moment,” Greene explained over email. “From ‘raw’ water (literally water from the ground) which was popularized by Silicon Valley Burning Man advocates, to water with electrolytes. There are now halal mineral waters. And waters that have been doctored to have special properties and benefits, like Oxigen, the oxygenated water brand that claims to boost the benefits of water by harnessing O4, a proprietary molecule that delivers a concentrated dose of oxygen.”Greene also notes that Instagram has radically “accelerated the pace of food, drink and health trends”. We’re seeing things move “from fringe to global trend at a much faster rate than before”. Brands like Essentia have capitalized on this with influencer marketing and paid social media placements.If alkaline water is just a fad with no scientific basis, however, what about people like my friend Kate, who swear they feel its benefits?Well, says Dr Fenton, it’s possible that they’re drinking more water than they were before, which is not a bad thing. Also, she says, “have you heard of the placebo effect?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83f9d7445b3d7cc8a2c0599baa396ee7c6692612/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e5c5bdb949a73329da6574a3964386f","title":"complete guide to waking up feeling fantastic","story":"Now the clocks have gone back and the days are getting shorter, it can be hard to get out of bed. But, from dawn simulators to a regular wakeup time, here are 16 ways to start the day wellThere is nothing wrong with using your phone alarm – unless its other functions are interfering with your sleep. Several studies have indicated that greater phone use, particularly in the run-up to bedtime, results in worse quality sleep. The main reason is the light from screens altering the timing of the brain’s master clock, a cluster of cells that dictates the timing of all the other biological clocks in the body. Exposure to bright or blue-enriched light at night shifts its timing later, which means we feel tired later and our bodies are still in sleep mode when it is time to get up in the morning. Light also has a direct alerting effect on the brain, which makes it harder to fall asleep.If you do sleep with your phone, set it to night mode to filter out blue light and adjust the brightness setting to dim. Nick Littlehales, an elite sports sleep coach and the author of the book Sleep, says you should also switch it to silent and rest it on a soft surface to dampen any vibrations from incoming alerts.In an ideal world, we wouldn’t need alarm clocks we would simply go to bed when we felt tired and sleep until we were ready to wake up. However, the ubiquity of artificial light after dusk means that relying on when we feel sleepy to dictate our bedtimes isn’t very helpful. Our natural sleep rhythm has shifted later, yet most of us must wake up at a prescribed time to go to work or school, meaning our sleep is cut short. It also means that we often wake up when our bodies think it is still night-time, which increases feelings of “sleep inertia” – the grogginess you experience immediately upon waking. US researchers showed that when people were sent on a camping trip and denied access to their electronic gadgets, their circadian rhythms shifted about two hours earlier, which meant they felt sleepier earlier and got more sleep.That depends on your chronotype – your natural sleep-timing preference – which is hardwired in your genes. “It is not a choice and it is very difficult to change,” says Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Why We Sleep. Some people are larks and predisposed to wake up early, others are late types who naturally sleep in most of us lie somewhere in between. However, even night owls can become a little more lark-like if they reduce their exposure to light at night and seek out bright light from the moment they wake up, which pushes the master clock earlier. These innate sleep preferences also vary with age. Teenagers’ sleep timing typically shifts about two hours later, while as we get older, we become progressively more lark-like.More important than when you prefer to get up is consistency in the timing of your sleep. If you go to bed and wake up later at weekends, you are effectively giving yourself jet lag – and when your alarm clock wakes you at 7am on Monday, your body will still think it’s night-time. “The most important advice I can give people who are struggling with sleep, or want to get good-quality sleep, is to keep it regular,” says Walker.Yes, provided you go to sleep at about the same time every night and wake at the same time each morning, says Lisa Artis, an adviser for the Sleep Council. “Your internal body clock will strengthen and you will start to wake naturally at a time that suits you. However, if not setting an alarm is going to make you anxious about sleeping in and missing a train or an important meeting, you should set the alarm,” she adds. “Otherwise, you will spend most of your time in bed worrying you won’t get enough sleep.”Tempting as it may be to set your alarm a bit early so you can enjoy dozing in bed, there are good reasons why this is a bad idea. For one thing, “interrupted sleep is not good-quality sleep”, says Walker. The impact on your heart is another. Although setting an alarm may be necessary – and even a good thing, if it encourages regularity in the timing of your sleep – if you are repeatedly exposed to it, “you are literally alarming your heart”, he says. “Set the alarm for when you need to get up, then turn it off and get up.”Dawn simulators are often marketed as a gentler way to wake up, the idea being that gradual exposure to light may cause gentle stirring, which means we experience less sleep inertia when we wake. There is little direct evidence for this, but several studies have found improvements in people’s subjective alertness after being woken this way. In one such study, Dutch researchers compared people’s responses to being woken by a dawn simulator with a light being switched on at the same time as an alarm going off. “We saw that there was a faster reduction of sleepiness if people had this gradual increase in light prior to waking up,” says Marijke Gordijn at the University of Groningen. A study by Swiss researchers found that dawn simulation left people feeling and performing better all day.Exposure to light during the daytime may also improve the quality of your sleep. In a different study, Gordijn and her colleagues discovered that people who were exposed to more daylight had less fragmented and deeper sleep that night and reported feeling less sleepy the next morning.If you have trouble waking up in the mornings, having some light coming in through the windows may help. On the other hand, particularly in summer when it is light before 5am, this night-time light exposure can result in disturbed sleep. “It really is a balance between having the blinds drawn so one gets good sleep, versus getting light as soon as one wakes up,” says Nayantara Santhi, a circadian biologist at the Surrey sleep research centre at the University of Surrey in Guildford. If you do use blackout blinds or curtains, Santhi suggests opening them as soon as you get out of bed. Another option is to combine blackout blinds with a dawn-simulating clock.If you really need that kind of a motivation to get out of bed, it suggests you’re suffering from chronic sleep deprivation. Walker says: “Most people – as long as they are sleeping in synchrony with their body rhythms and getting sufficient sleep – should be able to wake up for the most part naturally, and require very little nudging. A normal alarm should do it.”Whatever you do, try to avoid turning on the lights. Bright light is a stimulant, like caffeine, so it will make it harder for you to fall back to sleep. And it will shift the timing of your circadian clocks, which could interfere with your sleep the next night – as well as making your other body systems work less efficiently. If a child has woken you and they need soothing, “try to do it in the dark or, if needs be, use a very dim light”, says Artis. Avoid looking at a clock. “Watching the sleepless minutes pass makes it harder to fall back to sleep, so turn the clock face so you can’t see it. And if your mind starts racing, try doing some simple relaxation or breathing exercises in bed,” she adds.A strategic nap in the afternoon is a good strategy. “By taking a nap, you reduce the hours of continuous wakefulness, which is one of the two main processes that contribute to sleepiness, the other being the circadian rhythm,” says Cassie Hilditch, a fatigue countermeasures researcher at the San Jose State University Research Foundation in California. “Napping in the afternoon is recommended over napping in the evening, as the evening tends to be when we are most alert. In the afternoon, however, you can take advantage of the body’s natural dip in alertness, which makes it easier to nap.”Caffeine can also be strategically deployed to boost alertness – but only use as needed, to avoid building up a tolerance to it. And it should be avoided towards the end of the night shift, as “it has a long half-life so could interfere with recovery sleep the next day”, Hilditch adds.“There are lots of claims about how certain bedding and pyjamas can help sleep but, honestly, I don’t think there is sufficient enough evidence to say if they do or don’t, so I would say it’s down to personal preference,” says Artis. You don’t want to be too hot or too cold, because both can affect the quality of your sleep.It can certainly affect how easy it is to fall asleep in the evening – a room temperature of 16C-17C is considered ideal. “Your body temperature needs to drop to initiate and then maintain sleep,” says Walker. This is why bed socks or a hot-water bottle by your feet can help you to fall asleep: they cause the blood vessels in your skin to open up and shed heat.The opposite seems to be true for waking up, however. Body temperature reaches its nadir during the early hours of the morning, then rises progressively throughout the day. Several studies suggest that the reduction in sleepiness we experience after we wake up is mirrored by a transfer of heat from the extremities to the core. There is no research into whether stepping on to a cold floor increases the transition to wakefulness, but there is reason to think it might. “If you lower your skin temperature, it may help to wake you up,” says Gordijn.You don’t want your house to be too cold in the mornings, however, as your body is now trying to raise its temperature. Setting the thermostat to come on shortly before waking may aid this, says Walker it may also help explain why people crave a warm drink in the morning.“There is nothing inherently wrong with needing a good cup of coffee in the morning,” says Artis. “But what you have to ask yourself is: why do you need it to feel awake and alert?” If you are only able to function with a shot of coffee inside you, the chances are you’re not sleeping properly, so you should try and examine why that is. “If you need caffeine to function before 10 or 11 o’clock in the morning, you are probably self-medicating a state of sleep deprivation,” Walker adds.

Richards is the only player to have won the title more than once, and he also took the French Scrabble title for the second time earlier this year.The victory came after a marathon 36 games in a week of knockouts involving 116 players representing 25 countries. The final was fought at in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, to mark the board game’s 70th anniversary.The youngest player to compete was nine-year old Muhammad Misbah Ur Rehman from Pakistan. Brett Smitheram, the 2016 champion, was the highest ranking Briton, finishing fourth.After defeating Day by 575 to 452, Richards, who described his opponent as “impressive”, posed for photographs with the winning board and the glass trophy.“I am absolutely thrilled,” he said, barely cracking a smile. Day, who dwarfed his much smaller runners-up trophy at the photocall, nevertheless managed a much broader grin.Scrabble fans took photographs as Richards and Day faced off in a best-of-five final, which organisers described as “nail-biting”.Day said: “Nigel has an extraordinary vocabulary, the best in the world. I was pretty impressed by his play of ‘zonular’ for 100 at the start of a game. It put him at a major advantage in round two.”Among other high-scoring words in the final were “maledict”, meaning to “utter a curse against”, played by Day for 95 points in the fourth round, and “phenolic”, for 84 points, meaning “a synthetic resin”, played by Richards in round two.The precursor to Scrabble was invented in 1938 by Alfred Mosher Butts, a US architect, who originally marketed it as Criss-Crosswords. Ten years later, an original owner of Criss-Crosswords, James Brunot, bought the rights to the game, slightly changed the rules and renamed it Scrabble."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb2b30fa74b9aa833fc86cef2012cb9ec35f1c6d/0_24_4683_2810/master/4683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09525c4b1174948beb907c5a7e6f894a","title":"kanye west designs clothing candace owens blexit","story":"The designs appear on merchandise for conservative commentator Candace Owens’s ‘Blexit’ campaignKanye West has reportedly designed a line of apparel for a conservative campaign encouraging black Americans to quit the Democratic party.

West has been a vocal supporter of Donald Trump since the 2016 election campaign. He recently visited Trump inside the Oval Office, ostensibly to discuss prison reform – an issue his wife, Kim Kardashian West, has previously discussed at the White House.Surrounded by reporters and cameras, West launched into an impassioned stream of consciousness touching on race relations, tax breaks, criminal justice and mental health. He described the red “Make America Great Again” baseball cap on his head as “a superhero cape”.West’s Blexit designs were unveiled at the Young Black Leadership Summit held this weekend by Turning Point USA, the conservative advocacy group of which Owens is director of communications. West was not present at the event.West recently donated $73,540 to Chicago mayoral candidate Amara Enyia as she launched a campaign to take over from the incumbent, Rahm Emanuel.

Talent is spread evenly and the challenge with Britain is that opportunity isn’t and that’s what we have got to fix.”Her comments will fuel ongoing speculation about the prime minister’s future, as the number of MPs backing a leadership contest is believed to be close to the threshold of 48 necessary to trigger a vote. Many of those MPs are known to be hard Brexiters disgruntled with what they see as May’s concessions to the EU.If she ran as leader, Greening would hope to draw support from the other wing of the party and the majority of Tory MPs who backed remain in the referendum.Greening resigned from the government after being offered the post of work and pensions secretary in May’s January reshuffle.Since leaving the cabinet she has been outspoken about the need for the Tories to broaden their appeal to younger, more socially liberal voters. In June, she ruled herself out of the running to be the Conservatives’ candidate for mayor of London.She told ITV: “We need a guarantee on opportunity for people in country in the same way that we tried to give them guarantees on health … I didn’t have a life mission to come into politics. I just want to see change on the ground, it is as simple as that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6379cb0c0d8fdbf5b46af15b0c5db7d536c6a176/0_14_2414_1448/master/2414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e013d5ed81d49562df1f25939f16e3","title":"twitter users mint new jokes over brexit 50p coin","story":"Mooted plans for special coin to mark UK leaving EU spark derision on social mediaChancellors are renowned for trying to spring a surprise during their budget speeches, and Philip Hammond is expected to announce that the UK will mint a special celebratory coin to mark the UK’s departure from the European Union.The Brexit 50p is expected to be issued on 29 March next year, the day the country is due to leave the bloc after 45 years of membership. According to reports, the coin will bear the phrase “Friendship With All Nations”.The report was greeted with derision on social media from Hammond’s opponents. In a reference to the continued devaluation of sterling, Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, posted a picture of a pound coin. It wasn’t long before the jokes started on social media, as others soon found images they thought might be a more appropriate metaphor for Brexit to display on a coin:And others thought, given the progress with negotiations, the wording might need changing.The phrase expected to be on the coin is rather pointed but isn’t especially British. It is a truncated version of a quote from the former US president Thomas Jefferson, who said: “Peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none.”Some suggested that perhaps the new coinage could be made more memorable by adopting a unique and appropriate shape.As more and more people re-imagined the Brexit 50p, a favourite phrase from the sitcom Dad’s Army sprang to the mind of one social media user.And another suggested this alternative, with an eloquently written description: “One side features the Queen with her head in her hand, quietly sobbing, while the other has a comprehensive list of the benefits the people of the UK will receive on leaving the EU.”That side of the coin is left blank.The UK is definitely striking it out alone with the plan, as the move to celebrate Brexit with a coin will not be echoed across the channel. The EU has already said it has no plans to mint a special euro coin to mark Brexit. “We have no current plans to do anything of the sort,” said a European commission spokesperson.In 1998 the Treasury issued a special 50p coin to celebrate the UK’s presidency of the EU and 25 years of membership of the EU. The UK also issued a commemorative 50p in 1973 to mark joining the EEC.The move to celebrate Brexit in this way may be ultimately self-defeating.

Smith was handed a 12-month ban, Bancroft nine months and Warner – who was identified as the ringleader – a 12-month ban and a guarantee that he would never hold a leadership role with the national team.The 147-page report, produced by the the Ethics Centre, was scathing of CA.“The most common description of CA is as ‘arrogant’ and ‘controlling’,” it said. “The core complaint is that the organisation does not respect anyone other than its own. Players feel that they are treated as commodities.“Australian cricket has lost its balance ... and has stumbled badly. The reputation of the game of cricket, as played by men, has been tainted. Women’s cricket remains unaffected.“The ball-tampering incident at the Newlands Ground in South Africa can be seen as an aberration ... However, to think this would be mistaken. We have seen evidence that the structures built around elite cricket are oriented to winning, without properly counting the cost.”The report was also critical of the widespread use of sledging . It said the drive to win meant players were frequently asked to “play the mongrel”.The Cricket Australia chairman, David Peever, said he accepted responsibility for what happened in South Africa.“We wanted to know what was wrong and what we could do better,” he said. “We voluntarily commissioned the review because we wanted to look in the mirror.”But he rejected calls to resign and said he was “looking forward immensely” to the future of Australian cricket.Test captain Tim Paine, who replaced Smith, said he understood the findings of the review into players’ on-field behaviour that led to the establishment of a players’ charter.The Players’ Pact will become “the overarching statement as to how cricketers in Australia should play the game, respecting its traditions”.Paine said he was not surprised the report found players “lived in a bubble”.“Potentially we got a little bit wrapped up in our own self-importance. We are the lucky ones playing for Australia. It’s not our cricket team, it’s Australia’s cricket team and I think for a little while we lost that.”But he would not be drawn on whether the report should lead to leniency for his former teammates.“I don’t think it’s about blame so much. I think everyone has admitted over the last 12 months that there have been mistakes made. To sit here and blame people isn’t going to help anyone.”Peever said the sanctions for the three players would stand.It also recommends that the award of the Allan Border medal take into account character and behaviour as well as performance, and that selectors take into account a player’s character as well as their skills when picking teams.The report also recommends that the role of vice-captain “be de-coupled from that of ‘heir apparent’ for the captaincy”, and that the player’s anti-harassment code be modified to ban abusive sledging.Cricket Australia has fully supported 34 of the recommendations, is considering seven, and rejected one, which would excuse players from international T20 to play Sheffield Shield and grade cricket.Many sections of the report were redacted. Cricket Australia said this was due to defamation risk, at the advice of external lawyers, due to the honesty of the review."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e787b2324f00393ad58f17cc624a4d3e3a47a9e7/0_35_2200_1319/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35812b8f2c6da59938356e3e279d1b51","title":"lewis hamilton f1 legends his way imitation grand prix","story":"Mercedes maestro has complimented his adherence to grand prix track etiquette with a trail-blazing love of rap music and fashion designAs Lewis Hamilton has just discovered, five is a magical number in motor racing. It means one thing and one thing only. It is the number of times Juan Manuel Fangio won the drivers’ world championship in Formula One between 1951 and 1957. For almost half a century, that feat looked as likely to be equalled as Don Bradman’s Test average. Like the Australian genius, the Argentinian maestro enjoyed an eminence setting him apart not just from his contemporaries but from those who preceded and those who followed his era.So statistics are fun but they do not tell the story. They do not describe the conditions in which Fangio raced, in death-trap cars on circuits lined with trees, ditches and houses, wearing highly flammable cotton shirts and trousers and eggshell helmets made of layers of linen soaked in shellac. In those days, racing drivers were like Spitfire pilots. Every time they went out, there was a good chance someone – probably one of their close friends, because that is the way drivers were then – would not come back.Which is not to minimise anything Schumacher did in terms of his sheer brilliance as a driver. And that is the point. To see him taking his Ferrari through Silverstone’s Copse Corner flat out in top gear was just as thrilling an experience as anything to be seen in Fangio’s era. The conditions in which the drivers work today are very different but the job requirements – courage, naturally, but also skill, commitment and a freakish level of spatial and sensory awareness – are much the same. And whereas Fangio raced at a time when the season consisted only of seven or eight races, Schumacher was required to gear himself up for 20 races a year plus a schedule of endless development work.So it is with Hamilton, whose fifth title, secured in Mexico City on Sunday, put him level with Fangio and two behind Schumacher. It was good to see the British driver acknowledge the statistical significance of his achievement by showing respect for the man with whom he shares the number five his years with Mercedes-Benz, where Fangio won two of his titles, will not have left him in ignorance of the great Argentinian’s unique standing.In my experience, your average armchair Formula One fan finds it hard to see the real Hamilton. Many of those with a much closer view, the people who populate the grand prix paddock, had a similar problem when he first appeared. His mixed-race background made him an object of curiosity but when he started wearing diamond ear studs and bringing his rapper friends into the pits there was a distinct feeling he was not, to put it crudely, One Of Us. The 2011 season, in which he let his emotional life undermine his concentration, left an impression of surliness.But to have been the Jack Johnson (first black world heavyweight champ), the Althea Gibson (first black Wimbledon champion), the Frank Worrell (first black captain of West Indies) or the Viv Anderson (first black footballer to play for England) of what was previously a very white sport imposed its own pressures. In one sense that achievement is arguably more significant than whatever statistics end up next to his name.It is equally important to recognise he did it by being himself. Rather than imitating the cultural norms of the world in which he has excelled, he has explored his interest in rap music and fashion design, forging ahead with plans that may lead him to a productive second career after racing, rather than ending up, as so many do, back in the paddock holding a TV microphone.In another way, however, he is a throwback. As a child he idolised Ayrton Senna but without absorbing the sense of entitlement that trashed a code of etiquette formulated when the drivers had each other’s lives in their hands. Unlike some contemporaries who also fell under the Brazilian’s spell, he tends not to drive into other people when he fails to get his own way. He is a scrupulously clean driver as well as a superlatively fast one, the years having tempered his natural aggression with the maturity that lay behind his decision to let Max Verstappen take the lead into the first corner in Mexico, knowing a collision with the hot-headed young Dutchman would defer his chance of taking the title.There are many things to dislike about modern Formula One, but – for this and other reasons – Lewis Hamilton is not among them.

It will still have a power button and volume buttons, but will lack a home button, instead relying on facial recognition for unlocking the device. It will not have a notch into the screen like Apple’s new iPhones, however.The new tablet is also expected to embrace the USB-C connector, replacing the long-standing Lightning connector that has been used in the iPhone and iPad since 2012.All of Apple’s Mac computers released since April 2015 have shipped with at least one USB-C port, with the MacBook and MacBook Pro shunning all other ports for the multipurpose connector.The new iPad is also expected have a new version of Apple’s A12 Bionic processor, as found in the 2018 iPhones, and may have a new graphics chip.Apple will hope the that refreshed iPad Pro with greater PC-like capabilities, including the versatility of the USB-C connector, will boost sales of the tablet against growing competition from Windows 10 2-in-1 hybrids such as Microsoft’s Surface Pro and Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 tablet that aim to perform both tablet and laptop duties.Apple is also expected to update its Mac computer line with new processors and some updated designs. Despite its popularity, the MacBook Air was last updated in early 2015 with fifth-generation Intel Core chips with 8GB of RAM made standard in 2017, and is still on sale with those old components.Ever since the introduction of the new 12in MacBook in 2015, Apple has been expected to either drop the MacBook Air from sale or update it.Rumours predict that the MacBook Air will see a redesign with an improved screen and newer seventh or eighth-generation Intel Core chips bringing it into line with Apple’s other computers.Apple’s smallest desktop computer, the Mac Mini, has not seen an update since 2014 and is still sold with fourth-generation Intel Core chips. The Mac Mini is expected to either be dropped from sale or updated with new chips similar to the MacBook Air.The iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro without Touch Bar are currently sold with seventh-generation Intel Core chips, and are anticipated to see updates to the newer eighth-generation components at some point in the near future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfc662dad7f066f42c3955e0dfa1c46d59fb066e/0_57_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3d6de93fc08c02f0560d62ff011f2ef3 1240w","title":"john oliver fox news last week tonight","story":"The Last Week Tonight host criticised the network for promoting unconfirmed conspiracy theories over the spate of pipe bombsJohn Oliver has criticised Fox News over the network’s decision to push unconfirmed conspiracy theories in their coverage of the Florida mail bomb suspect.On his HBO show Last Week Tonight, Oliver started with a summary of a “particularly grim” week in the US, including a spate of mail bombs sent to high-profile critics of the president.“It has been a time of sober reflection or if you’re Fox News discussing those package bombs, a time for wild speculation,” he said. “Because before the suspect was even arrested, they were giving airtime to a truly ludicrous theory.”Before the suspect had been identified, the network was giving airtime to pundits and “experts” who claimed that the situation sounded like a false-flag operation, a hoax launched by Democrats.Geraldo Rivera was one of those pushing this theory, prefacing it by saying he didn’t want to sound like a “far-right lunatic” – something that amused Oliver.“Sounding like a far-right lunatic is not really a risk for the Fox News brand, is it?” Oliver said. “It’s more of a guarantee.”After the identity of the bomber was revealed, along with his obsession with the president and hatred of his enemies, Rivera tweeted that he had “outsmarted” himself with his earlier guess.“Outsmarted myself is a brilliant way of saying you did something stupid,” Oliver said. “Wow, I really outsmarted myself this morning when I accidentally ate kitty litter instead of grape nuts.”Oliver then spoke about Saudi Arabia, “the country with bans on pork, alcohol and porn – or, as it’s known in America, a Florida breakfast”.The death of Jamal Khashoggi has continued to raise questions, and Saudi officials have released a string of increasingly unlikely explanations. Last week saw a statement that claimed Khashoggi had died after a disagreement. “Apparently it started when they had a disagreement over whether or not Khashoggi should be murdered in cold blood,” Oliver said.He said that the “horrific situation has put Trump in a very difficult position” before calling Trump’s recent statement “very, very weird”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aa5ba7ca3e904e8d1d9f16a7c9838b69f709412/0_104_4284_2572/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1442b94f47eb75c8be588181447cb93","title":"the little drummer girl review what is real john le carre","story":"Park Chan-wook’s adaptation of the Le Carré classic sees the Korean auteur take The Night Manager’s globetrotting appeal and better it with gripping espionageI’ve realised that I have the same problem with John le Carré thrillers as I did with The Americans: I don’t understand where reality leaves off and fiction begins. You should have seen my face when it was confirmed for me that there really were – ARE!?!!? – Russian sleeper agents strewn across the US, ready to overthrow the evil of capitalism the moment the fax came through. I mean, it’s insane. But, apparently, true.I’ve always shelved spies in much the same category as King Arthur. Some tiny grain of truth somewhere along the way providing a storytelling opportunity too good to miss and here we are: a mythology so irresistible that we are happy to cleave to it as fact. I no more think of James Bond as a glamourised, ironised take on reality than I think of Spiderman as a Hollywood version of real arachni-heroes. He’s just another offshoot of the tale we tell. As for Philby and Co – well. I vaguely presumed that they were people who had forgotten what lies they told at their entrance interviews and that the situation just kind of ran away from them after that.Espionage. Counterespionage. Where would you find the energy, the motivation? People don’t really get that worked up about their countries, do they? Ah, but here is where even the thickest carapace of ignorance must begin to crack and let a little light shine in. Because, of course, as even the most unwilling of us have learned over the last few elections and referendums, they do.And the most potent example of it is at the heart of the latest Le Carré adaptation. The Little Drummer Girl, whose six-part run began on Sunday night (brought to us by the same people who gave us The Night Manager two years ago, though its lavish, stylish direction comes courtesy of Korean auteur Park Chan-wook) begins with a bomb exploding in the house of an Israeli attache in West Germany, missing him by chance but killing his eight-year-old son. The bomb was planted by a young woman working as part of a network of cells operated by a brilliant and elusive Palestinian named Khalil. It provides the cue for Martin Kurtz (played by the estimable Michael Shannon), the head of a team of Israeli spies working clandestinely – like, even for spies – to step up his mission to find Khalil and stop him. I suspect not by asking him politely.In order to fight fire with fire, Kurtz deems it necessary to recruit a young woman for their side too. I was going to say “slightly implausibly” but again – see The Americans above – I really don’t know. Is it? Should we be marvelling at the accuracy of the rendering of history or at the brio with which nonsense is being made credible and compelling?Whichever way we choose, we can all be grateful for it bringing Charlie into the game. She is played by Florence Pugh with such authentic pugnacity, compressed energy and intelligence that were she not surrounded by such stalwarts as Shannon and – soon to come – Alexander Skarsgård she would be in danger of making everyone else look like a bloodless cipher.Charlie is an actor on a working holiday in Greece with her castmates, paid for by their new anonymous patron. There they are approached by and befriend – you know what actors are like, basically fools – a strange, scarred man called Joseph (Skarsgård in a part that puts to perfect use his strangely ethereal charisma and persistent undertow of melancholy). She alone is suspicious, noticing among other things that he hums a tune unique to the show they did in London before they left.Eventually, and via that rarest of phenomena, a plentiful array of scenes during which they test each other and forge a convincing, idiosyncratic relationship instead of one that simply relies on her being a Hot Young Actor and him looking like Alexander Skarsgård, she agrees to a sort-of date. At the end of it she discovers that her acting ability, ferocious memory and potentially sympathetic politics have made her ideal recruiting material for Kurtz, rather than girlfriend material for Joseph. While he has been seducing her, the rest of the team have been surveilling Khalil’s younger brother Salim – and from next week, the hunt is on.It’s all brilliantly, beautifully done and the dialogue sounds as good as everything else looks. By the end of the hour you’re more firmly recruited than Charlie is. Do I know what is real and what is not? Do I know where to position myself at the border between fact and fiction? I do not. Let Le Carré and his team determine my truth.

Everyone here knows the office. It has stood for decades and is owned by the reservation tribal government. But one thing about it has remained a mystery: its address.Until recently that would hardly have mattered. Many properties, from government buildings to small homes, have no formal street address. Members of the Lakota Sioux tribe who live on Standing Rock, like the Native Americans on four other reservations in North Dakota, just know where people live. Most residents use PO Boxes to collect their mail. For years, thousands have used their PO Boxes when registering formal identification documents.Now, with less than two weeks left before the crucial midterm elections, that poses a problem some fear could change the outcome in a pivotal race.Following a supreme court decision earlier in the month, North Dakota’s voter ID laws will go into effect in November. That means voters will be forced to show ID documents that include a full address before they can cast a ballot. The Republican-backed law has been branded a deliberate attempt to suppress the Native American vote.“They proposed this legislation and never invited us to be at the table,” said Danielle Ta’Sheena Finn, Standing Rock’s external affairs director. “We were not invited to propose comments or questions or concerns. It was done almost under the rug, which tells you the intent.”Inside the unnamed yellow building, the small army of volunteers, brought together by a coalition of Native civil rights groups, are determined to fight back. They plan to knock on every single door in the northern side of this vast reservation, which straddles North and South Dakota, and bus people to the single government building issuing new tribal ID cards until all Standing Rock’s population has the documentation required.It is a mammoth task, in an open place where 3,000 eligible voters live in communities dotted around 1,128 square miles of land.Alva Cottonwood-Gabe sat in the office, her old tribal ID card in her hand. It expired years ago but the 57-year-old, who lives on $393 a month in food stamps and other government subsistence, simply could not afford to pay $5 to replace it.“I’ve got four grandchildren to support and I need it to pay for other things in the home,” she said.Following the supreme court decision, tribal governments in all of North Dakota’s reservations moved to waive the fee for new documents – soaking up the costs themselves. Cottonwood-Gabe was among the first to be bussed in to collect her new ID, which she brandished above her head, a small marker of victory. It was identical to her previous ID card, bar a single line that noted her address was 568 Sioux Avenue.The laborious process, which involved three forms and a queue at the federal office, was a reminder to her of what she believed was the new law’s true intent.“They are trying to suppress our vote because they don’t want to hear what we have to say,” she said. “But voting is so important, not just for me but for my children, my grandchildren, my great grandchildren.”A mother of 13 and grandmother of 20, Cottonwood-Gabe is a veteran of the pipeline protests that commanded international attention in 2016. She was maced three times in clashes with police and left partially deaf in one ear, after authorities used sound cannons.She has lived in Standing Rock her whole life and voted in every election since 1984. Environmental protection, she said, was the issue that concerned her the most at this year’s election.The battle for the US Senate seat in North Dakota is among the most crucial races in the midterms. Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp faces Republican congressman Kevin Cramer in an election that could be decided by just a few thousand votes. If Democrats cannot hold the seat, it will be almost impossible for them to take the Senate. Heitkamp, who voted against Donald Trump’s controversial supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, currently trails in the polls.Almost immediately after Heitkamp was elected, Republicans in the state legislature passed the voter ID law. Following court rulings that initially blocked it, 2018 will be the first election the law is in full effect.Cramer, an arch-conservative, has like other Republicans in the state argued the law is vital to protect against voter fraud. At a debate last week he suggested there was no discriminatory effect and accused the law’s critics of playing “identity politics”.North Dakota, the only state in the union that does not require iniduals to register before they vote, has prosecuted just one case of voter fraud in decades. According to the Standing Rock tribal council, there has never been a cases of voter fraud in Sioux county, the jurisdiction that covers all of Standing Rock’s territory in the state.For some the new laws were a further reminder of the state’s racist past, in which it legally disenfranchised most of Native voters. At the turn of the 20th century North Dakota’s constitution gave the right to vote only to “civilised persons of Indian descent” who had ended their ties to tribal government. Like the Jim Crow laws of the south, the discrimination was formally ended with the passing of the 1965 Voting Rights Act – a defining achievement of the civil rights movement.But since a 2013 supreme court decision weakened key provisions of that law, the voting rights of minority groups like Native Americans have come under frequent attack.Standing at the top of a hill that overlooked Fort Yates, as autumn leaves swirled in the wind, Chase Iron Eyes looked out over his childhood home.“This history that we have here is not set up to honour us as human beings or honour our right to participate in democracy,” he said.“The government didn’t need a physical address to come and steal our children for boarding school. The government didn’t need a physical address when it was time for us to be conscripted into their militaries. But now they need a physical address so that we can exercise one of the most basic principles and tenets of a representative democracy.”“Every election is such a beast. There’s got to be an organized, consistent effort to get our people – disempowered, disenfranchised oppressed people – to give a shit about their destiny. That’s a hard thing to do.”Over the two days of door knocking observed by the , dozens of Standing Rock residents said they had already been out to collect new ID documents. But canvassers were concerned by a few incidents that illustrated the strict requirements now in place.Residents were being told to fill in their forms in blue ink: clerks at the county offices had rejected applications written in black and green. One Standing Rock resident, Dale Ramsey, had his application for a new ID rejected as he had previously listed an address outside the reservation on a separate document. (He had been homeless at the time and so registered at a shelter outside Standing Rock.) As it stood, he would not be able to vote.The tribe were also concerned that two out of the five polling stations inside the reservation would only be open from midday on election day – the other three will be open from 9am.Volunteers were encouraging voters to cast their ballot early, at the county courthouse, by applying in person for an absentee ballot and handing it straight back with the vote cast. But the tiny offices there were burdened with other municipal duties too.Out in the remote settlement town of Selfridge, 34-year-old Honorata Defender and three other volunteers were knocking on doors. On one dusty street, 81-year-old James Cowry opened the door, surprised to be receiving visitors.He had lived in his home for three decades and had never known its formal address. The volunteers told him to call the local 911 coordinator, who would give him the information. But he had still not decided whether to vote.“I don’t feel for the candidates either way,” he said.Defender vowed to come back and drive him 30 miles down the road to pick up his ID card later in the week.“Every vote should count,” she said. “I’ll do all that I can to help you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places.

She said on Monday she has made the decision before the summer recess and had planned to announce it next week.The 64-year-old has been CDU chairwoman since 2000 and chancellor since 2005. Merkel’s presumed favoured successor is the CDU secretary general, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who announced her candidacy on Monday, but Merkel declined to back her, saying she did not want to influence the election.German media reported that Friedrich Merz, a former parliamentary leader of the CDUCSU alliance, was also joining the race to succeed Merkel. Other favourites are the health minister Jens Spahn and the state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet.The CDU general secretary is a staunch centrist, Merkel loyalist and the favourite to succeed her. The 56-year-old former premier of Saarland, who also goes by her initials AKK, is also thought to be Merkel’s preference\u0026nbsp to continue her work of modernising the party. Considered a pragmatist, Kramp-Karrenbauer was a quiet supporter of Merkel’s migration policy but has expressed reservations about marriage and adoption rights for same sex couples. Her intention to stand as CDU leader was reportedly met with applause from party colleagues.At 38, the German health minister is the youngest contender to succeed Merkel. Openly gay, he is firmly to the right of Merkel and has described himself as a “burqaphobe.” He has also warned against “putting the boot into Britain” over Brexit. Perhaps the harshest critic of Merkel’s migration policy within the CDU, Spahn has made a name for himself with his combative style but, it seems, it might not have made him many friends. In contrast to Kramp-Karrenbauer, his intention to stand was reportedly met with deathly silence from party colleagues.Merkel\u0027s old party rival was the first to announce he would stand to replace her. Back in Back in 2002, the dual party leaders (Merz was head of the CDUCSU parliamentary bloc) had clashed over the latter\u0027s\u0026nbsp suggested slimming down of the tax system and his calls for a “German dominant culture.” Merkel pushed him out of office and out of politics altogether until recent rumours of a comeback for the\u0026nbsp 62-year-old.The 57-year-old state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia and devout Catholic sits to the right of Merkel on migration, religion and family issues. In the past he has waded into debates about the role of Islam in Germany and has been a staunch opponent of same sex marriage as well as Germany’s military foreign interventions. He is thought to be close to the liberal FDP on energy policy.Traditionally, the person who holds position of party chair of the government’s largest party also takes position of chancellor, but this is not a binding rule. Previously Merkel has said the two jobs belong together.Merkel’s predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, made the same move in February 2004, giving up the position of chairman but remaining chancellor until November 2005. At the time, Merkel, who was then leader of the opposition, spoke of a “loss of authority all along the line”, and “the beginning of the end” of Schröder.Christian Lindner, the leader of the liberal FDP party, was the first to demand Merkel’s resignation as chancellor on the back of the news, calling for her ruling conservative bloc to “be prepared for a real new beginning in Germany”.Merkel’s CDU allies, however, seem ready to accept her decision to stay on as chancellor for now. The former president of the German parliament Norbert Lammert told Die Welt it was acceptable as part of a “transition phase”, whereas the head of the CDU in the German state of Thuringia, Mike Mohring, spoke of a “turning point”. Others greeted the chance for renewal in the party.After news of Merkel’s decision not to stand for re-election as leader of the CDU, Nahles ruled out a change in leadership in her party. “A personnel configuration is not being discussed in the SPD,” she told journalists on Monday morning.The euro fell to session lows on Monday. Merkel’s weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in the EU at a time when the bloc is dealing with Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist parties making gains at European parliament elections next May.The trouncing for the German coalition parties on Sunday came shortly after a disastrous result in Bavaria, widely seen as a protest against the failings of the Berlin government. The Hesse result will be seen as further evidence of the shrinking of the mainstream political landscape across Germany and Europe more widely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f71366dc093803243b0bc5e980e7ecf85f403583/0_92_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c72240dd48b27cdd21e525c89e69c5a","title":"canada greyhound bus ending urban rural","story":"Longstanding bus routes will see their last journeys this month, mirroring the region’s struggles: ‘Those who remain are unable to leave’by Will Doig in Swan RiverIt’s 10 to midnight when the Winnipeg-bound Greyhound bus swings off of the empty highway and into a dirt lot illuminated by a single street lamp.Its headlights sweep across the only passenger waiting in this remote lumber town: Mary Reimer, 80, is bundled in a purple parka against the cold.“Since my husband passed away four years ago, this is how I get to my sister,” she says, before climbing aboard.It’s the last time she’ll make the journey this way.Amid cratering passenger figures, Greyhound will discontinue all service in Canada’s western provinces on 31 October. The cuts will eliminate routes that have existed for nearly a century and sever the only transit link for dozens of towns where the British-owned company has endured even as other businesses have trickled away.Some analysts see it as yet another indicator that rural Canada is not only struggling, but slowly decoupling from the country’s thriving urban cores.Don Warkentin has witnessed these changes. After 34 years driving Greyhound buses between Winnipeg and the mining city of Flin Flon eleven hours north, he’ll retire next week along with his route.One of 415 employees phased out by the cuts, he remembers when Greyhound made three runs a day on this stretch, with 24-hour depots at each stop. Now there’s one bus nightly, and most stops are bare-bones roadside pull-offs like this one. “Not as many people are riding these days,” he says, pushing Reimer’s luggage into the undercarriage. “It’s an Uber culture now.”For those that can’t afford an Uber or the high cost of gas, Greyhound’s decision to write off much of the Canadian frontier is more than an inconvenience.“Greyhound is a private company, but they were almost public transportation in terms of the service they provided,” says Cathy Sproule, a member of the New Democratic party congress in Saskatchewan.The decline of Greyhound’s Canadian service reflects the story of rural Canada itself.“We see a confluence of events happening,” says Laura Neidhart, spokesperson for the advocacy group Canada Without Poverty. “More and more people are leaving rural Canada, and the people who remain are often the ones who are unable to leave.” Since 1950, the rural share of the country’s population has fallen by half.This is evident in Mafeking, a wisp of a town north of Swan River that’s speckled with boarded-up shops. At the Tempo gas station, the clerk Karina Kryzanowski says she hasn’t ridden the bus since the 1980s, in part because it passes through town in the middle of the night, and passengers have to stand on the road to flag it down – a daunting prospect on a desolate highway in the boreal forest.Today, over one-third of Canadians live in Toronto, Vancouver, or Montreal, a dramatic shift from when Greyhound Canada launched in British Columbia in 1929.Back then, mining and farming towns dotted the country’s vast interior.Too isolated for the private sector to bother with, many of their services – insurance coverage and even liquor stores – were furnished by the government. These “crown corporations” also provided transportation, including taxpayer-funded bus lines.Some of these lines still operate today. Ontario Northland, for instance, is a bus line financed by the province that links Toronto with tiny outposts 10 hours north-west. A product of Canada’s 20th-century democratic-socialist heyday, the state-run bus lines were founded on the presumption that integrating rural and urban regions benefits both.That presumption is now being challenged. The starkest example is the Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC), a 72-year-old state-run bus line that was shuttered last year by the province’s ruling Conservatives.“It was a total shock,” says Cindy Hanson, an organizer with Stop the Cuts, an advocacy group for public services in the province. “They did it so quickly there was no time to protest.”Growing up on a farm in Saskatchewan, Hanson remembers her dad receiving machine parts on the STC buses. “They came through twice a day, so it was faster and cheaper than any other shipping method,” she says. When the STC shut down last year, 253 communities were directly daffected, according to Hanson.Afterward, 10 private bus companies stepped in to replace the lost STC routes. Within a year, all but two had walked away, unable to turn a meaningful profit.“The idea behind the crown corporations is that they’re expected to operate in some areas at a loss,” says Hanson.Canada now finds itself in a tight spot. “There’s a real urban-rural dilemma,” says Barry Prentice, a professor of supply chain management at the University of Manitoba. As remote towns depopulate, services are scaled back, compelling even more residents to leave. “For those who don’t have friends or family to help them, the only solution is to move to the city,” he says.At the same time, Canada’s resource-based economy makes this a perilous cycle. “Forestry, mining, oil and gas – you can’t do these things from downtown Toronto,” says Prentice.But you can do them with far fewer people – insulating city dwellers from realizing the effects of rural decline, says Bill Reimer, professor emeritus at Concordia University.This gulf perpetuates itself, both culturally and politically. “Until maybe 20 or 30 years ago, most people in urban areas had rural roots, and that included policymakers,” says Reimer.This disconnect is one that Earl Mund, a cattle and grain farmer from Langenburg, Saskatchewan, feels acutely.At 81, he doesn’t mind the 11-hour bus trip to Edmunton to visit his daughters. What he minds is the seeming indifference of lawmakers to an issue that affects rural communities uniquely.“A lot of people in my town rely on the bus,” says Mund, exhaling steam in the early morning sun on a stopover in Saskatoon. “I think it’s a kind of discrimination. I’ll probably visit my daughters less often now. Maybe I won’t be able to visit them at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a07503dfb1bab279b54e8c9d5cbcc9771837bbf/0_147_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d0546c6dbc98a0c475a4a7941b445d","title":"lion air plane lost contact indonesia flight jt610 jakarta","story":"Communication lost with Lion Air plane carrying 189 people minutes after takeoffA passenger plane carrying 189 people has crashed into the sea off Jakarta minutes after taking off on a domestic flight to an Indonesian tin-mining region.Lion Air flight JT610, travelling from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang on the island of Bangka, lost contact with air traffic control about 13 minutes after it took off, shortly after its pilot had asked to return to base. Flight data showed it made a sudden, sharp e into the sea.Officials said human remains had been recovered from the crash site, about nine miles (15km) off the coast, and that they did not expect to find survivors.The plane was a Boeing 737 Max 8 jet, a new model that was launched globally only last year. The specific plane had been in use for less than three months. Lion Air’s chief executive, Edward Sirait, told reporters the plane had suffered “a technical issue” on Sunday night but engineers had cleared it to fly on Monday morning.“This plane previously flew from Denpasar to Jakarta,” he said. “There was a report of a technical issue which had been resolved according to procedure.”Sirait did not elaborate on the specific issue, and said he had no plans to ground the rest of Lion Air’s Max 8 fleet. The airline operates 11 of the Boeing planes.On Monday rescuers released footage of debris and personal items floating in the water at the crash site, including handbags, clothing, mobile phones, ID cards and driving licences.Dozens of ers from the national search and rescue agency and the military were working to retrieve the bodies of victims.At Soekarno-Hatta airport in Jakarta, relatives arrived at the airport crisis centre, many too distressed to talk to the media.Tugi, a Jakarta resident, came to inquire about his friend Wendy. “I came to try and get some information but they can’t give us any answers,” he said. “They don’t know yet, so I am going home and will monitor the media reports from there.”Forensics officers have told family members of those on board they can assist with the identification process by providing medical and dental records at the police hospital in East Jakarta.About 20 of the 189 people onboard were Indonesian finance department officials who had travelled to Jakarta for a conference. Three children, two of them infants, and eight crew members were also among those on board.A statement from Indonesia’s search and rescue agency said the aircraft’s emergency locator transmitter had not sent out a distress signal despite being certified to work until August 2019.The plane went down in waters about 30-35 metres (98-115 ft) deep. Indonesia’s disaster agency spokesman posted video of debris on Twitter.Another official said he could not confirm the cause of the crash, with the plane’s black box, comprising the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, yet to be recovered. But it was confirmed that the pilot had requested to turn back shortly after takeoff.“We will collect all data from the control tower,” said Soerjanto Tjahjono, the official. “The plane is so modern, it transmits data from the plane and that we will review too. But the most important is the black box.”On Monday afternoon the national search and rescue agency said it had determined the location of the black box, but had yet to retrieve it.The Lion Air plane that crashed into the sea moments after takeoff on Monday had been used by the airline for only two months. It has been described as the “world’s most reliable airplane”.The 737 MAX 8 model was first operated for a commercial flight in May 2017 by Malindo Air, but has since been adopted by airlines globally. The plane is a variant of the Boeing 737 Max series, which is the fastest selling plane in Boeing history. Worth upwards of £70m, the Max 8 version has an air range of 6,570km and\u0026nbsp a passenger capacity of up to 210. The planes are built at Boeing’s factory in Renton, Washington, in the US.The plane has been purchased by airlines across the world, including American Airlines, United Airlines, Ryanair, Jet Airlines, FlyDubai, Norwegian Air, Iceland Air, SilkAir, Turkish Airlines, Korean Air, Air Canada and Malaysia Airlines.The crash in Indonesia was the first incident involving the 737 Max model. In a statement released after the Indonesia crash, Boeing said the company “stands ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation.The incident is the first to be reported that involves the widely sold Boeing 737 Max 8, an updated, more fuel-efficient version of the common 737. The first Boeing 737 Max jets were introduced into service in 2017. Boeing released a statement saying it was closely monitoring the situation.The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, expressed his condolences in a televised address.Australian government officials have been instructed not to fly Lion Air until the cause of the crash can be determined.Indonesia is one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, although its safety record is patchy. The crash could potentially be the country’s second-worst air disaster since 1997, industry experts said.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b83c441387eb4e32b8f54f487c1d7e2d012538b3/191_30_1870_1122/master/1870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e7a4e0236ae6932c515677071bb3478","title":"the remains of stalin gulag railroad soviet union a photo essay","story":"In Russia’s Arctic wilderness, the remnants of one of the Soviet Union’s most notorious gulag projects lie largely forgottenFrom 1947 until 1953, tens of thousands of prisoners, many of them “politicals” convicted for “anti-Soviet acts”, were shipped to northern Russia to lay a railroad through some of the harshest terrain on Earth.The railroad would have connected Russia’s Arctic waters with its western railway network.Most records relating to the gulags, the brutal network of forced-labour camps for dissenters, criminals, and other perceived threats, remain secret. But it is likely that Stalin, spooked by the incursion of Nazi submarines into the Arctic during the second world war, wanted the railway in place as a means of supplying a planned naval port. The railway also would have connected northern nickel mines to Soviet factories in the west.But just days after Stalin’s death in 1953, the project was cancelled amid the subsequent Soviet “thaw”. Since then, the railway’s gulag camps have lain abandoned, sinking further into the forest under the weight of each winter’s snow. Getting to the camps today is difficult outside of winter, with most lying beyond terrain that would bog a tank.Only specialised vehicles, like this balloon-tyred Trekol in which Chapple travelled, are able to move through the swampy region where the railroad was laid.But the biggest threat to survival, according to another former prisoner, came from the brutal winters, which frequently dropped below -40C (-40F).Prisoners were kept ided in gendered barracks. One survivor, Alexandr Snovsky, says the men would throw letters into the female zone to communicate in secret.Some remains, such as this shack that probably housed guards, have been maintained and are regularly used by hunters.Most engineers engaged on the railway were free workers, while the heavy labour was carried out by prisoners. Most of the railway, as evidenced by this old signal marker, has fallen into ruin.For Snovsky, who now lives with his wife near St Petersburg, the biggest tragedy was the project’s futility: “Tens of thousands of human lives for nothing. For me, the saddest thing was that it was for nothing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Keith Russel took part in memory of his daughter who competed with him in 2017Machine used for stroke victims has broken down during treatmentBishop blames media\u0026rsquos consistent negative coverage for shortfall in fundraisingGroup were pictured outside an Islamic centre in Newtownards, say reportsGuitarist one of several name suggestions for \u0026euro5 million footbridge in city centreThe new 50p piece is expected to be announced in the UK budget on MondayOfficials tell Law Reform Commission that prison should be norm for serious offencesFianna F\u0026aacuteil rebuffs Casey plan to join and lead partyPatient advocacy group concerned that drug is being supplied without required written informationCampaign accuses presidential candidate of \u0026lsquocomplete misrepresentation\u0026rsquo of their viewsStructural issues found at five facilities with six cleared to fully reopenBody fulfils functions and duties when the office is vacant or the president is abroadStrong exit poll measuring party voting intentions gives Taoiseach pause for thought\u0026lsquoIreland is rightly proud of our reputation as a modern, liberal society,\u0026rsquo says FlanaganGarda\u0026iacute search for driver of car which was abandoned after incident in ArdeePresidential order is made of goatskin parchmentPeter Casey \u0026lsquostood up for something\u0026rsquo and won support because of that \u0026ndash councillorIncumbent breaks record despite lowest turnout of any presidential ballot ever"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3679654.1540826279!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lord mayor s marathon medal presented to adoring dad","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKeith Russell (left) with race director Jim Aughney prior to the  marathon on Sunday. Photograph: Ramsey CardySportsfileNavan Co Meath man Keith Russel was awarded the Lord Mayor’s Medal in the 2018 Dublin City Marathon. Mr Russel was running in memory of his seven-year-old daughter Alanna who was born with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy, depriving her of speech and use of her arms and legs. Despite her condition, Alanna took on a new lease of life when her father brought her out training for the 2017 marathon, his first Dublin City Marathon and one which he ran while pushing Alanna in a specially built chair.In preparation for last year’s Dublin Marathon, they managed to raise nearly €65,000 to buy a new minibus for the Meadows Respite Centre in Navan, which Alanna attended. In December, Alanna passed away unexpectedly and Keith, despite this tragedy displayed incredible courage and determination to run the Dublin Marathon, once again, this year in memory of his daughter. In honour of his commitment, the Lord Mayor of Dublin Nial Ring presented Mr Russel with Lord Mayor’s Medal 2018. Mr Ring and the organisers of the SSE Airtricity Dublin Marathon said he was “honoured” to announce Mr Russell, as the winner and noted that Alanna Russell was the youngest-ever competitor in the Dublin Marathon, when her father pushed her along the course in a wheelchair in 2017.“Each and every runner that partakes in the SSE Airtricity Dublin Marathon has an inspirational story behind their journey to the 26.2mile finish line. The Lord Mayor’s Medal is about celebrating one runner who has had a particularly challenging journey to compete in the 2018 Dublin Marathon. Keith Russell is a worthy recipient of this year’s Lord Mayor’s Medal. He is a truly inspiring character who has dealt with the terrible tragedy of the passing of his daughter, and has since pushed himself mentally and physically to compete at this year’s Marathon in memory of Alannah”, the Lord Mayor, said. The Lord Mayor’s medal was inspired by the efforts of all who partake in the marathon each year and is presented to one runner who has either exceeded incredible odds to partake or has an inspiring story, fuelling their marathon journey.The specially commissioned medal was first presented to 2009 finisher Martin Codyre, who was involved in an accident that left him paralysed and in need of 24-hour care. His brother and friend pushed him around the course to help him complete his marathon goal."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177653497_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc legal correspondent wrong say nda signed freely","story":"BBC legal correspondent criticised for saying NDA was signed freely Court of AppealThe BBC has been told it is “inaccurate” to claim that women who entered into non-disclosure agreements after they had made allegations about sexual harassment did so “freely”.Media and employment lawyers have said it is likely there would be an “imbalance of power” during negotiations to settle a claim and therefore it was incorrect to view these contractual relationships as free of “abuse”.Yesterday, a BBC journalist claimed the judgment by the Court of Appeal “made clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure”.

She said on Monday she hoped to continue to help the emperor and empress as a former member of the Imperial family.The Imperial family’s loss of Princess Ayako – who receives a one-off payment of around £744,000 (107 million yen) from the state  – brings the total number of family members to 18, including 13 women.The figures reflect the growing succession crisis facing Japan’s shrinking royal family, with only four male heirs to the throne currently remaining, including Crown Prince Naruhito, who will take over when his father abdicates next year.While there have been growing calls for reform of the Imperial succession law in recent years, changes have been resisted by powerful conservatives who are strongly opposed to women inheriting the Chrysanthemum throne. Princess Ayako, who works as a research fellow in Social Work Studies at Josai International University in Chiba Prefecture, was introduced to Mr Moriya by her mother last December.Mr Moriya, whose hobbies include marathons and triathlons, attended schools in Paris, Switzerland and the UK before graduating from prestigious Keio University in Tokyo.The bride instantly connected with Mr Moriya, whose late mother was reportedly a long-time close friend of the bride’s mother, when they first met, telling media this summer: “I remember that our conversation got so lively that it didn’t feel like we had just met and that I had so much fun that I forgot about time.”Meanwhile, Princess Mako, the oldest grandchild of the Emperor, had also planned to marry her fiancé Kei Komura this year, before the nuptials were postponed for two years due to insufficient preparations.Please review our commenting policySkeletons must not be sold as Hallowe\u0026#39en props, doctors warnedDetective had junior colleagues \u0026#39under his spell\u0026#39 as he abused his rank to gratify him sexually, hearing toldComment: Angela Merkel will not get to pass the crown to her preferred successor without a fightComment: Angela Merkel\u0026#39s legacy is a polarised Germany now verging on the ungovernableUniversity students asking for mental health help up 50 per cent in five years, FOI shows, as minister says they must be \u0026#39supported not mollycoddled\u0026#39Angela Merkel says she will step down as Chancellor in 2021 after bruising regional electionsWho let the dogs out?

Their conflict has been simmering ever since, but flared up again in January this year.Ja Rule couldn’t help but lash out, and since then things have been more tense than ever, with their back-and-forths on social media serving as a by-product of a dispute that began in the streets.Most recently, 50 Cent decided to try and troll Ja Rule by purchasing 200 tickets to his forthcoming show in Las Vegas, for a total of around $3,000 – and leave\u0026nbspthe seats empty. Ja Rule seemed to find the prank just as amusing as Fiddy did (he still got paid, right?), and responded by posting an image of his rival with makeup photoshopped on (real mature, Ja).Here’s a timeline of their beef so farIn 1999, Ja Rule was robbed for his chain at gunpoint in Southside Jamaica, Queens while he was filming a music video. According to 50 Cent, Ja Rule was incensed after seeing\u0026nbspFiddy\u0026nbspat a club with the man who robbed him.\u0026nbsp“A friend of mine robbed Ja Rule,” 50 Cent\u0026nbsprecounted in his 2005 biography From Pieces to Weight. “That’s how the beef originally started. My man robbed him for a chain, and then this guy named Brown came and got the chain back for Ja. Later, Ja saw me in a club with the kid who robbed him. I went over to say, ‘What’s up’ to Ja, and he acted like he had a problem with me. But I’m not the one who robbed him.”But Ja, who later confirmed the robbery took place, denied he ever saw Fiddy with the robber. He claims that the bad blood between them stemmed from Fiddy being snubbed by the Murder Inc. crew during a video shoot for his single “Murda 4 Life”.That same year, in October, 50 Cent released a single from his shelved debut album Power of the Dollar, which was a blatant diss directed at Ja and Murder Inc. It didn’t name Ja Rule directly, but it did mock\u0026nbsphis label’s signature “Murda” chant which gave fans enough of an idea about who the track was directed towards.50 and Ja Rule got into a physical altercation at an Atlanta nightclub, where they were both booked to perform. Both their neck chains were broken during the fight – a member of Fif’s crew found Ja’s pendant, and 50 claimed that a deal was made to return it in exchange for a Movado watch – Ja denied that was the case.Machine Gun Kelly responds to Eminem\u0027s \u0027Killshot\u0027 diss trackNothing But Thieves perform an acoustic session for Music Box series 4In a 2016 interview, Chris Gotti offered his own take, which was that the two were talking one-on-one when Ja hit 40 Cent with several questions at once. Fiddy lashed out, then Ja Rule allegedly pulled his shirt over his head and began swinging punches. Whichever side you believe, the incident proved to be a massive catalyst for the events that followed.In March 2000, after receiving word that 50 was recording at the Hit Factory studios in New York, Ja and his crew decided to pay the rapper a visit. In the altercation that followed, Fiddy suffered a stab wound, and Ja Rule and Murder Inc. rapper Black Child were both arrested. Black Child took credit for the stabbing on record, claming it was an act of self-defence. In interviews after the attack, 50 consistently downplayed the incident.After signing a multi-million dollar deal with ShadyAftermath records in 2002, 50 Cent and G-Unit released the mixtape No Mercy, No Fear. One of the tracks, “Wanksta”, was credited by Fiddy as being inspired by Ja Rule. It became his first hit single, peaking at No.13 on the Billboard Hot 100.After the brawl at the Hit Factory, Irv Gotti claimed Fiddy signed an order of protection against him and Ja, in an attempt to put his street credibility on the line. It was later confirmed that the order does exist, but was issued on 50’s behalf – not his request – as a formality by the NYPD. In June 2018, Ja Rule shared the order again on social media and called 50 Cent\u0026nbspa rat.\u0026nbsp50 Cent wasn’t happy at being called a snitch. He fired back on the G-Unit mixtape The Future is Now via several tracks that dissed Murder Inc. “I Smell Pussy” was particularly brutal – 50 called out Irv Gotti, Ja, Black Child and Cadillac Tah by name.50 Cent finally released his debut album, the universally acclaimed Get Rich or Die Tryin’, on 6 February 2003. It claimed the top spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart and featured the track “Back Down”, which questioned the authenticity and street cred of Ja Rule and Murder Inc.In April 2013, Ja Rule came back with one of the most disrespectful diss tracks in hip hop history. “Loose Change” fired shots at 50 Cent, G-Unit, Eminem, Eminem’s daughter Hailie, Dr Dre, Busta Rhymes and Chris Lighty. Ja accused 50 of being a snitch, called Dr Dre a “faggot”, claimed all of the men mentioned enjoyed golden showers, called Eminem a cross-dresser and his wife a “slut”.Fans thought “Loose Change” was memorable, but 50 Cent, Eminem and Busta Rhymes were still able to come back with “Hail Mary”, which mocked Ja’s obsession with Tupac Shakur.Ja Rule’s fifth studio album was released in November 2003, and marked a noticeable change in style from his previously more melodic work. It was critically panned and failed to match up to the success of his multi-platinum albums: Rule 3:35, Pain is Love, and The Last Temptation.During an interview with Hot 97 in September 2013, Ja Rule admitted he felt as though he and Murder Inc. had lost the war with 50 Cent.For the first time in years, the two rappers came face to face when they ended up on the same flight… on the same aisle. Ja Rule posted about the experience on Twitter but revealed, to the surprise of fans, there had been no issues between the two.50 Cent headlined the Hot 97 Summer Jam festival in 2014, and used his stage to mock Murder Inc (again) when he performed “I Smell Pussy” during his set. Ja Rule heard about the show and, rather than firing back, claimed Fiddy was obsessed with him.Ja Rule’s memoir was released in July 2014, and chronicled his rise to fame and all the tumultuous moments that followed. During one chapter, he claimed that it was 50s info that led to a federal investigation into Murder Inc – an accusation that 50 Cent has denied.Despite Ja claiming the feud had “flatlined” by this point, 50 Cent couldn’t help mocking his rival by sharing a photo of Donald Trump appointing him as “secretary of festivals”. This was after Ja was blasted for his role in the Fyre Festival fiasco of April 2017.Drake and Meek Mill spent summer 2015 in a battle of words, which some fans compared to the beef between 50 Cent and Ja Rule.\u0026nbspHowever, neither Fiddy\u0026nbspor Ja\u0026nbspwas impressed, and appeared to agree that the younger artists had nothing on their feud.The latest of many, many chapters in this ongoing and now quite exhausting saga is when 50 claimed to have purchased 200 tickets to Ja’s forthcoming show in Las Vegas, with the intention that there would be a bunch of empty seats at the gig.In the posts on Instagram, he shared a Photoshopped image of himself sitting among the empty seats, along with an edited video that showed Ja Rule performing to an empty venue. Ja Rule seemed more amused by the stunt than anything, tweeting in response: “I get under @50cent skin… I love it!” Later he posted a photo of 50 Cent, which was Photoshopped to look as though the rapper was wearing makeup and a wig.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Under Irish corporate law you need the support of three times that.\u0026nbspBut it should be forthcoming. Some 30 per cent of Ryanair’s investors voted against Bonderman’s re-election the last time around.\u0026nbspThey had good reasons for opposing another year of the septuagenerian American. He’s been in post for more than 20 years. That would raise questions about his ability to serve as a check on the power of the CEO, and an independent voice on behalf of shareholders, at any company, let alone one run by a man like O’Leary.\u0026nbspWhen you serve for that long it’s not just furniture you have in your title. You become part of it.\u0026nbspBut this isn’t really about Bonderman. It’s about O’Leary, a man for whom pugilism is as natural as breathing is to the rest of us.\u0026nbspThe LAPFF, and other progressive voices among Ryanair’s investors, have raised issues about the aggressive way he runs the the company in the past.\u0026nbspBut he, and Bonderman, and the rest of the company’s directors, have been able to ignore them because of Ryanair’s previously stellar financial and share price performance.\u0026nbspThere aren’t many shareholders that will square up to a winner, even when the seeds of\u0026nbsptrouble are easy enough to see.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Three quarters of the bank’s profits so far this year have come from its Asian operations, leaving the European business trailing in its wake.“Profit growth has been broad-based across HSBC’s main banking activities, and what’s positive is that’s coming from a rising top line rather than simply cost-cutting, which can only deliver results for so long. Indeed adjusted operating costs have actually ticked up, though that’s to support investment in growth opportunities, notably in the bank’s digital proposition.”He added: “As an international retail and commercial bank, HSBC is clearly plugged into the global economy, and in particular the fortunes of China and the surrounding area. While in the long term this looks like an ace in the sleeve, investors should expect a bumpy journey, particularly if Trump’s trade war dents growth in the region.”Shares in HSBC rose 4 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The lender reported pre-tax profit of $5.9bn (£4.6bn), up from $4.6bn in the same period of last year, and higher than analysts’ expectations of $5.6bn. Revenue also rose, by 6 per cent, to $13.8bn, although the bank said foreign currency translation movements knocked $300m off revenue growth. Meanwhile, expenses were reduced by 2 per cent between the second and third quarter and revenue –\u0026nbspspending fell to $7.7bn from $7.9bn.John Flint, who was appointed as HSBC’s chief executive last year, taking up the role this\u0026nbspFebruary, said: “These are encouraging results that demonstrate the revenue potential of HSBC. We are doing what we said we would – delivering growth from areas of strength, and investing in the business while keeping a strong grip on costs. HSBC publishes fairy tale for childrenHSBC profits rise after strong showing in Asia despite trade war fearsHSBC profits fall as bank’s spending outgrows revenue in first quarterHSBC to largely stop funding fossil fuel industries“We remain committed to growing profits, generating value for shareholders and improving the service we offer our customers around the world.” Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, said: “The key to satisfy the shareholders is to spend less and deliver higher growth numbers and, in today’s earnings report, HSBC has nailed this. The bank’s biggest challenge was to tame its cost. “In its earnings report, the numbers across the board were encouraging.”Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “HSBC may be the second biggest company on the UK stock market, but its profits are predominantly emanating from its historic home in the far east. Three quarters of the bank’s profits so far this year have come from its Asian operations, leaving the European business trailing in its wake.“Profit growth has been broad-based across HSBC’s main banking activities, and what’s positive is that’s coming from a rising top line rather than simply cost-cutting, which can only deliver results for so long. Indeed adjusted operating costs have actually ticked up, though that’s to support investment in growth opportunities, notably in the bank’s digital proposition.”He added: “As an international retail and commercial bank, HSBC is clearly plugged into the global economy, and in particular the fortunes of China and the surrounding area. While in the long term this looks like an ace in the sleeve, investors should expect a bumpy journey, particularly if Trump’s trade war dents growth in the region.”Shares in HSBC rose 4 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).The BBC has not yet announced when Cox, who is currently the presenter for Radio 2\u0027s 10pm-midnight show Monday to Thursday, will begin her new role on Drivetime.\u0026nbspBefore joining the BBC in 1999, she worked on Channel 4\u0027s\u0026nbspThe Big Breakfast,\u0026nbspMTV and various other shows. She first appeared on Radio 2 in 2011, and has stepped in to host the Radio 2 breakfast show when Chris Evans has been away in recent years.\u0026nbspIn 2013, she got her own show on Radio 2 by launching Sounds of the 80s, which she hosted until earlier this year.\u0026nbspMayo recently denied that his decision to quit had anything to do with Whiley joining the show, following a report in The Sun that claimed he was leaving after being “forced” to work with her.\u0026nbspThe DJ, who has hosted Drivetime since 2010, said he “loved” working with Whiley and added she had been his “first and only” choice when the show was reconfigured.Chris Evans records lowest listening figures in six yearsSeann Walsh becomes latest celebrity to leave Strictly Come DancingSimon Mayo quits Radio 2 show and denies rift with co-host Jo Whiley“Juggling my writing and radio has become increasingly tricky (a nice problem to have),” Mayo said. “I\u0027ve just signed a new 2 book deal with the nice folk at Transworld and they\u0027ll be expecting something half decent before too long.\u0026nbsp“I know, I know, I\u0027m as surprised at this turn of events as you. But at my grand old age to be setting off on these brand new trails is enormous fun. And all the more so for being so unexpected. There are, however, only so many hours in a day.”Addressing reports of a rift between himself and Whiley, he added: “One other thing. maybe it needs to be said, maybe not but there is no room for argument so I\u0027ll be clear. I\u0027ve loved working with the exceptional Jo Whiley and when the show was \u0027reconfigured\u0027 she was my first and only choice.“Some of the abuse she has had here has been appalling. Support for a show is one thing, assaulting the dignity of a warm-hearted and loyal friend is another. So by all means discuss what\u0027s happening here, but let\u0027s keep some civility. Here endeth the lesson.”Whiley is also leaving the Drivetime show, moving to a 7pm-9pm, Monday to Thursday slot to present a new music show.Responding to Mayo\u0027s departure, she said: “I\u0027m incredibly sad that Simon has decided to leave Radio 2. He\u0027s a brilliant broadcaster, a great friend and I really will miss working with him.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

CEO Jack Dorsey said he did not like it and it would disappear soon, the report claims.Twitter \u0027deeply sorry\u0027 for failing to act on threat from Cesar SayocNow Twitter has said the button is being reconsidered and that it is possible that it could disappear in the future.As we\u0027ve been saying for a while, we are rethinking everything about the service to ensure we are incentivizing healthy conversation, that includes the like button, it wrote in a tweet that quoted the \u0027s report. We are in the early stages of the work and have no plans to share right now.Brandon Borrmann, who works in communications at Twitter, said specifically that claims it would happen anytime soon were wrong – but that it could be happening in the future.We\u0027ve been open that we\u0027re considering it, he tweeted. Jack even mentioned it in front of the US Congress. There\u0027s no timeline. It\u0027s not happening \u0027soon\u0027.Twitter has been explicit that it is thinking about the way its site works, in an attempt to address concerns about the healthiness of discussion on the platform.That discussion\u0026nbsphas sometimes focused on the role of the like and retweet buttons, which exist as a way for people to approve of posts. People including Kanye West have suggested that those numbers should be hidden entirely – a move that Mr Dorsey\u0026nbspdid not seem to reject.But it has been repeatedly criticised for failing to address some of its more central problems, including from users who believe it should be acting to ban people from the platform rather than\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was in complete bad taste and was not funny nor entertaining.\u0026nbsp“The police have confirmed that they are treating this as a hate crime and rightly so. Nobody within our community should live in fear or intimidation from a group of people who through this action have offered nothing but that.\u0026nbsp“The Muslim community are contributing much to society in Northern Ireland. Everyone has the right to live here.

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators with banners \u0027We\u0027re with EU\u0027 during the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, Britain, 20 October 2018.

In those circumstances, I suggested the EU should begin preparatory work on the extension of Article 50.“Because what would not be a good thing in my view is if we managed to get a referendum but it was too late because we had left the EU or the EU had not made preparations for an Article 50 extension.”Mr Khan added: “Whatever Theresa May brings back will probably be rejected by cabinet, almost certainly rejected by the party, and if not will definitely be rejected by parliament.“That’s why I said to Michel Barnier: listen, you need to start preparing for the possibility of extending Article 50 because if that is the case we will need time to have a referendum.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is only right that they have a say in their nation’s future.”Mr Hutton added: “This careful analysis shows just how badly young people – already disadvantaged by the breakdown of career structures and high housing costs – will be further hit by Brexit.”And Mr\u0026nbspOluwole said: “Now that the implications for our generation have become clear, we need a People’s Vote on the government’s Brexit deal.”The research comes as the Brexit talks remain deadlocked over the issue of the Irish border backstop – with just five months until departure day next March.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He jokes that his parents turned to him and said, \u0027Philip, one day that could be you\u0027.\u0026nbspHe goes into some terrible banter about how having the Budget on Wednesday would have drawn headlines such as\u0026nbsp\u0027Hammo\u0027s Halloween horror\u0027.Hammond says the tough decisions of the past few years \u0027were not driven by ideology\u0027 to huge jeers from Labour, who say austerity is\u0026nbspa political choice.\u0026nbspHe says that the \u0027era of austerity is finally coming to an end\u0027.Philip Hammond is on his feet to huge cheers. He says this is a Budget for \u0027hard-working families\u0027 who care little for the ins and outs of Westminster politics.\u0026nbsp\u0027The strivers, the grafters and the carers who are the backbone of this economy\u0027 are the focus of his Budget, he says.\u0026nbspHe hints at Theresa May\u0027s promise to end austerity, saying it is time for the public to know their hard work has paid off.Cheers for the PM and the Chancellor as they arrive in the Commons chamber.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has insisted that flights between the UK and EU will not be grounded after Brexit despite admitting that talks on route access have not begun.He told a gathering of UK airport bosses that the process is not in our hands.The single market for aviation, created in the 1990s, means there are no commercial restrictions for airlines flying within the EU.The continuation of flights between the UK and the EU after Brexit will require either a fresh deal with the European Commission or bilateral agreements with inidual countries.Speaking at the annual conference of the Airport Operators Association, Mr Grayling said: I have had plenty of talks with both the Commission and other transport ministers.We will start formal talks as soon as they are willing to start formal talks. As I sit here today, they haven\u0027t been.But I haven\u0027t met one single person either in the Commission or a member state who believes there will be an interruption to aviation.Mr Grayling noted that Ryanair boss Michael O\u0027Leary, who has repeatedly claimed flights could be grounded, is selling tickets for next summer and expanding the number of routes between the UK and the European Union.He went on: There is no way that flights will stop between the UK and the EU after March.Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has said resolving problems in the roll-out of universal credit should take priority in the budget over infrastructure projects.It followed a call by a widow to Nick Ferrari on LBC who claims working tax credit but expects to lose about £300 a month under the new system because some of her income comes from her late husband\u0027s occupational pension.Mr Rees-Mogg said: Universal credit is a good system in that it helps people into work and means that work always pays, and that is the most successful route out of poverty, but to have a system that takes £300 a month out of people\u0027s pockets, particularly widow\u0027s pockets, shows that there is a failure in the implementation.I can only apologise and say that as somebody who voted for the Universal Credit, I\u0027m very concerned that it\u0027s working in this way and what you highlight, and what listeners will be hearing today, will make many people think that some reform needs to be made to ensure this doesn\u0027t happen, and to recognise that if there is money available to be spent in this budget, sorting out problems like the one you refer to would be my priority, even over and above adding to the roadbuilding projects.Ahead of the Budget this afternoon, Downing Street has insisted all the spending commitments to be announced are “funded irrespective of a Brexit deal”.The comments follow the chancellor’s warning that he will have to review spending if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal – and hold an emergency Budget next year.There has been tension between No 10 and Philip Hammond about whether the prime minister’s pledge to end austerity depends on getting a Brexit deal – with a more-cautious Treasury hinting it does.Theresa May’s spokesman denied there was a disagreement, saying: “All of the spending commitments that the chancellor will set out today are funded, irrespective of a deal.”However, the key point is that the prime minister has not promised that austerity will end with today’s Budget, pointing instead to a “long-term approach” in next summer’s spending review.Labour is certain to leap on the fact that cuts pencilled in for the next financial year – to councils and benefit claimants, amongst others – will continue until at least 2020, without action today.No 10 did agree with Mr Hammond that another Budget is possible next year if there is a no-deal Brexit, suggesting it would be the chancellor’s call.“If the economic circumstances change, then we would consider economic interventions,” the spokesman added.The EU said there were no plans to mint a special euro coin to mark Brexit after reports that a commemorative 50p would be released in the UK.A European Commission spokeswoman said: We have no current plans to do anything of the sort.On ITVs Good Morning Britain, Justine Greening, the former Tory education secretary, suggested she could run in the party\u0027s next leadership contest.\u0026nbspShe told the programme: We need a guarantee on opportunity for people in this country in the same way that we try to give them guarantees on health and guarantees on dignity if they are falling out of work.In response to the suggestion that sounded like a leadership manifesto, she said: Things need to change, don\u0027t they, and I think people need to have some hope for the future, that Britain can be a country that runs differently and more fairly than it does at the moment.Asked if she would run if there was a vacancy, the Putney MP said: I might be prepared to, but I\u0027m more interested in the Conservative Party actually showing what it can do for this country.Yes, we spent a lot of time having to fix the nation\u0027s finances but what we now need to do is discover - maybe rediscover - our own mission, which has got to be about how we make sure that young people growing up everywhere in this county have the same access to opportunity and it shouldn\u0027t matter whether they have got parents who are maybe middle class, a bit more sharp-elbowed.Talent is spread evenly. The challenge of Britain is that opportunity isn\u0027t. That\u0027s what we have got to fix.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The leader told a news conference in Berlin it was “time for a new chapter”\u0026nbspin German politics.Brexit transition period could be too short, Merkel warnsMs\u0026nbspMerkel said she took responsibility for the CDU’s recent losses in local elections and told party members that she would not run again for the leadership of her party at a conference in December.This would leave her in the position of staying as chancellor while not being the leader of her own party. The German constitution has strict rules regulating\u0026nbspthe process of appointing the\u0026nbspchancellor, with parties nominating a named candidate for the position\u0026nbspahead of elections.The move would not be unprecedented: Helmut Schmidt, West Germany’s chancellor from 1974 to 1982, never led the SPD of which he is a member.“Firstly, at the next CDU party congress in December in Hamburg, I will not put myself forward again as candidate for the CDU chair,” she told reporters.Merkel allies face losses as voters flee to far-right AfD, poll saysMerkel’s top ally in Brussels launches campaign for EU presidency“Secondly, this fourth term is my last as German chancellor. At the federal election in 2021, I will not stand again as chancellor candidate, nor as a candidate for the Bundestag, and ... I won’t seek any further political offices.”She added that she would not run for chancellor if a snap election were held before 2021, and that she had made the decision not to stay on as party chair before the summer parliamentary recess.\u0026nbspThe chancellor said that two issues,\u0026nbspBrexit, and US-Russia relations, would be the main focus for her as long as she remained in office.Whoever becomes the new leader of the CDU to succeed Ms Merkel\u0026nbspwould be the front-runner to be the country’s new chancellor after the next elections. A vote is slated for December at the party’s regular congress.Three people are so far being widely named as possible successors.\u0026nbspAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a moderate\u0026nbspwho is politically close to Ms Merkel, currently serves as the CDU’s general secretary and was formerly the regional governor of Saarland.\u0026nbspThe dpa press agency says Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer, known informally in German political circles as as AKK, told a private meeting of senior party members she would stand for leader at the CDU congress in December.Health minister\u0026nbspJens Spahn​, who has been publicly critical of Ms Merkel’s liberal refugee policy,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspRalph Brinkhaus,\u0026nbspwho leads the party’s group in the Bundestag having ousted one of the chancellor’s\u0026nbspallies from the post in a narrow vote last month, have also been linked with the position.\u0026nbsp​The outgoing leader confirmed that she would not formally back any of the candidates, however.Ms Merkel has been leader of her party since 2000 and was elected as chancellor in 2005. If she makes it to the end of her term in 2021 as planned she will be the second longest-serving chancellor in the history of the German federal republic, surpassed by only Helmut Kohl.Created with Sketch.

The waning of her party’s standing in the polls has sapped her once fearsome authority.The summer was also characterised by a policy\u0026nbsprow about refugees\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspCSU, the CDU’s Bavarian sister party with which\u0026nbspit has been in alliance since 1949.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I cried for hours over her body – she was just  - but how could I refuse  I brushed her hair as I would my daughters.”Despite these sad moments, Debbie says her job is her passion, and she always makes light conversation with her customers as she works on them.Make-up for funerals is usually only needed for an open casket or when relatives have requested to see the body at a funeral home.By this stage, the embalming process - a treatment in which the body is preserved via injection with a chemical solution - has been completed, so the body’s eyes are shut and their mouth has been stitched closed.“I will always talk to the bodies, she says. I tell them what I’m doing as I go along, andthey have very evident injuries, like broken bones or tell-tale signs of illness like discoloured skin, I just say: I’m so sorry you had to go through this.“I have used embalming packs on faces, where the death has been particularly violent, or an illness has altered their facial features in drastic ways. It’s just like a face pack I leave on overnight and plumps up their skin.”Debbie’s job also involves dressing the bodies with items of clothing family have brought in.“About a month ago, I had two ladies, one of  and one of , both whom had young children, she says.They had both died of cancer and I put a special wig on one of them, and the other had requested she was buried in her wedding dress.As her job can often be very upsetting, Debbie says a pinch of dark humour is sometimes needed, too.“Sometimes I’ll get myself into a real pickle. The family will send in clothes that are far too small or large and I’ll have to cut bits and bobs here and there. Sometimes outfits, like mini-skirts, are just not appropriate for a dead body,” she says.“Once a family also requested that their loved-one wore fake eyelashes. In le she had used the same pair about  times so I stood there for ages just trying to glue them on.”She adds: “There are also the times where bodies move at the funeral home. It’s not quite like it sounds, but they do groan as they release gas so it’s just a little movement.”John Harris grew up around dead bodies and has worked as a funeral home director for as far back as he can remember.His great-grandfather founded T. Cribb in , and the company has now established a reputation for their effective embalming. This is the process of flushing a body with preservative chemicals, including formaldehyde, which stops the body from decomposing.The mouth is then sewn shut and eyelids are secured with caps – thick lense-like layers that stop your eyes from appearing shrunken.John says certain formulas for embalming fluid are as coveted as the Coca Cola recipe, with some embalmed bodies lasting for over two years without decaying.“We’ve made a name for ourselves because we can keep bodies for a long time in, for want of a better term, good condition, John says. Older formulas often made the body look very waxy and made them very stf. Bodies now are very natural to touch.John explains: “The fluid itself tends to be marked with a rose tinted colour, leaving the effect of a natural skin-tone in the deceased.“Very often, when somebody has died from a long-term illness or through an accident and families have watched their relatives go through and deteriorate – the embalming process makes them look much more like they did before.“The easiest way to describe embalming is like a blood transfusion. The fastest parts to discolour on the body are where blood flowed.“When somebody dies, the blood reaches the lowest point. Sosomebody’s face is laying to one side, that side of the face will be purple.“So the idea is to use the arteries system of the body and flush everything out. It can take anything from an hour to several days, depending on the condition of the body.”Johns company preserves corpses from all over the world, including Ghana, where he has one of his many funeral parlours. Here, bodies are often kept for months, and it isn’t unusual for relatives to ask for the body to be placed in the deceased’s favourite chair at home, so the family can pay their last respects.“We once had a lady who sold roasted sweetcorn on the side of the road, John says. After she died, we prepared her body to sit in the exact position next to her sweetcorn-roaster, so locals could see her just as they remember.However, the old joke about funeral workers always being in business isnt going to hold true forever.Now funerals can be so direct, John says. You can send someone a body and a cheque and they’ll send you back a pot of ashes.“I once spoke to a man whose mother died and he told me: Don’t do the funeral on a Monday, Wednesday or Friday, because I play tennis. That epitomises how le is now and the attitude to funerals – whatever is the most convenient.”Planning to go to university to study performing arts, le changed for Ellie Carr when she was offered a position at a funeral directors aged , and she has never looked back.Now a funeral director at A.W.Lymn in Nottingham, Ellie says: “My mum is a palliative care nurse so death has never been a taboo in our family.“I would find watching people suffer very distressing, but I love what I do. There is more control in helping people after death, and being there for their families.”Ellie says the stereotype of funeral directors as the Morticia Addams-type, with long-black hair and an obsession with all things death couldn’t be further from the truth.“It’s actually much more about helping people, there is a very old-fashioned view on the job sometimes,” she says.“There’s a lot more personalisation around funerals now. There are balloon releases, colourful clothing, and funeral favours are becoming popular.“They can be chocolate, or something like memory seeds – it’s a really nice touch.”“Making the experience so personal is something I take great pride in. I just treat people how I would like to be treated.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He will be ever so happy.When it comes out he will enjoy it. Guaranteed hell watch it, he wouldnt be able to not too. Hell have his little crew in the TV room, wont he “It prolongs the pain of the families - it will never leave them, but he’ll just keep picking the scab off the deep cut, and pouring a little bit of salt in it all the time.”Today, Joe is confident and bubbly, chatting over a cup of tea in a unicorn mug. But shell never be able to forget the campaign of abuse she endured at the hands of cruel Bellfield, who used to brag about raping other women while he was with her.I have a few questions I’d like to ask him, she says. What actual pleasure did he get out of it all ”Joe adds: “I told the police in an interview I did that I’d get back with him tomorrow - because he’d have the best meal, the best day, the best sex, and I’d slit the c***’s throat as he slept and put an end to all of it, because it’s all of us lot paying for him to live his le of luxury.”And she still stands by this sentiment, adding: The victims haven’t got that, so why should he be allowed to be a fat f**k in prison Joe initially met Bellfield in  when she was  and regularly went to a bar in Twickenham, called Rockys, where he worked as a doorman. But it wasn’t until some years later, in , that they began dating - and another decade would pass before Bellfields true depravity was revealed to the world. Bellfields first victim would turn out to be Milly Dowler, who went missing from Walton-Upon-Thames on her way home from school in .Her body was found six months later, dumped in a wood in Yateley Heath, in a horric case that went unsolved for nine years, with Bellfield eventually convicted in .Then in  Marsha McDonnell was hit over the head with a blunt instrument after she got off the bus near her home in Hampton, London, and in August  French student Amelie Delagrange was found battered to death in the street in Twickenham.Joe, who is now a horse groomer, can still remember in vivid detail the start of her horrying relationship with the hulking killer.  says: “He was huge. He was a big bloke. I didnt fancy him at first, but he was a proper ladies’ man - everyone knew that.“Then my dad died, and I was in a vulnerable place. He kept on askingI wanted to go for a drink and a meal, and in the end I did.“He stayed that night, and never left.”At the start of their relationship, there weren’t any signs Bellfield was evil. She says: “He’d turn up with flowers and was a gentleman. When he wasn’t psychotic, you couldn’t want for a better boyfriend.”However, almost immediately after Joe fell pregnant with their daughter Bellfield turned aggressive.Joe says: He started with the odd slap. He came home annoyed one night - there was no reason, it was out of the blue.“I was shocked, but my hormones were all over the place and I was still upset about my dad.“I believed him when he said it was because he loved me and he was jealous.“He was convinced Id been having affairs even though I hadnt even left the house - and he couldn’t help it and he was really sorry.”From there the abuse got worse, and by the time Joe fell pregnant with her son in , daily le had become hell.Joe says: “One time he came home from work and I answered him back and he went mental – punching, biting, kicking, pinching.“Towards the end of the relationship he’d use weapons. He hit me with a rubber mallet, he’d burn me with cigarettes - he’d bruise and cut me but it was always from the neck down.And the torment didnt end there, with rapist Bellfield frequently forcing himself on her at any hour of the day.It didnt matter where we were -he wanted it, he took it, she says. You didn’t argue. You could fight but you’d always lose. It could be weekly, daily - over that period it was over  times.“He’d call me fat, stupid, say how useless I was as a mum, that I had no friends. You start to believe it.” Le became a vicious cycle of control. She says: “He was brilliant when my daughter was born. Hed always have time for the kids, and they were always well-dressed. This is why I don’t understand how he can take other people’s children away from them, because as a father he was very good.“Even after he beat the s**t out of you he’d still buy you things – sovereign rings, Kickers shoes, take you on holiday, clothes, stuff for the horses. Sometimes he’d say he was sorry but he would then start to say it was your fault. It was like he had multiple personalities.“They make you believe you’re a piece of s**t on the floor.“When people say why didn’t you walk away the first time  Until you’re in this situation and you’re living that le, you can’t know what it’s like.“I was just target practice. He was just warming up.”Bellfield – who has converted to Islam now and goes by the name Yusuf Rahim while in HMP Frankland – regularly bragged about raping girls when he ed from work as a doorman, according to Joe. But without evidence, she was too scared to say anything.Joe says: “I knew about a lot of the rapes. He’d come home bragging about it, but when I was in that position with two kids, what could I do  I’ve got to live with the guilt every day knowing potentially I could have stopped him, but there was never enough people to come forward.Imagine knowing what he is, and what he’s like - he gets arrested, gets questioned and gets let out - who’s going to get it  I fought for my le everyday - I was terried for my own le.“He bragged about raping a disabled girl on the bonnet of the car in the car park of a club. There were doormen who were there that knew, and nothing was ever done about it.Joe eventually split from Bellfield after he beat her up while heavily pregnant with their son, who was born in . She sought an injunction but Bellfield ignored it.Despite moving on with another girlfriend, Bellfield continued to terrorise Joe for years – while going on to commit multiple murders over a three year period. And it was Joe who finally exacted revenge on her evil ex by helping to bring him to justice.Joe got in touch with police after spotting Bellfield’s car on a Crimewatch programme about the attempted murder of schoolgirl Kate Sheedy in .The -year-old had been hit by a white people carrier Joe recognised as Levi’s, reversed over, and left for dead.With the help of Joe’s statements, Bellfield was convicted in  and given a full le sentence for the murder of Marsha and Amelie, and the attempted murder of Kate. He was later given the same sentence in , when he was found guilty of murdering -year-old Milly Dowler.Recalling the time that she saw his car on Crimewatch, Joe says: I was still in touch with Levi, but no longer felt scared of him. Hed moved on, he wasnt living with me anymore and I had more freedom so it was totally dferent. I called the police anonymously and told them that white people carrier had been on my driveway a couple of weeks before and it was my baby father’s car. However nothing was done at that point.“I can tell you nearly all his cars – the reg, the colour – because he stalked my le daily for  years, and would be in dferent cars all the time. You were always aware of him being around. Later that year Joe went to the police again, after the murder of Amelie.“I went into the incident room on Twickenham Green and told them Levi was a wheel clamper, had a white van and hated blondes.”Joe came face-to-face with Bellfield once again while giving evidence at Milly Dowler’s court without a screen. She says: “The last time I saw him was at the Old Bailey, and he stared back at me, he was so p***ed off.“I had photos showing hed been to Yateley horse show - the same area Millys body was found.”Today, Joe is eager to put her old le as far behind her as much as she can. She has created a new le and has been in a new relationship for nine months.“My son initially wanted to go and see Levi in prison when he was about ten, she says. I wasn’t happy about it but thankfully he changed his mind. It’s not my place to stop them seeing himthey want to.”She spends most of her time travelling for work or looking after her kids, her elderly mum and five horses, but she’s still scared by the psychological torment she suffered.She says: “I still don’t trust any guy. The minute they tell you they’ll never hurt you or cheat on you, they’re gone.“I’ve had one serious relationship since I’ve split up with him. Some friends laugh and call me ‘man hater’, but why should you trust when you’ve been through that “There’ll be god knows how many things he’s done that the police don’t know about and they’ll never know about.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I’m happy to tell Sun on Sunday readers that their hard work is paying off.Our jobs market has defied many of the naysayers.Near record numbers of people have a job and unemployment has fallen in every region across the country.There are more than .million additional people in work since .While this is a huge achievement, sometimes it’s easy to forget that behind these numbers are thousands of people up and down our country who are now better able to provide for their families.They can get up every morning knowing they have the security that only a job can bring.And what’s more, they are being rewarded with a pay rise — this month’s figures show the strongest wage growth in almost a decade.Contrary to myths peddled by the opposition, it’s people at the bottom of the pay scale who have benefited most.The lowest earners working full-time have seen the fastest rise in pay thanks to our National Living Wage and the proportion of low-paid jobs is at a record low.Tomorrow I will deliver my Budget, where I will show how our careful focus on fixing the economy is bearing fruit.Thanks to the balanced approach we have taken — getting our debt falling, while keeping taxes low — and the hard work of the people of the UK, I will be able to set out how we will be investing in our future.Much of the talk surrounding Budgets is often technical. Many, many experts and commentators will have their own take on how the economy is doing.While this is, of course, important, what most ordinary people really care about is how the Budget will improve their day-to-day lives.And one of the issues which I know Sun on Sunday readers care a lot about is transport. With a thousand more people moving into work every day, it’s important that we help to get them there on time.Many of you preparing to start the working week tomorrow will know the frustration of having your journey to work ruined by delays caused by poorly maintained roads. Or of having your car or van damaged by potholes.This isn’t just a bad way to start the day, it’s bad for businesses large and small, and it can be really damaging to the wider economy as well.It’s estimated that congestion costs UK households more than £billion every year. That’s why tomorrow I will announce a bumper £billion investment in our country’s transport network — including a new £.billion fund ring-fencing vehicle excise duty raised in England for spending on our roads.As a former Transport Secretary, I know that these are the arteries that keep our country alive – and they need taking care of. Thirty-two years ago tomorrow, Margaret Thatcher officially opened the final stretch of the M.While few would claim to love this motorway, it’s easy to forget what a landmark moment this was for our country’s transport infrastructure. Three decades later, I am committed to honouring that legacy.And as important as our major roads are, smaller local roads are just as vital to our everyday lives.That’s why I will also announce tomorrow £million of immediate cash for councils to maintain and improve local roads — fixing potholes, repairing damaged roads and keeping bridges safe and open.A further £million on top of that will help improve local junctions, allowing better access to workplaces, high streets and other community facilities.This is also part of our commitment to bridging the gap between our regions. Those in rural parts of the country should have the same chances to get on in le and not have poor transport connections limiting their potential.The funding will help make journeys quicker and easier, while boosting productivity and improving access.And because I know that not everyone drives, I will also invest in local transport projects which could include new bus, tram and cycling routes.And I will also look to the future by investing in next-generation methods of transport, which could potentially include self-driving shuttle services.Not only could this revolutionise our transport network, it will also help us become a global leader developing future technologies.And finally, as I earlier announced with the Prime Minister, I am happy to confirm we will also be freezing fuel duty, for the ninth year in a row.This will keep the cost of fuel down for millions of drivers across the UK — saving people around £million this year alone.These measures are only possible due to our careful management of the economy over the past few years — and the hard work of the British people.This country has a bright future ahead, and — thanks to this vital investment package — the journey there just got a bit smoother.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows the strength and resilience of the UK economy alongside the efforts and hard work of families and households up and down the country.In conventional times voters might rightly expect the result of this to be lower taxes , more investment in our public services or to see progress in us paying off the ever ballooning national debt.Instead the Government is preparing to blow this cash - your money - by giving into even more of the EU’s demands.Until last week, Britain expected a  month “transition” or “implementation” period after we formally leave the EU next year on March , .Then, late last week the Government shocked everyone by proposing that we stay in the EU longer than we were originally told and that we extend the so called ‘negotiating period’ to leave the EU.Worse still, on Monday in the House of Commons, we were told that this transition period might last until June  – that’s six years after the referendum result. Whatever happened to Brexit means Brexit On top of our extended membership of the EU, we can expect a bill from the EU! That’s right more of your money with an extra price tag of approximately £ billion each year in contributions to the EU.The Treasury has budgeted for this until the end of  but for each year after , the cost will be as high as £ billion because we will have lost the £. billion a year rebate which was famously secured and successfully negotiated in  by Margaret Thatcher when she demanded our money back from the EU.The British people are once again being treated like fools. What we are now witnessing is a blatant attempt to keep Britain in the EU while Brussels continues to raid the pockets of British taxpayers.This must end and the Government should invoke the great Thatcherite spirit of Fontainebleau and say No, No, No to Brussels. Because pumping our money into an undemocratic and unaccountable system two years after Britain voted to leave the EU is simply not right or acceptable. It makes a mockery of our democracy and is an insult to the British public.It is our money and that money should be handed back to the people and communities across the UK to invest in our domestic priorities.It could help people across Britain– especially the least well off – by giving them back more of the money that they earn by cutting their taxes.For example,we cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny, that would cost us £ billion.By increasing the personal allowance by a £,, many more of the poorest paid households would be taken out of tax altogether, that’d cost us £. billion. Andwe cut beer and cider duty by  pence, that would cost us £. billion.So by easing the tax burden for the lowest paid and doing our bit to save British pubs from closing, we’d have invested £ billion into longer term economic growth in our economy.And with the other £ billion  How about supporting the millions of families who want to own their own home by cutting stamp duty for homeowners, we can again help the least well off and give them a hand up and support them in their aspirations to own their home.We could also take more first time buyers out of paying stamp duty altogether  If we raised the starting threshold of £, to £,, this would cost the Treasury £. billion.Then there’s the VAT we pay on domestic gas and electricity.

a condition that causes tissue, such as part of the intestine, to protrude through a weak spot in the abdominal wall.The hernia can cause a bulge and pain around the pubic bone.The teen was due to have surgery to repair the hernia, but it was postponed due to school commitments.Testicular torsion occurs when a testicle rotates, twisting the spermatic cord that brings blood to the scrotum.The reduced blood flow causes sudden and often severe pain and swelling.Testicular torsion is most common between ages  and , but it can occur at any age, even before birth.Testicular torsion usually requires emergency surgery.If treated quickly, the testicle can usually be saved.But when blood flow has been cut off for too long, a testicle might become so badly damaged that it has to be removed.Symptoms:Cause:It is not clear why it occurs.Most males who get testicular torsion have an inherited trait that allows the testicle to rotate freely inside the scrotum.Testicular torsion often occurs several hours after vigorous activity, a minor injury to the testicles or sleep.Cold temperature or rapid growth of the testicle during puberty also might play a role.Complications:When it is not treated it can cause damage or death to the testicle due to blocked blood flow.In some cases it can cause infertility.As the testicle is the organ responsible for producing sperm, any damage to them can impact a mans ability to have children.Source: Mayo ClinicBut during his wait for surgery the hernia began to cut off blood supply to his balls and his right testicle twisted  degrees - thats three quarters of the way around.Testicular torsion is common in teens aged between  and , andits not caught early can result in the testicle needing to be amputated.Doctors at Dayton Childrens Hospital in Ohio, US, noticed a visible bulge in his groin and his testicle was exquisitely painful to touch, according to the British Medical Journal case report.Medics were able to untwist the boys testicle with their hands after making an incision on the right-hand side of his scrotum.His hernia required surgery.The teenager recovered well and was discharged the following day.Our patient presented with worsening groin pain and a pre-existing diagnosis of an omentum-containing right inguinal hernia [a hernia that folds into the peritoneum], Dr Arturo Aranda wrote in the case report.The most obvious assessment was that this hernia had become incarcerated [trapped in the abdominal wall].Yet on physical examination, his high-riding testicle and exquisite tenderness prompted a more thorough investigation with ultrasound that confirmed decreased blood flow to the testicle.Early diagnosis can potentially be the dference between saving the testicle or its loss.Ultrasound should be performed early so that manual reduction can be attempted prior to surgical intervention.In our case, this provided immediate relief for the patient, and an intra-operative discovery of a  degree torsion, which is in a range correlative with testicular salvage.Had we successfully reduced our patients’ inguinal hernia in the emergency department, a  sense of security could have easily delayed our operative intervention until morning.Because of clinical suspicion and a testicular ultrasound, we knew that delay was not an option. This further supports the recommendation that all patients with inguinal and testicular pain should undergo ultrasound before any decision to delay surgery is made."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000445324299.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"angela merkel step down german chancellor 2021","story":"The veteran politician has faced calls from within her own Christian Democratic Partyto give up after they were given a drubbing in regional elections.Her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, stepped down as leader of his party in  but remained chancellor.Merkel has led the CDU since  and has been Germanys leader since .In the past she has firmly stated that Chancellor should also be a party leader but todays events appear to indicate a change of heart.The CDU haemorrhaged votes, losing more than  per cent of its support, with the Greens and far-right Alternative for Germanymaking big gains.Merkels decision to let in more than a million migrants in  deeply ided the country and helped spark an election backlash.German politics expert Nina Schick told The Sun: “This fast tracks her exit.

We’ve never seen anything like this.The PM has claimed that austerity is coming to an end in a hint that tax cuts and spending boosts could be on the way.But the Chancellor - nicknamed Spreadsheet Phil - is keen to drive down the deficit by keeping the purse-strings tight.Brits were watching out for expected income tax cuts, with the tax-free personal allowance likely to be raised.Business rates were also set to be cut for small firms, while the VAT threshold is likely to be frozen in another boost to entrepreneurs.And hard-pressed motorists will welcome a freeze to fuel duty, which follows a long-running Sun campaign.But there was expected to be bad news for pension savers with the amount they can store up tax-free set to be cut.On the spending front, the biggest expense was

Promises are always so nice, so welcome, so... fantastic. But the best way to handle a smiling assurance - whether its being made by a partner, a plumber or a politician - is to judge them all on what they do, not what they say.Only then do you go back to the promises, and seethey stack up. To be fair, Chancellor Philip Hammond has a hell of a job selling optimism to a nation riven by Brexit, gross inequality, and High Street turmoil. Its even harder when the best he can leak is pothole repair fund, paid for with higher road taxes. And things change. The world is always in flux, which means even the most decent of politicians may find it impossible to deliver on a pledge they once genuinely thought possible.But thats no excuse for all the things Hammond should be telling you, but isnt. What people dont say is far more important than what they do, and hes left some very important things out of his budget:. An apology  When the worlds banks crashed in , governments all over the globe stepped in to save them. Not because they like banks - but because in those places where they didnt, mortgages were foreclosed, loans were called in, wages werent paid, suicides increased, and recession sucked at society.The Tories would have done the same,they were in power. They werent, so they blamed Labour for debt that was actually duty, and once in government used it to justy swingeing austerity that cut police funding by a fth, given the NHS a year-round winter crisis and thrown a million extra children into Victorian levels of poverty.Economists warned in  that spending cuts would choke the breath out of a struggling economy - that you must invest in people and businesses to save and make money in the long term. The Tories ignored the logic, and by cutting services increased costs for all of us. Since Hammond became Chancellor two years ago he has been urged repeatedly to turn on the taps, and refused because of that failed, flawed, demonstrably  Tory ideology. Not one damned thing is cheaper or better as a result of austerity. A decent Chancellor would admit it was wrong. . Sanity  The government has spent pound.billion on HS before it even begins, the price keeps being revised upwards and it wont be finished until  at the earliest. The total projected cost is now estimated at pound.bn, which works out to poundm per platinum-plated mile.It has also spent pound.bn over  years on Universal Credit, in which time it has been rolled out to fewer than % of benefit claimants, costs have risen to pound just to process each claim, the DWP has been found guilty of disability discrimination and its been linked to hunger, illness and suicide. Over the same period, the government has been repeatedly warned that its a cock-up, too expensive, and wont save money. Today, Hammond is announcing hes ploughing even more money into something so disastrous it should be renamed Logically Shredded. In gambling, this is known as the sunk cost fallacy - the idea that, because youve thrown so much cash at this already, you cannot stop. Rather than count the price of their lunacy the Tories are claiming thatthey just throw a few more billion at it, theyre bound to win. They are literally playing roulette with your money, while saying theyve got this, its fine, dont want to let the other guy have your money because theyll waste it. They should be in therapy, not government.. A proper concept of time  Every promise in Hammonds speech will be for things that wont happen for years. Years in which other budget promises will overwrite these ones, previous years money will be rationalised downwards, and accounting practices will be shted slightly to make it look like next year will be better than last. Its a bit like promising your family a trip to Boston, and never telling them when it will be, that they will have to pay for it, or that its the Boston in Lincolnshire and not the one in Massachusetts.Itll sound like hes promising you mental health nurses tomorrow - but once hes cut money from something  to pay for it, and recruited  people to work in rotation for -hour shts at every hospital and school in the country, plus holiday cover, well all be dead. . Recycling It has been a little over  months since China refused to take any more of our foreign garbage and in that time the British plastic mountains have been photographed from space.Bales of unrecycled waste are piled up at abandoned airfields and rubbish dumps while councils - which have no money because of that austerity every sane person knew was a bad idea - say it is now too expensive to do anything with.Now increasing amounts of plastic are being incinerated, with parabens hurled into the atmosphere, or buried where they can degrade into tiny toxic balls that get into rivers, soil, animals, food and, oh yes, every human gut.How we deal with waste is dferent for every local authority, but the rules on landfill sites, packaging and recycling targets are all written in Westminster. The nation needs a national recycling strategy, where the same things are collected, in the same bins, in every area and every supermarket and shop has the same rules about minimising packaging and plastic. Its not dficult, stupid or expensive. It just takes someone with the guts to suggest a fresh idea, rather than the same empty promises they made last time. . Reality  Hammonds promises all depend on  things: A Guesstimates B Bad eyesight C Brexit not being badUnfortunately, guesstimates butter no parsnips, theres always at least one financial journalist in spectacles going through the small print, and Brexit is considered to be A Bad Thing by car manufacturers, fishermen, farmers, the financial services industry, academics, and anyone who wants to go on holiday somewhere other than Skegness. Even Nigel Farage has admitted it could be doomed, which means this budget is too.A Budget is nothing more than nail nish. A way to pretty the overall animal, and make you look at the tips rather than the body. Ultimately the best test is to seethe paints been chipped off by some serious journalism by this time next week, enabling you to notice the ragged, snaggly ends of the Tory superiority complex.Ask yourself this -the Chancellor was a plumber or your partner, would you believe him  Or would you be distracted enough by his joke about a p coin to keep him in his job "},{"url":null,"title":"angela merkel not seek re","story":"NewsAngela Merkel is to stand down as German chancellor in  - and the Euro has tumbledThe CDU leader told party leaders she will not stand to be chairwoman of the Christian Democrats - but is said to want to remain ChancellorShareCommentsByJoseph NasrAndreas RinkeAnn Gripper:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsAngela Merkels CDU have suffered poor local election results \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAngela Merkel has said this will be her final term as German chancellor confirming that she will not run in . She confirmed today her fourth term as chancellor would be her last, heralding the end of a -year era in which she has dominated European politics. Merkel, , has been chairwoman of her conservative Christian Democratssince  and chancellor since . She is also giving up the CDU role in December, starting a race within the party to succeed her. Standing down from the party chair would allow a new CDU chairman or woman to build a profile before the next national election, due in . The Euro fell after the news emerged. Merkel had today faced calls from her own party to stand down as leader after poor local election results. Merkels Christian Democratswon Sundays election in the western state of Hesse but support fell by more than  points. The CDU is reliant on an alliance with the centre-left Social Democrats, the SPD, who are coming under pressure of their own. Their support is falling as they suffer in coalition.  SPD leader Andrea Nahles, whose party saw support fall to its lowest since , has threatened to end the alliance with Merkels conservativesthere is no improvement on policy. Merkels weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in the European Union at a time when the bloc is dealing with Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist parties making gains at European parliament elections next May. Merkel, chancellor for  years, will have to invest her political capital and tactical acumen to keep together her loveless coalition, borne out of necessity seven months ago after an inconclusive federal election last year. The CDUs Christian von Steffen said bluntly: We need a meaningful programme with a clear path and new faces. Merkels favoured successor is said to be CDU party secretary general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.  CDU leaders will meet next Sunday to prepare for a summit in December where party members will vote for a new chairman. Nahles is also feeling the heat from SPD members still disgruntled with their leaders decision to join Merkel instead of fulfilling an election promise to sit in oppositionthey fail to win the federal vote. Nahles said on Sunday she would propose a roadmap to allow the SPD to measure the progress of the ruling coalition, which has been plagued by infighting, at a mid-term review next year. Her proposal did little to appease the head of the SPDs youth wing, who said the election in Hesse was a clear signal that the ruling coalition was not viable. The final verdict on the coalition has been spoken, Kevin Kuehnert wrote in Twitter. Voters dont want business as usual. Merkels coalition was twice on the brink of collapse, once over immigration policy and then over a dispute about the fate of the domestic intelligence chief who was accused of harbouring far-right views.  The instability has further eroded the credibility of the conservatives and the SPD in the eyes of German voters, who are increasingly turning to smaller parties on the right and on the left. In Hesse, where Merkels CDU rule with the ecologist Greens, the two biggest winners were the Greens and the far-right Alternative for Germany .

Over a million people turned to high cost credit last year to meet basic living expenses, which is counterproductive both for households and the economy. If finances are tight and your fridge breaks down, the last thing you need is expensive credit - what you need is simply a replacement fridge. By taking away the additional high cost of borrowing, the new scheme will demonstrate how no interest loans can act as a realistic and better alternative to short term high cost credit. It can only be a good thing to reduce the risk of households building up problem debt as a result of trying to meet their basic needs. On breathing space, he adds: The fact that breathing space is being introduced is a great step forward, but it#xs vital that the government listens carefully to responses on how the scheme design should be finalised . There are three crucial elements still at stake. First, all debts and enforcement activity #x including debts owed to government #x need to be included in the breathing space. Second, there needs to be flexibility to extend the -day time periodnecessary, to avoid the risk of people who are in the process of sorting out their debts being put back to square onetime runs out before this process is complete.

Over a million people turned to high cost credit last year to meet basic living expenses, which is counterproductive both for households and the economy. If finances are tight and your fridge breaks down, the last thing you need is expensive credit - what you need is simply a replacement fridge. By taking away the additional high cost of borrowing, the new scheme will demonstrate how no interest loans can act as a realistic and better alternative to short term high cost credit. It can only be a good thing to reduce the risk of households building up problem debt as a result of trying to meet their basic needs.On breathing space, he adds:The fact that breathing space is being introduced is a great step forward, but it#xs vital that the government listens carefully to responses on how the scheme design should be finalised . There are three crucial elements still at stake. First, all debts and enforcement activity #x including debts owed to government #x need to be included in the breathing space. Second, there needs to be flexibility to extend the -day time periodnecessary, to avoid the risk of people who are in the process of sorting out their debts being put back to square onetime runs out before this process is complete. And third, the administration of the scheme needs to be proportionate, using the existing expertise of partner debt advice charities, to avoid becoming bogged down in expensive bureaucracy.:Mikey SmithHammonds fiscal firepowerAsked whether Mrs May agreed with the Chancellor that an emergency Budget might be needed in the springthere is no deal, the PM#xs spokesman said: What the Chancellor said yesterday was that he would use the fiscal reserves that we have built up through hard work and sound economic management to ensure that Britain will succeed whatever the circumstances.The Chancellor has spoken on numerous occasions about having maintained what he would describe as #xfiscal firepower#x which he will be able to use in the event of a no-deal scenario.He added:What the Chancellor was pointing out in relation to a budget was thateconomic circumstances change, he would consider economic interventions.

He suffered a bleed on the brain, but fortunately survived.Police are now investigating the circumstances surrounding the assault last year, which left a terried Euan soaked in blood.The young man, from Dundee, Scotland, recalled: As I got out of the taxi I just heard footsteps behind me and heard a loud bang.  Then I felt this immense pain in my head and I was knocked clean out. I was laid into when I was on the floor.I was left laying there in a pool of blood. He left me for dead. I woke up with blood in my eyes and my clothes were soaked. I stumbled into the kitchen and it looked like a murder scene. I had never seen so much blood. My whole body was in agony.I was so scared. He added: I needed  stitches on my face and I had a few broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder and a bleed on the brain. It has totally changed my le forever. Euan, who stands ft ins tall, claims the attack happened following what he thought was a harmless discussion about religion.  Medics reportedly carried out tests which showed he was struck with a thick metal pole, like a crowbar, during the attack. He says he was forced to shell out pound, for his medical treatment and now suffers with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder . I keep reliving what happened in my head, he said. I will never be the same again. Euan who was working on a farm at the time, had flagged down the yellow cab after a night out with a friend in Melbourne in June . He claims the driver became visibly annoyed when he said he was an atheist and when he expressed his views about religion. The architecture student recalled: He didnt like it at all when I started expressing my views... I tried to change the conversation but he kept going on about it. I could see he was getting wound up.  It was after Euan had got out of the car in Aberfeldie, in the early hours of June  that year, that the attack allegedly occurred.He claims that he was expecting the cabbie to drive off when he was suddenly smashed over the head and beaten to a pulp. When he woke up, he recalls having pain all over his body and believes the driver battered him as he laid unresponsive on the pavement. He stumbled into his home before collapsing on the kitchen floor. Euan claims he suffered bruised ribs, a battered shoulder and multiple cuts to his face, as well as the bleed on the brain, in the attack. He called an Uber to Melbournes Sunshine Hospital following the incident, where he stayed for around a week.He says he was forced to borrow money from friends to pay for a pound, medical bill. And he was treated on a specialist mental health ward after he started experiencing suicidal thoughts.  He travelled home to his family a few weeks after the attack. More than a year on, Euan has only just felt able to speak out. He has been reimbursed for his medical bills and awarded pound, in injury compensation by the Australian government. However, cops have yet to trace the taxi driver - and Euan says he is petried to step foot in a taxi, with his confidence shattered.The young man, who lives with his girlfriend, Sharon Macrae, , says he has been left mentally scarred and suffers with PTSD. He said: It has left me in a terrible place and has totally changed my le. I used to be a really confident person but since the attack I have terrible nightmares. It has seriously affected my mental health. Whenever I think about it I get upset. It was just absolutely shocking.  I just cant believe that someone would do that to me. Im a big guy, ft in tall and  stone, and I never thought anyone would be capable of that. Ill be stuck with PTSD for le. I wake up screaming and shouting in the night quite a lot. A Melbourne Police spokesperson said: Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding an assault in Aberfeldie on  June, . It is believed a man was standing outside his home address on Fawkner Street in the early hours of the morning when he was struck in the back of the head by an unknown offender. The victim, -years-old at the time, sustained serious head injuries. The victim reported having a verbal altercation with a taxi driver prior to the incident.

Others believe the doorman had acted in self-defence after she tried to hit him first. The incident was filmed outside the Oddfellows Arms in Chester, Cheshire, on Saturday night -although it is not immediately clear who employed the doorman. At the start of the clip both the man and the woman are on the ground, suggesting the fight had already started. The man stands up, his legs not too stable, and lts his arms in the air, appearing to goad the bouncer into a fight.  The bouncer and the man take positions in front of the pub, both facing each other. The man holds his arms out before suddenly taking a swing at the bouncer. The bouncer blocks this, attempts to grab the man and kick him, but misses. Beside them, the woman who was still kneeling on the ground, finally gets up. The man continues to provoke the bouncer, which merits him only a kick to to the legs, knocking him to the ground. The woman then approaches the bouncer and tries to hit him but is blocked and shoved hard to the ground. Off camera people can be heard protesting at the bouncers actions on the woman, with someone saying: “Oi, don’t touch her.” The bouncer then turns round, now appearing to pursue the people protesting, before the clip ends. The video was uploaded to Facebook by Kirk Johnstone, , whose brother filmed the incident when going for a Chinese.Kirk uploaded the clip with the caption: “My little bro went for a nice Chinese in Chester and this was going on outside.” The clip has been viewed , times since it was uploaded and most Facebook users were disgusted at the bouncer’s reaction against the woman. Sharon Cull said: “Thats terrible behaviour of the doorman. I didnt think they were allowed to touch people.” Kelly Littler wrote: “Shameful. I bet he dont have a wehe hits a woman. Bully.” Sharon Powell commented: “Big hard man hitting a woman.” Cathy Ward said: What a horrid doorman. He should be sacked for that, he looked so proud that he knocked a woman to the ground. I hope the police get this video or the chronicle news paper. However there were some who defended the doorman’s actions. Tanya Haddock said: “Both deserved. If she’s coming towards him and wants to try attack him like a man then get treated like one. He can’t smack her in the face, so yes push her away.” Ben Sykes wrote: Am I the only person here that sees the doorman being in the right  Two punches were thrown, both were at the doorman.

Lee and Kerry Whitehead, along with their five children - three of which still live at home - are perhaps the keenest of Santa’s little helpers in Kingswood, Hull. Incredibly the family set up their extensive decorations on October  as part of their three-month Christmas tradition that gets bigger and more extravagant every year. Speaking to Hull Live about how the tradition began, Mr Whitehead said: “I’ve been doing it since I bought my first property  years ago and previously with my parents. “It’s all about the kids. We’ve got three young ones and two older ones who don’t live here now and they love it. “It’s all about Christmas for me and the kids. Every year we add to it. We go to VIP opening nights at garden centres and get discounts just to add to it.

I know I’m crazy for it.” Lee, who owns a successful legal firm, says he spends thousands of pounds on Christmas every year and has already outlaid hundreds in  to make sure this year’s spectacular show is better than ever. Orders are in for some big additions to his festive collection and he admits there is still much more to come until this year’s look is complete. “I’ve done about  per cent and there is about  per cent left to do. I’ve still got the back garden and the balcony to do,” the father-of-five said. “I want a big projector with Father Christmas coming down the roof.

But the early Christmas present isn’t always popular with the neighbours. He said: “We’ve been in our house  years this year. “For me it’s three months. We get a few stares of people but they don’t mind it. “One of my neighbours loves it.

Mum Zoe Archer knew something wasnt right with Alisha Riley after spotting the unusual behaviour. And she trusted her instincts and took the little girl to the doctors where, after tests and scans, it was confirmed Alisha had a cancerous brain tumour. Zoe, from Huyton, Merseyside, first noticed the symptom in February when her daughter was  months old. The -year-old said Alisha, who has a twin brother Jack, was crawling when she saw the youngster was tilting her head to the left She told the Liverpool Echo: It was only slightly but she did it for a few days and I just thought she may have a bit of a stf neck. She wasnt crying with it and it wasnt stuck in that position. However days later Alisha began to vomit and the mum took her to AE.  She underwent a number of tests at both Alder Hey and Whiston Hospital which came back clear. But when she continued to deteriorate Alisha was given a scan - which is when doctors dealt the devastating blow that the youngster had a brain tumour. Zoe said: I knew she wasnt right. It was like she had gone back to being a two-month-old. I had to prop up cushions around her. It was like she was dizzy. Her eyes would roll and she wasnt able to keep down anything - she would just throw up. When they said it was a tumour it felt like my heart had stopped. I just looked at Alisha and started crying. Alisha was rushed to Alder Hey where doctors told her family she had a cm by cm tumour - the size of a golf ball. The tumour was located in her posterior fossa - an area in the brain responsible for critical s such as breathing, balance, speaking and co-ordination. Doctors firstly drained the fluid in Alishas brain and days later she had to undergo a nine hour surgery to remove the tumour. Zoe said: It just all wasnt really registering with me. Doctors were telling me of the risks of surgery and that my tiny baby could die. I was trying to listen, but it just wasnt going in. Although the surgery was a success, Alisha was not recovering as fast as doctors would have hoped and another scan showed the devastating reason why.  Alisha had a cancerous grade three brain tumour called an Ependymoma - which would grow back. Zoe said: We couldnt believe it. We had been happy because the surgery had been a success and had thought - the tumour had been removed so the cancer had been removed. The family were given a number of options including radiotherapy and chemotherapy - but due to her age both treatments came with their risks. Another option was a specialist treatment called proton beam therapy in Florida. And in June the family made the decision to fly to America for  weeks - in a bid to save their daughters le. A Go Fund me page, launched by Zoes brother Lee, raised more than pound, for the family - for their costs while out there. And after  rounds of treatment this week the family were given the fantastic news that Alishas scan was clear of cancer. Zoe said: I am so proud of how she has handled everything. She just kept smiling. Doctors have said she is about a year behind with her development, but she is getting there. She is learning to crawl again and Jack and her are playing together again. He has been great with her and will get down on the floor and crawl with her to get her going. Alisha has also been helped to move around by Newle - a charity for disabled children. Newle runs the only emergency loan service for children providing urgently needed, specialist equipment within hours, and provided a specialist buggy for Alisha. Zoe added: Because of her condition Alisha can’t sit up or support her own head, so she needs a specialist buggy with extra head support and chest straps to keep her in a stable position. Without that to keep her safe we couldn’t go. Now Alisha and her twin, Jack, are getting ready to celebrate their second birthday at the end of October. Le’s definitely not been easy and Alisha will have to have another scan in January, but we are over the moon. I think every time a scan is coming up we are going to be anxious. But now I will know the symptoms to look out for.

According to researchers, parents who waited  to  months after their first child reduced the risk short and long term risks to both mum and baby. Whereas parents who had a little time between pregnancies were at risk of maternal mortality or severe morbidity. The researchers found a short gap between pregnancies affected mothers aged over , while risks to the infant were found for all women - particularly for those aged  to .  Laura Schummers, a post-doctoral fellow at the UBC, said: Our study found increased risks to both mother and infant when pregnancies are closely spaced, including for women older than . The findings for older women are particularly important, as older women tend to more closely space their pregnancies and often do so intentionally. The study is the described by the authors as the most extensive evaluation of how the role of pregnancy spacing could be impacted by maternal age. It is also the first investigation of pregnancy spacing and maternal mortality or severe morbidity - rare but le-threatening complications of pregnancy, labour and delivery - in a high-income country, the authors said.  Among women over  who conceived six months after a previous birth, the researchers found a .% risk of maternal mortality or severe morbidity.Waiting  months between pregnancies, however, reduced the risk to .%, the authors said. For younger women, the researchers found an .% risk of spontaneous preterm birth - delivery before  weeks of pregnancy after labour that started on its own - for pregnancies spaced at six months. For younger women who waited  months between pregnancies, however, the risk dropped to .%. Senior author Dr Wendy Norman, UBC associate professor, said: Achieving that optimal one-year interval should be doable for many women, and is clearly worthwhile to reduce complication risks.

He had also told the woman he had a “lovely dream” about her wearing white knickers. A court heard how he bought the woman a pair and gave them to her after calling her into his primary school office and telling her: They will look lovely on you.

The head at -pupil Glan-yr-Afon Primary school in Llanrumney, Cardf, denied two counts of sexual assault on the woman. Thomas was cleared of one attack but found guilty of the other.  In a victim statement read out at today’s sentencing, the woman described the signicant mental impact the attack had had on her. She said: “Kevin Thomas had a major impact on me. “He has always threatened to buy me knickers. I was always thinking: ‘Please don’t, please dont. “He said they will look lovely on you.

One question read: “If I was a computer, how would you turn me on ” He sexually assaulted her when he rocked his pelvis and clicked his fingers” and pulled the woman towards him.

The revelations feature in a new biography by veteran royal correspondent, Robert Jobson - and come after claims Harrys volatility and hot temper increased in the run-up to the wedding. Harry reportedly raising his voice and telling royal staff: What Meghan wants, she gets! Jobson, who has written the biography now serialised in the Daily Mail, also revealed: The weeks leading up to the wedding had been far more tense for both Harry and Meghan that most people realised. In fact, they’d both felt so stressed that they’d booked a series of appointments with Ross Barr, known as ‘the acupuncturist to the stars’.  Whether these treatments had much impact on Harry is debatable. In the build-up to the wedding, says an inside source, he was ‘petulant and short-tempered’ with members of staff. Other royal revelations include details on Harry and Williams extreme mood swings and unpredictability. The princes are said to show their father Charles, , a shocking level of belligerence, according to author and veteran royal correspondent, Robert Jobson. He claims Harry, , and William, , are not afraid to challenge their father and future monarch when it comes to issues their disagree one. And William has even been known to speak firmly in his fathers face...reminiscent of his mothers hot temper which Charles had to deal with on a regular basis during their marriage.  Jobson also revealed that according to royal family insiders, the boys have quite extreme mood swings, just as Diana did with Charles often wary of Williams reactions and unable to gauge both his sons unpredictability, reports the Mail Online. Shocking details in the book discuss Harrys volatility, claiming he his prone to emotional outbursts and like his mother, tends to wear his heart on his sleeve. Other explosive revelations in the book include claims Charles admitted he knew marrying Diana was a massive mistake before walking down the aisle. The future king, , has revealed he let himself, Diana and the Royal Family down by going ahead with the doomed wedding despite his overwhelming doubts - which at one point reduced him to tears. Charles spent  years married to Diana. He proposed on February , , but Diana felt it was like a call to duty.  They wed at St Pauls Cathedral in London on July ,  and orced on August ,  - a year before the princess died .

Anna Cornelius died in March this year, less than a year after her daughter Hannah Cornelius was killed. Four men are currently standing trial at Western Cape Court and face charges of rape and murder. In a Facebook post titled When Anna joined Hannah, the Hannah Cornelius Foundation confirmed that Anna died on Sunday, March . Her body was seen floating in shallow water by beachgoers in Scarborough, Cape Town. It said: Anna’s friends and family knew her as an amazing human being, full of light, abundant love and energy. Following her daughter, Hannah’s, death Anna founded the Hannah Cornelius Foundation in June .  It said: Anna was driven to ensure that Hannah’s legacy be remembered through her acts of goodwill, forgiveness and love. Through the Hannah Cornelius Foundation, Anna wished to support other young people to reach beyond the realities of their present circumstances and achieve their dreams through hard work, commitment and a passionate dedication to their own development. Anna was a lawyer and leaves behind her husband, magistrate Willem Cornelius, and son, Dries.  The Hannah Cornelius Foundation aims to help underprivileged children access the opportunities “Hannah had in her le” by offering‚ among other things‚ trauma counselling and help with unplanned pregnancies. Hannah Cornelius was carjacked by four men while dropping off fellow student Cheslin Marsh, , at his home in Stellenbosch, east of Cape Town, after a night out in May . Vernon Witbooi, , Geraldo Parsons, , Nashville Julius, , and Eben Van Nieberk, , face a string of charges including murder, kidnap, robbery and rape of the Stellenbosch University student.  One of the alleged attackers claimed Hannah told the gang they could have sex with herthey let her go afterwards. Parsons said he raped Ms Cornelius first, followed by Witbooi and then van Niekerk. He claims he tried to get them to release Hannah but they put her in the boot and drove her to a vineyard.  The court heard Hannah went through an “extremely painful” ordeal before she was killed. Hannah suffered severe vaginal and cervical injuries in the prolonged attack. The court heard how Parsons had plastic pearls embedded in his penis which would likely have made the sex attack more painful.Heavy bruising on her arms show she had been held down and it is believed that probably several of the gang lted the huge rock and dropped it on her head.  At an earlier hearing, it emerged that Hannahs parents were sent a letter from one of her alleged gang-rapists begging for their forgiveness. Eben van Niekerk penned the letter but claims he was told to write in by Sergeant Steven Adams. The letter was reportedly written after his arrest and before the four men first appeared in court. It was translated from Afrikaans and had a number of errors. The top of the letter says: This letter comes from Eben VNK and it was also signed and initialled.  When translated, the letter reads: Herewith I write this letter to Hennas mom and dad. I am sorry for what I did and I askthey can forgive me for what I have done… The girl was like a friend to me but the other accused, I was also scared of them and it wasnt nice to see. I was also scared of them. Dont be angry at me please .

However, there was a reason for this - the arrangement is a sign of protection for women, particularly those who are pregnant, in the initial meeting between iwi, the tribe, and new visitors.  Traditionally the meeting could be a moment of “war” and is an opportunity to air grievances. Barney Thomas, chief elder, explained: “We never ever put our women in that space. “We want to be inclusive but protective, and we would not want to put our women - especially the Duchess because she’s expecting - at risk.” The meeting, of course, went without a hitch, with warm wishes from both hosts and visitors, a welcoming song and, finally, food. The Duke and Duchess had travelled by helicopter to the stunning Abel Tasman national park to enjoy the hospitality of the Maori people.  The couple, who are expecting their first child in the Spring, flew over forests, valleys and clear blue waters before arriving to drizzle.They were welcomed by songs, prayers, countless traditional “hongi” greetings and a banquet of food from their new friends. The ceremony was accompanied by the blowing of a conch shell. Following their arrival, the couple and their entourage made their way along a line of around  hosts, shaking each by the hand. They also performed the gentle nose kiss.  They were then invited to sit in two rows of plastic seats opposite the iwi with their all-female royal household staff in the back row and the Duke, Duchess and their two male translators in the front. Mr Thomas gave a speech of welcome in Maori, followed by a waiata, a song, from the group. “We’ve been watching your tour and we know you don’t get much time off,” Mr Thomas said. “I wouldn’t want to be a royal. So we don’t want to put any demands on you. We want you to enjoy yourself.All we want you to do is relax.”  The Duke, , struck an upbeat tone despite the drizzly weather, which cancelled a tree-planting ceremony. He and Meghan,  stayed inside a dry marquee for tea and cake with schoolchildren. Speaking after being formally welcomed by the Manawhenua ki Mohua people, Harry shared his excitement about visiting with a baby on board. He said: “The weather forecast was a lot worse than this. This rain is a blessing on all of us.From myself and my we and our little bump, we are so grateful to be here. “We bring blessings from my grandmother the Queen and our family. “We are so grateful for your hospitality and the work you do to look after this beautul place.”  The couple also strolled along the golden-sand beachfront on the nations South Island and discussed conservation with a ranger. Harry, wearing a black puffer jacket, and Meghan, dressed in a black Seasalt coat, came across a weka, a small flightless native bird. Ranger Andrew Lamason told the pair that the creature is New Zealands version of a monkey due to its cheeky nature. Teenager Saskia Gray, a youth ambassador, said she was impressed by the Duke and Duchess. They acted very down-to-earth, and they genuinely care about the people and the land, said the -year-old. The couple later boarded their Royal New Zealand Air Force helicopter laden with gts, including a knitted blanket fit for a newborn baby.

The explosive revelations by royal correspondent Robert Jobson claim tensions were high in the run-up to the wedding, with Meghan and Harry even turning to acupuncture as a stress-buster. Now, Jobson has also revealed Harry would raise his voice on occasion, insisting Meghan had everything she asked for on the day of the wedding in May. As part of a serialisation of his book in the Daily Mail, he writes: The weeks leading up to the wedding had been far more tense for both Harry and Meghan than most people realised.  In the build-up to the wedding, says an inside source, he was ‘petulant and short-tempered’ with members of staff. Raising his voice on occasion, Harry would insist: ‘What Meghan wants, she gets. The book also details how Harry and his brother William would have extreme mood swings, with their volatility often mirroring that of their mother Diana. It says how Charles found it dficult to predict their behaviour, and how he was often shocked at the level of belligerence he encountered from his children.  Quoting a royal insider, Jobson writes: To this day, Charles admits he often finds it dficult to gauge either of his sons occasionally unpredictable moods. In that aspect of their nature, both princes are very much like their mother, one close source confirmed. A former courtier made the same analogy. They both have quite extreme mood wings, just as Diana did, he said. She could be your best friend one minute and the next, your worst enemy.

And that knowledge will comfort her forever. “I had no idea,” I said after reading the piece. “Well, it’s not something that comes up in conversation,” she replied.

Paul and Gemma Black, from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, lost little Pearl on on August ,  - when a Range Rover rolled off its driveway, across a road and demolished a wall which crushed her. The parents have spoken out about the pain they will feel for the rest of their lives, and how not a second in the day passes where they dont grieve for their daughter. Now, Paul, who appeared on the TV talent show in , has undergone extensive tattoos all over his body in a bid to numb the pain - and has even come as close to self harm, reports Wales Online. He described how while using a razor to shave his head, he would dig the blade in to see his own blood. Speaking about his loss and heartbreak, Paul said: Ive used tattooing as my therapy, he said. Its literally been therapy for me because when I sit in that chair, for that amount of time, be it five hours, seven hours, everything goes away. I get into a meditative state. When Im getting tattooed its the only time that everything goes away.  For me I shut my eyes and I dont feel the pain anymore. Its become a huge part of my recovery process. Im nearly done now, Im nearly covered. He did, however, confess that he did start cutting himself but quickly stopped. When my head was shaved I did start to cut myself with a razor. I would stand in a mirror and experience the feeling of the razor going into my head so I could see the blood. I realised quickly that I was spoiling the tattoos. Ive never self-harmed until I shaved my head but I would imagine the tattooing is the closest thing that I would imagine someone who self-harms feels. But as I say it does help me through it. Theres no blood. Its nothing to do with the pain. Its that purely meditative state that I get in when Im being tattooed and I can sit for hours. All the other pain goes away. The former singer said he replays the moment Pearl was hit by the wall over and over in his mind every day. As a result he has been diagnosed with severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder . People see me walking down the street and they think I am confident because of this exterior and bravado, but I am absolutely crumbling inside, he said.  I defy any man living to see what Ive seen. No man will see their child getting crushed to death in front of them. No man has seen what Ive seen. He was forced to relive the tragic circumstances leading to his daughters death at the inquest this week and at one point could not bear to say the words out loud. In his heartbreaking evidence he recounted the events leading up to the tragedy and detailed the extraordinary s he went to in a bid to save his two children, Pearl and Ace. He told the court how when the vehicle careered towards him building up speed he threw Ace into the road and tried to step in front of Pearl, but wasn’t quick enough to throw her as well. “The Range Rover proceeded to crush her in front of me, he said. The weight of the wall. She was so small. “I’d rather not go into severe details. There was so much blood. “There was a lot of blood spraying. I could see the death just appearing on her face. “I lted the wall off her. I don’t know how I done it. I was saying: ‘Come back to daddy.’ She was literally limp and leless. “I was screaming: ‘She’s gone, she’s gone, my poor baby girl.’ I was covered in blood.” He told how he was so angry he started to smash up the Range Rover.  “There was a hammer lying on the wall, he said. I smashed every single window. I smashed the back window first. Smashed all the windows, the lights, the bonnet. “I was engulfed with pure anger and rage, as I’m sure you can appreciate. “In my mind, it was the vehicle had killed my little girl. In the  months since that day, Gemma said she still cant bear to visit the scene of where it happened near to her mother-in-laws house. “I havent been to my mother-in-laws house since last August,” said Gemma. “I cant turn left out of the house to go up there.” Paul said the hope that there would be justice for his beautul little girl was one of the things keeping him going. But they said they were devastated when they were told there would be no criminal prosecution against the Range Rovers owner Mr Williams. “We were distraught when the police told us, said Paul.  It was one of the things that was keeping me focused and positive in le - that there would be some sort of justice, some sort of recompense. “Nothing will ever make up for what has happened. No amount of justice would have been right for what has happened to Pearl but it was a huge blow.” The inquest at Pontypridd Coroners Court ruled that Pearls death was an accident.

But the First Lady was totally upstaged in a picture which went viral at the weekend thanks to one girls bored reaction. Melania welcomed  students from Digital Pioneers Academy in Washington to the White House last week as part of her Be Best anti-bullying campaign. Lucky pupils got to go in the White Houses very own cinema room - the Family Theatre - and were treated to popcorn and goodie bags. The group watched the  film Wonder, which tells the story of August Pullman, a boy with facial deformities who goes to a mainstream school for the first time. Melania treated the youngsters to a White House screening as part of National Bullying Prevention Month and after the event, the FLOTUS took to Twitter to share her delight about the students coming to visit.  She tweeted: Thank you to the students and teachers from @DPApcs who joined me and @BetsyDeVosED to watch the movie #Wonder in the @WhiteHouse theatre today. What a wonderful message! #BeBest #BullyingPreventionMonth #ChooseKind. She accompanied the tweet with four lovely images from the afternoon, showing the kids picking up popcorn or sitting in the theatre watching the film. But one photo has caught peoples eyes for another reason. In one of the images, Melania can be seen talking to a group of schoolchildren.  The photo looks candid - asthe photographer has caught them off guard in a natural conversation - some are gesticulating as they chat. And then your eyes find one of the girls, who is staring down the lens of the camera and has her arms crossed asthis were the most boring thing on the planet.

But what is shocking is the s some people will go to, to ensure they shine. Recently one bride-to-be revealed that she secretly fattened up her wedding party ahead of the big day, with fake slimming smoothies. And now another woman preparing to walk down the aisle has come clean about the sneaky way she has seen to it that she will remain the centre of attention at her wedding.  A frustrated fianceacutee took to an Australian Facebook page to vent her feelings about her upcoming nuptials, reports MailOnline. She wrote: Probably unpopular opinion here... but I cant be the only one who wants their bridesmaids to feel pretty... but not TOO PRETTY. My self-esteem cant take it. I just have to KNOW that I will be the prettiest princess. Just this one day. Some people were outraged by her comment, but one woman knew exactly how she felt and admitted she had come up with a plan to make sure all eyes would be on her at her wedding.  And to do this she was forcing her bridesmaids to wear very specic outfits.Her bridal party was banned from wearing dresses to the nuptials, all apart from the Maid of Honour, who was allowed to wear a dress - but nothing that could be considered revealing.The unnamed lady said: My girls are wearing formal pant suits and my MOH is wearing a dress, these girls are going to be COVERED,it wouldnt be too hot Id cover them head to toe. LOL . Unsurprisingly people had some major objections to this.  One person commented: I want my bridesmaids and MOH to wear dresses they like but I do have final say. They can look as pretty as they want, Ill be on top of the world that day. Another posted: This is GROSS. Ive picked out dresses I ADORE for my bridesmaids because they are all beautul and deserve the best. Im also paying for them to have their hair and make-up done because I want them to feel stunning.

The horrying video shows how the animal suddenly broke off from performing before it reportedly mauled the helpless child in Russia. One account claimed the lion sank its teeth into the victims head. The young girl, named as Ksenia, is in intensive care with serious face and chest injuries. She survived the incident but doctors say she will be “scarred for le” and a medic says she has been left with a bite mark on her face spanning from her ear to her chin.  The child had been waving a small flag and the lioness rushed from its trainer despite being on a leash and sprang on the child. One account said the wild animal broke a flimsy safety netting around the circus ring at Uspenskoye village in the Krasnodar region. Valentina Pavlova said she was a member of a medical team which treated the girl at the Central Republican Hospital in Krasnodar. “There is a bite on her face that goes from ear to chin,” she said.  She added that the lioness used its paw and pulled the child inside onto the arena and sank its teeth into her head. “The circus team pulled the lioness away and delivered the girl to the Central Republican Hospital. “She is now in stable condition, there is no danger to her le.”  The child is being treated in intensive care. Wild animals continue to be used for performances in Russian circuses, including many touring troupes that go from place to place. The latest incident is likely to lead to increase calls to ban the use of performing predators like lions and bears.

Salvatore Mannino, , originally from Italy, was discovered in Edinburghs St Giles’ Cathedral - before claiming to Police Scotland that he had no idea who he was. Italian media say police searching for the missing man found searches on his laptop about the best way to disappear without a trace. Searches about the weather in Edinburgh were also found before he left his home country. It was also reported that Mr Mannino tried to close joint bank accounts belonging to him and his we, moving the money to accounts under her name only. He has has now been charged with “violating his family assistance obligations” as a result, according to Italian news sources.  Before leaving the family home, he left a briefcase with €, and a sheet of paper with a numerical sequence, a code which was deciphered by his eldest son, . Aerospace student Filippo told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera earlier this month: “It was a message Dad left me to decipher, I am sure of it, because he knew I am passionate about mathematical games.” Mr Mannino, a former supermarket manager, is said to have checked the weather forecast for Edinburgh and Aberdeen before leaving Italy. He was described as “tranquil” and “happy” before going missing and left his mobile phone behind, with the recent call history deleted. Mr Mannino, who claims to be unable to speak Italian, has been communicating in basic English. When police in Edinburgh were called to reports of a man taking unwell last month, he was not carrying any ID. Two weeks later officers issued an appeal to help identy a “man with no memory”.  During the public appeal for information, they used the Italian’s tattoos to help identy him. At the time, Constable Lesley Jack said: “This is a very unusual inquiry, as we have a member of the public who has no idea about who he is, where he is from or who we can call on his behalf. “As is standard practice, we have reviewed all relevant missing people and the man does not match the description of anyone currently reported missing. “We hope that, by issuing this detailed description, someone will recognise this male and come forward to assist with our inquiries.” Mr Mannino’s we and eldest child later flew to Edinburgh, but he claimed not to know who they were. He is being assessed at a psychiatric ward in Pisa, where doctors are yet to diagnose his condition.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain. Irvine#s Kyles team-mate Roddy MacDonald has also been selected and there are places for Oban Camanachd duo Lorne Dickie and Andrew MacCuish.The Scottish mantra in recent games has been to keep the ball on the ground and to use the wide open spaces to stretch the Irish defence and not allow the hurlers to build up a head of steam with their aerial game.Caberfeidh’s dead-ball expert Kevin Bartlett will again be key and he scored twelve of Scotland’s eighteen points a year ago.There are no rule changes as such this year but there will be an Irish referee, John Keane, which brings its own dimension.Garry Reid added: #The interpretation of the rules will be key. In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game. However there’s no doubt this will make for a fast pace as it will let the game flow and that’s important for the international to remain a spectacle for the supporters.#Scotland squad:Stuart MacDonald Glen MacKintosh The match, which starts at pm, will not be broadcast live this year but the match will be shown in full on BBC ALBA from pm on Saturday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"aray take honours in sporting start to dunoon mod","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThere is more to the Mòd than music and drams, and this year#s Royal National Mòd in Dunoon was launched with a festival of sport.Scotland’s biggest Gaelic cultural festival traditionally features shinty, and this year it was Inveraray and Col Glen adult teams contesting the Mòd Cup on Saturday October .A close and hard-fought contest  at Dunoon Stadium in wet conditions resulted in victory for Inveraray, who overcame the Glen  #  after a strong second half performance.Up at the Dunoon Grammar School all-weather pitches there was also a nine-aside women’s shinty match between Oban Lorn and Cowal Ladies, with the Oban team coming out on top -.The Mòd played host to the first ever Primary Schools’ Mòd Shinty Tournament, introduced to celebrate Scotland’s Year of Young People, in which Inveraray again came out on top, beating Kyles and Strachur by a goal to nil.In the Mòd Football Cup, Glasgow Islands came through with a  - win over local team Dunoon Amateurs, which even involved the Glasgow goalkeeper getting on the scoresheet.Chief Executive of An Comunn Gàidhealach, John Morrison, said: #We’ve had a great first weekend at the  Royal National Mòd in Dunoon.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car.

first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating

The choir loved it.\"On the plane to Catalonia - at the suggestion of the pilot - and at other points throughout the trip, the choir took the opportunity to sing whenever and wherever they could, especially in the beautul squares and open spaces of the Gothic Quarter around La Rambla.As the days progressed, whether singing or sight seeing, members were recognised increasingly.Men in kilts are an instant attraction, and this, combined with the gentsrsquo Catalonian coloured bright teeshirts bearing a line in Spanish from lsquoHavanarsquo, a piece from the choirrsquos repertoire, ensured a positive response everywhere.In the course of the few days they were congratulated and spoken to by people from all around the world including South America, the United States, Canada, all over Europe, Russia, India, the Middle East, the Far East and Australia.To cap this there was the warm welcome extended to the choir by the Spanish people.Accompanying the choir through all its derring-do was the InChorus mascot, Singu, a penguin given to the choir by the family of the late Celia Hayton, a much loved choir member.Musical Director, Aly Skidmore, added: ldquoInChorus decided over a year ago that Barcelona would be the perfect city in which to properly celebrate its first decade.\"The culture there embraces all the arts, but music particularly.

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers learn lifesaving first aid","story":"CDJFA groups have been learning basic first aid skills, from paramedic Lorne McArthur, which could help treat sports injuries.The youngster#s training included cleaning and bandaging up wounds, supporting broken bones, dealing with concussion and some CPR and  children in total took advantage of this opportunity.Imogen Todd practices resuscitation watched by other young players.

#a purse# which traps the fish.He said the real skill was not in catching the fish, but in finding them in the first place, at a time when there was no sonar.Nature was the most common guide with gannets, which feed on herring, and basking sharks, which eat the same plankton as the fish, giving away their location.Dennis explained that a single gannet once helped him land a massive catch which filled four boats, off the Tiree coast.Casting the Net, a collaborative project between the Clyde Fishermen#s Association and the Scottish Fisheries Museum, is an oral history project capturing the memories and experiences of the last remaining Clyde ring-net fishermen.The bus, bought on eBay, has been transformed into the project#s mobile hub.Jill de Fresnes, from the Clyde Fishermen#s

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus.

But there is also a fake Douglas, a counterfeit  Main Street, one that only exists online: the HQ, among other things, of a global corporation with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Copenhagen and beyond.This particular make-believe version of the draperrsquos shop has a two-storey glass and steel atrium, huge open-planned rooms and an army of hipster staff in designer glasses.It is, at least according to its own website, the Londonoffice of Falcon Business Services, an international ldquocreative advertising agency working for blue-chip clients like Starbucks, HM, Boeing, Cisco and even disgraced mogul Harvey Weinsteinrsquos now bankrupt movie-making concern.Falconrsquos internet offering may look slick ndashauthentic, it would be by far the biggest and most successful business in Scotlandrsquos under-pressure advertising sector ndash but the sitersquos gobbledygook English gives its fakery away.ldquoWe appreciate every culture, we are consist from many dferent culture from many country around the worlds, the agency boasts on its site about its ldquoLondon HQ in Douglas. ldquoThis place very big and cozy, this is our main office consist of large amount of employee across the world.How Falcon portrays its HQ, screen grab of its websiteBack at the real  Main Street, Lilli Clark bursts out laughing when she hears how Falcon describes her surroundings. Clark, with friend Sally Kerr, runs a small book-keeping practice at the old shop, including a ldquovirtual office where a Falcon Business Services is, indeed, registered.The pair find themselves on the edge of the surreal world of Scotlandrsquos notorious ldquotax haven firms: of ghost companies of here-today, gone-tomorrow anonymously owned corporate entities. That is because their address is the registered HQ of thousands of businesses, many created as global criminals exploit Britainrsquos lax and barely policed corporate transparency laws.Most are Scottish limited partnerships or SLPs, a kind of shell firm which anti-corruption campaign Transparency International describes as ldquoa vehicle of choice for money-laundering.Falcon is an SLP. There is no way of knowing who owns the business, how much money it turns over or evenit has anything to do with the website in its name.This, for Clark, is not funny. Because it means her address does not just feature on shlocky websites: it also stars in some of the worldrsquos biggest crime stories.Two years ago The Herald revealed ldquonumber  was the official home of firms at the centre of a major Ukrainian investigation in to allegedly corrupt side-payments on an arms export to the Middle East. Since then Douglas shell firms have rarely been out of the news.Clark stresses she knows nothing about any of the firms using her address. ldquoWe have no control over them whatsoever, she explains. ldquoWe want to get rid of them but we canrsquot.She sighs as she hears the latest on Douglas SLPs. That is because they number among a series of UK shell firms ndash with no identiable real world connection to Britain ndash which The Herald on Sunday has identied as being behind supposedly multi-million-dollar investments in the tyrannical Central Asian state of Uzbekistan.Just one SLP, called Quality Trade Supplies or QTS, is building a steel mill in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, for just over  million euros. This ldquoBritish investment was announced by Uzbekistanrsquos president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, with an official visit to its -hectare site, which, unlike Falconrsquos global HQ, is very real.Presidential press releaseTwo decades after the closure of Ravenscraig, a Scottish company is again investing in steel, albeit overseas. Or is it The Herald on Sunday has made multiple attempts to contact QTS, whose website says it has a representative office in Kazakhstan, as well as its official home at  Main Street, Douglas. We wanted to ask QTS who its owner was. The firm has failed to comply with new UK rules under which last year it should have named any ultimate beneficiary or PSC ndash a ldquoperson of signicant control.The firmrsquos website says the Tashkent Metallurgical Plant is a ldquostate project ndash while the state itself says it is a QTS project. The stated investment is one of the biggest carried out by a Scottish enterprise overseas in recent years.QTS on its site also said it was also building a km railway line with  stops across Kazakhstan, part of a major drive to improve transport links between China and Europe. That job, it said, would involve  construction workers. Again, this would be a nearly unprecedented venture for a Scottish firm.Uzbeks also have questions about who owns QTS. One prominent former Soviet oligarch has been named locally as being behind the firm. A London public relations firm acting on his behalf has denied any connection.Mirziyoyev has also given his official blessing ndash and visit ndash to another major ldquoBritish investment from a Douglas firm, a m cement factory in the underdeveloped western Uzbek region of Karakalpakstan.Shavkat MirziyoyevUzbekistanrsquos Ministry of Economy formally lists ldquoforeign investments in infrastructure or industry every year. These include a roll-call of SLPs with either opaque ownership or PSCs filed in the name of untraceable Uzbeks. At least five other Douglas SLPs are named in press reports or official bulletins as recent investors. None have transparent ownership or any real-world links to Lanarkshire.Uzbek authorities have also named a series of English and Welsh shell firms, mostly limited liability partnerships or LLPs, as ldquoforeign investors.Take Fortalia Consult, a now struck-off LLP. It put up m for a .m factory making washing machines, fridges and cookers. The plant, partly funded by the state National Bank of Uzbekistan, employed hundreds. LLPs have to provide more information on Britainrsquos corporate registry, including accounts. Fortalia, in its last year of existence, , made an operating profit of pound on a turnover of just over pound,. A company investing millions in a white appliances factory made a profit of under a tenner. It did, however, file a PSC. She was Uzbek.Official bulletins, government press releases and state-controlled media reports suggest SLPs and LLPs whose owners are either Uzbeks or unknown have made declared ldquoforeign direct investments of well over poundm in recent years.Other investments officially made by SLPs and LLPs are in real-world factories making everything from spinning equipment to probiotic dairy produce.One of the businesses investing in a major new business district, Tashkent City, is an Edinburgh SLP called Corso Solutions. Corso was created last year but has failed to comply with new rules under which it was supposed to say who its owner is. Fines for failure to comply are pound a day. None has ever been levied.TashkentHuman rights campaigners ndash Uzbek and international ndash have grave concerns about this. They want to know who is buying up chunks of the countryrsquos economy. They are especially concerned about equity and other investments in cotton, the nationrsquos biggest industry.Uzbekistan is currently reforming its cotton farms, which have a record of forced labour ndash slavery, effectively ndash and environmental abuses which have led to the near-disappearance of one of the worldrsquos biggest lakes, the Aral Sea. But reforms are only just beginning. They include partial privatisations that have seen SLPs and English shell firms buy stakes in both processing and picking enterprises.CottonTwo, Trontex of Stirling and Gratum Trading of Edinburgh, received import tax breaks under a Mirziyoyev decree. Both firms, like QTS, have filed at Companies House saying they have not yet attempted to identy a PSC.The Herald on Sunday has written to both Mirziyoyevrsquos press office in Tashkent and the Uzbek Embassy in London. We askedthe president knew who the beneficiaries of his tax breaks were. There was no reply. We also wrote askinghe was concerned that major ldquoforeign investors were failing to reveal who they were. Again, there was no reply.This worries Umida Niyazova. She is a journalist and campaigner who was jailed under Mirziyoyevrsquos predecessor, the authoritarian Islam Karimov. Now based in Berlin, she leads the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights .She says: ldquoThe cotton sector in Uzbekistan is entirely under the control of the state which sets the price of cotton and is the sole beneficiary of revenue from sales on the international market.\"Umida NiyazovaShe adds: ldquoUGF has been monitoring and reporting on state-organised forced labour in Uzbekistanrsquos cotton sector for over eight years. We can confirm that, despite some changes, mass mobilization of forced labour and extortion from organisations and employees to pay for cotton pickers is again ongoing during this yearrsquos cotton harvest, despite Mirziyoyevrsquos public commitments to eradicate it.ldquoFor decades, the production of cotton has been underpinned by a system ... in which Uzbekistanrsquos citizens are forcibly mobilised to pick cotton. This is a state-operated system of forced labour, in which the Uzbek government imposes regional cotton production quotas which are, in turn, allocated by regional officials to their sub-districts.ldquoRegional and district officials are responsible for meeting these quotas under threat of penalty.ldquoWe have observed a proleration of Uzbek entities registered as limited partnerships in Scotland and England, including a number of companies with direct ties to the cotton industry.ldquoWe are interested to know why these companies, in receipt of large swathes of foreign direct investment, want to register in Scotland. Why do these companies not disclose their ownership  Given that hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign direct investment are flowing into the country at this time, the UK government must ensure these companies are not a vehicle for money laundering.ldquoUzbekistanrsquos cotton sector has already disrupted the lives of millions. It would be criminalthey were to be robbed of revenue which should ultimately benefit the Uzbek people.Abandoned ships on the dried-out Aral SeaUzbek sources stress they have no evidence SLPs or LLPs investing in cotton or other industries are responsible for human rights abuses. Nor do they have evidence any nominally UK registered firms are fronts for government officials or others who wish to conceal their identities. They just want to know who is behind investment. They have reason to be concerned. SLPs have been widely abused where in the former Soviet Union, including as part of multi-billion-dollar schemes to launder money out of Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan.At last count, some  Uzbeks were named as the PSCs of SLPs. But multiple investigations reveal closer links. A nephew of former leader Islam Karimov in  was named as the effective controller of SLPs involved in a dispute over the ownership of hotels in Riga which culminated in an attempted gangland-style hit.Last year an international journalistic investigation alleged that Karimovrsquos youngest daughter, Lola, and her husband used three SLPs ndash two of which, Five Star Star Technology Support and Greenhall Management, are based in Douglas ndash as part of complex offshore scheme. None of the SLPs has named a PSC.Lola Karimova, from Getty ImagesMs Karimova is a multi-millionaire who last year launched her own fragrance at a party at the Cannes Film Festival attended by Juliette Binoche, Catherine Deneuve, Kristin Scott Thomas and Pamela Anderson.She denies detailed allegations of tax avoidance set out by journalists at a group called The Black Sea.This month Britainrsquos Serious Fraud Office announced it had begun a proceeds of crime investigation against Ms Karimovarsquos estranged elder sister, Gulnara, once touted as a replacement for her father.She is in prison near Tashkent on embezzlement charges, which she denies. British authorities are understood to be seeking to confiscate London properties linked to her and an associate. Swiss authorities have already seized some m in assets.Gulnara Karimova, from Getty ImagesMeanwhile, as The Herald revealed this year, The United Nations Development Programme has blacklisted five SLPs amid concerns over international aid fraud in Uzbekistan. The sanctions are against SLPs called Special Alliance Partnership, Investment Affairs, Trident Asia and Five Star Commercial Services.They are all registered either at  Main Street, or a flat in Edinburghrsquos Montgomery Street, number .The owners of this property, like Clark and Kerr, once ran a virtual office business. They too stress they have no control over the entities registered at what is their home. They also have tried and failed to get SLPs de-registered.Some SLPs have been transferred from Montgomery Street to Douglas. They include Tashkent steel mill builder QTS, whose website still has a map showing its Edinburgh HQ.Montgomery Street, EdinburghThe Montgomery Street flat has been the base for SLPs which played a key role in the -billion Russian Laundromat, one of the biggest and most elaborate money-laundering schemes ever uncovered.:A Baltic bank, a Belarussian bribe and a British embarrassmentNow government investigators in Argentina allege two SLPs using the address were used as part of one of the worldrsquos biggest bribery scandals.Earlier this year The Herald revealed the role played by Scottish shell firms in complex offshore structures used by a construction giant called Odebrecht to pay kickbacks to officials and politicians across Latin America and beyond. The so-called ldquomega scandal ndash nearly bn was paid out, Odebrecht admits ndash has rocked the western hemisphere and led to prosecutions against senior officials in multiple jurisdictions.A former president of Peru, who denies using an SLP based at a Glasgow law firm to take money infor a highway contract, is among those facing prosecution. A senior state oil official close to the outgoing president of Mexico also dismisses reports he took money from the construction firm through SLPs.In Argentina, government anti-corruption investigators have focused on a prominent entrepreneur called Jorge Rodriacuteguez, though he usually goes by the nickname ldquoCorcho, or ldquoCork.In a ldquobox office celebrity court case, Rodriacuteguez is accused of taking in bribes from Odebrecht, which was among companies bidding to build a metro line. He denies any wrongdoing.Corcho Rodriacuteguez, from YouTubeAn Argentinian government report suggests money was transferred the tax haven bank accounts of two SLPs to Uruguay. From there, investigators allege, Rodriacuteguez used his fleet of private plans to fly money in cash across the River Plate to a small airfield near Buenos Aires. Figures of up to m have been cited.The two SLPs named in official papers are Latin Financial and Capital Investment Enterprises, both of which were created and dissolved without ever filing any meaningful paperwork. Rodriacuteguez says he has no connection with the two Scottish firms. His Uruguayan accountants, in testimony, say they were his.The case continues. Rodriacuteguez ndash often described as a lobbyist ndash was part of a politically-linked Buenos Aires jetset often seen in the Uruguayan resort of Punto del Este.His we, Veroacutenica Lozano, hosts a chat show on Argentinian TV. His ex, former s film star Susana Gimeacutenez, has an even bigger rival programme and her own monthly glossy magazine, on whose cover she always features.Susana GimeacutenezAn Odebrecht official in Brazil, Marcio Faria do Bentos, earlier this year said there had been a smooth flow of illicit payments to Argentina until former president Neacutestor Kirchner died in  while his we, Cristina, ran Argentina. The system, Faria said, started ldquoticking smoothly again after he was contacted by Rodriacuteguez.Anti-corruption campaigners are more than aware of the absurdity of linking the fleshpots of Punta del Este or Cannes with Montgomery Street flat, with a derelict phone box in its front garden, or a Lanarkshire draperrsquos shop.The Buenos Aires metroBut Scotland ndash and the UK ndash is part of a world-wide machine for washing dirty money. Our SLPs and our LLPs are like the Swiss banks of old, the means to hide illicit wealth with a veil of British respectability.Graham Barrow, UK-based money-laundering expert, has been slowly but surely unpicking and exposing the system in a series of detailed essays. The Uzbek and Argentinian cases, he says, ldquohighlight yet again that this is a global problemwhich can only be solved by a global effort.But he adds: ldquoThe UK can make a huge contribution by better regulating these entities so that they donrsquot keep cropping up in far flung corners of the world for all the wrong reasons. The British Government is mulling reforms.Punta del Este, UruguayMeanwhile, back in the through-the-looking class world of fake Douglas, ldquoScottland, Falcon Business Services is hiring creatives.

The Herald on Sunday tried to contact Falcon. All its contact details were bogus, its telephone was , its fax . Britain has still to get the number of its fake firms.So what are SLPs SCOTTISH Limited Partnerships, to give them their proper name, were once just a means for farmers to share fields.Then some lawyers figured out such structures made tax-efficient vehicles for managing equity funds. And others realised they were also enticing for people who want to avoid more than just tax.Writer Oliver Bullough has explored the murky world of international offshore finance ndash and its effect on some of the planetrsquos poorest nations ndash for his book Moneyland. He has long watched SLPs being abused.ldquoSLPs and shell structures like them are absolutely crucial to anyone who has wealth to hide, he explains. ldquoWithout them, it would be impossible for crooks and thieves ndash whether theyrsquore rulers of former Soviet states, or leaders of drugs cartels ndash to move their wealth out of the shadows and into the legitimate economy.\"Bulloughs bookHe adds: ldquoSLPs are useful to crooks because, unlike limited partnerships where in the UK, they have legal personality and thus can own bank accounts and other assets, enter into contracts, and take on debt. If the SLPrsquos partners are offshore companies, then their ownership is completely opaque.ldquoThe great advantage of Britain as a place to register a company is that the company looks legitimate, because itrsquos British, but really is not. Our money-laundering regime is so lax, and Companies House doesnrsquot check the accuracy of any information supplied to it. This is why British structures are almost iniably found in the biggest financial scandals.The abuse of SLPs, Bullough stresses, is not a victimless crime. ldquoMore than a trillion dollars a year is stolen from the worldrsquos poorest countries, devastating their economies and spreading misery and destitution, he says. ldquoThat would not be possible without shell structures like SLPs, and itrsquos imperative the UK Government acts to reform them to they can no longer be misused in this way.A map of just some of the SLP scandals in recent yearsA spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"The UK is leading the global fight against money laundering. \"Changes to the law last year have increased the transparency of these financial arrangements, reducing the likelihood of them being used for illegal purposes.ldquoWe carefully developed our recent reforms to further prevent these crimes without harming the legitimate businesses and pensions that invest through limited partnerships.Registrations of SLPs have fallen in the last year after new PSC reguilations were introduced and, crucially, banks in Latvia started refusing to handle their accounts.Comment: Alison Thewliss on why SLP reform cannot waitMore than three months have passed since the UK Government closed its consultation on the reform of limited partnerships, and despite calls for recommendations to be published, nothing has been forthcoming.Today we see yet more evidence linking limited partnerships to opprobrious behaviour abroad this time with regards cotton production in Uzbekistan.Agencies such as Amnesty International, and the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights, have gone to great s to expose the coercive and manipulative nature of this industry.Alison ThewlissThe purported involvement of financial vehicles registered in the UK ndash with little or no information offered on ultimate ownership ndash should be of serious concern to UK Government Ministers.Unfortunately, thatrsquos not likely to be the case as far as the UK Government is concerned. A volley of evidence has been sent their way, but met only with indference.The UK Government must take a firm stance on limited partnerships being used to fund corrupt activities and perpetuate human-rights abuses, and stop ignoring the scandal that is continuing to take place on their doorstep.Alison Thewliss is the SNP MP for Glasgow Central"},{"url":null,"title":"lord-adonis-scottish-labour-should-lead-the-way-in-calling-for-a-brexit-vote","story":"Now, though, we are in the fight of our lives to stop this Brexit mess.

In leaving aside questions about Scotlandrsquos relationship to the UK - for now - she has given us a chance of delivering for the Scottish people on the critical and urgent question of the UKrsquos relationship with our biggest and most important allies and trading partners.

They also called on the Scottish government to tackle the problem with action, not words.The \"paid by the minute\" scandal centres on the care industry where councils outsource care at home to private or charitable companies. Care staff are electronically monitored ndash clocking in and out of a clientrsquos home ndash using technology such as mobile phones or iPads.As an example,a carer has five jobs in an hour each lasting six minutes then they will be paid by the minute for a total of  minutes. If the worker is on the Scottish living wage ndash pound. an hour ndash this would see them earn approximately pound. for an hourrsquos work, or just under  pence per minute. Many are not paid for the time in between jobs, or for travel to and from jobs.Scottish Care, which represents private care providers, estimates that the practice of \"paying by the minute\" occurs in half of Scotlandrsquos  council areas. An estimated  per cent ndash or  people ndash of the private care workforce, which stands at ,, are on zero-hours contracts, where most of the \"paid by the minute\" work is found. However, the numbers on ZHCs rises to - per cent in the sector of \"older peoplersquos care\".Care providers and carers are also penalisedworkers stay over the allotted time per visit, in the event of a client being ill or distressed.Scottish Care said: ldquoOver the last few years Scottish Care has continually argued for improvements to conditions which make employment in the care sector precarious for too many iniduals. One of these is the call to offer properly funded contracts to providers to enable them to reduce dependency on zero-hour contracts ... While admittedly some staff desire the flexibility that such contracts provide them with, from our research the vast majority of providers wish to move to a situation where adequate funding makes full-time contracts for the care workforce a possibility.ldquoThe main reason for the existence of zero-hours contracts is the discriminatory practice around the way in which care is bought from charitable and private providers by the public authorities. A local authority only pays for the work which is done rather than what may be intended. This makes it impossible to guarantee hours for many, especially smaller care providers.\"Scottish Care believes that we need to radically change the way we commission and buy care services ... At the moment many, especially smaller organisations, are effectively paid by the minute and therefore by extension unless the provider has its own reserves and assets the worker is paid by the minute. This is no way to deliver care in the st century.ldquoWe are faced with a scenario where workers are pressurised to get tasks done in as quick a time as possible and are penalisedthey are late for their next client. For the person receiving the care this makes the whole experience less than dignied despite the best efforts of inidual care workers ... This is especially unacceptable when we are talking about supporting people with palliative and end-of-le care.Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said: \"There is something very wrong about a local authority treating its own staff fairly and well and yet treating the staff of services they buy in, whether they are employed by a charity or private care provider, in a manner which is little less than exploitative. Workers are made to clock in and clock out and their organisations are only being paid by the minute, and even thena worker is late or stays longer because someone needs more help or is ill they are being penalised.ldquoThese electronic call monitoring systems are treating care staff asthey cannot be trusted. They do not give dignity or value to a critical workforce. If we ever want to create a fair system of work we need a fair system for commissioning care.\"We have a massive challenge to attract people to do the fundamentally important job of care. People are being put off because of unfair conditions imposed by local authorities upon care organisations. How can we expect human-rights-based care in Scotland when we have created a system which denies the basic rights to the care worker and their employer \"Jim McCourt, one of Scotlandrsquos most prominent trade unionists who runs the Inverclyde Advice and Employment Rights Centre in Greenock, brought the issue of care workers being paid by the minute to the attention of The Herald on Sunday.\"Itrsquos the ultimate in the gig economy,\" says McCourt. He blamed the issue on care providers bidding against each other for council contracts and creating ldquoa race to the bottom in the market. ldquoThey bid with prices they canrsquot meet and it is their workers who suffer,\" he said.\"These private care companies are funded by the public purse as they are contracted by councils ndash so our tax pounds are propping up this system,\" said McCourt, adding: \"This is about looking after the most vulnerable people in society. We are looking at a value set here ndashpeople think there is money to be made in this way out of caring for the sick and elderly then there is something very wrong, especiallythe public purse is being used.\"One of Scotlandrsquos most senior care officials, who wished to speak anonymously, described the practice as \"hypocritical and obscene\".\"To impose penalties because a care worker has stayed longer than was thought necessary with a client who is distressed or unwell is the very antithesis of what the care profession is about. We donrsquot treat nurses like. This is the worst type of precarious employment. The current system needs to end.A spokesperson for Cosla, the Scottish council umbrella organisation, said: ldquoCouncils work closely with the providers in their area to deliver and commission social care services.

Alan worked for the company ndash the biggest parcel provider after the Post Office ndash from .He saw an advert for an ldquoowner driver franchise with the company, billed as self-employment, and thought it would be a perfect fit for him. As self-employed Alan could work when he wanted, have weekends with his family, and be his own boss. Today, Alan describes the job as a ldquomassive lie.What Alan experienced is something campaigners call bogus self-employment ndash a growing phenomenon in the UK where employers bring someone on as self-employed but treat them asthey were a member of staff. That means they get none of the perks of being staff ndash they have to pay their own tax and national insurance, and they donrsquot get sick pay or holiday pay ndash but all of the drawbacks. ldquoWhen the bosses said jump, we had to say lsquohow high rsquo,Alan said.Alan got only two weeks holiday a year, had to work every Monday to Friday, as well as weekends when ordered, and when he worked there drivers were fined poundthey took a day off sick.

He had diabetes and had been charged by DPD after attending a specialist renal appointment. He went on to miss other appointments. He collapsed twice at work.His we says Lane was vomiting blood but still went to work due to his fear of being fined. On the day of his death, he completed his deliveries but suffered a heart attack when he arrived home and later died in hospital. In February, one month after Lanersquos death, DPD began to phase out fines and abolished them altogether in July. Alan says: ldquoIt is a disgrace that it took the death of a decent man to bring this about. It was a Victorian system.Alan also had to hire the van he drove from the company for nearly pound a month and pay for fuel and repairs. UK Government rules permit a maximum of  hoursrsquo driving in any working day ndash but Alan says he often spent  hours behind the wheel.Like all workers in the gig economy, it was the precarious nature of his employment which left Alan most vulnerable. ldquoWe were afraid to say anything. The threat was that you could be dismissed at any moment and told your services were no longer required so we did what we were told ndash we all have mortgages and mouths to feed, he said.Fair employment campaigners, like the Better Than Zero campaign run by the STUC in Scotland, believe many corporations can only generate the profits they do thanks to their employment practices ndash which often involve no contributions to sick pay, pensions, holidays, tax and national insurance.

She added: ldquoMost are migrant workers with little English and they just take it as they feel it would be too hard to get another job.Emma also told of shts being cancelled at the last minute. In the restaurant where she works the biggest problem is that staff have no contracts at all. There was also delayed payment of wages to staff, short-changing for overtime, and staff being forced into split shtsthe restaurant was quiet ndash this would see a waitress told to take an unpaid break of two or three hours between lunch and dinner. ldquoIt seems like the employment policy is just to treat people like s**t, she said.Bad employment practices can also be reflected in a bad attitude to customers.

After multiple staff departures, she found herself working  hour days.She was one of the few members of staff to receive pay slips. Sandra pestered the owners for correct paperwork as she wanted to ensure her tax and national insurance were being paid. Most other staff made no such demands. Suppliers were also paid cash in hand.ldquoOne week we were all paid cash in hand and told that tax was still being paid for us ndash but how did we know that was true  Sandra said. ldquoMost of my pay slips also had the wrong tax and national insurance information.

Basically, the bosses were like greedy factory owners from the th century ndash they couldnrsquot get enough money and they didnrsquot care about staff.Sandra also spoke of bullying. On one occasion, staff had brought in their own food as they were working at a wedding reception all day. They left their lunches in bags in the staff room. A director tied the bags together and took bets on how long it would take hungry staff to get their food. ldquoThe impression you got is that we were not human in their eyes, says Sandra.Another member of staff describes her time at the restaurant as a ldquonightmare.

Social enterprises are meant to help good causes ndash an example of a social enterprises doing what they are meant to do would be the Big Issue magazine which runs as a business but helps the homeless. Often, social enterprises get financial breaks and incentives from government.ldquoI have no idea how a waitress can be considered self-employed, but I needed the work, she said. ldquoThis was the most dodgy place I ever worked for. I also had all the down sides of a zero-hours contract ndash so I didnrsquot now how many hours I was getting or when I would get called on to work.Nerys said she worked for four months at the social enterprise and saw one person in all that time come to use the services for the disabled and elderly.The STUCrsquos Better Than Zero campaign is investigating this social enterprise and others.lsquoI ended up with anxiety ndash sitting in bed crying at nightrsquoBelinda was just  when she went to work as a waitress in a well-known Scottish restaurant.

That terries the rest of the workforce.It also plunges people into poverty, says McCourt ndash as many agency workers were unemployed before entering the gig economy anddismissed will have to endure the wait for their benefits to be reinstated. Many have been sent by job centres to agencies and told to take the job the agencies offer them or risk being sanctioned.Amazon ndash which has around , UK workers and recognises no trade union ndash announced this month that it was raising wages for its staff employees. The move was hailed as a positive step forward by a company which has been under fire over employment practices for years. The Scottish Government had been criticised for giving Amazon pound.m in taxpayer money.Last month, though, new rules were announced that there would be no state handouts in Scotland for firms which did not pay the living wage. Shortly afterwards, Amazon announced it would raise wages for employees. What went pretty much unnoticed though was that Amazon simultaneously decided to phase out its bonus and stock award programmes for hourly workers.ldquoWhat that all amounts to, says McCourt, ldquois no benefit to the workers. Staff are furious but not surprised.In separate investigations, McCourt has also come across an increasing number of employers using absence management policies which seem designed to sack staff who have been off sick. ldquoThere is a growing occupational health industry which works hand-in-hand with employers to get staff dismissed, he said, citing cases where employers ignored details of sickness provided by GPs and consultants, but instead relied on assessments from private occupational health advisors which results in dismissal. ldquoThis is the world we live in, says McCourt.He has also uncovered a new scandal in the gig economy ndash workers being paid literally by the minute in the private care sector.As the care sector becomes increasingly privatised, companies are being hired by councils to provide care to the sick and elderly in their homes. Many care staff are on zero-hours contracts ndash but thousands are also paid by the minute.ldquoItrsquos the ultimate in the gig economy, says McCourt. ldquoCompanies bid against each other for a contract and it is a race to the bottom. They bid with prices they canrsquot meet and it is their workers who suffer.An example of a care worker paid by the minute would be as follows: a care worker has five jobs in an hour ndash going to the homes of clients to help with their personal needs and medication ndash each job takes six minutes, meaning the carer is viewed as having worked  minutes in an hour.ldquoThese private care companies are funded by the public purse, says McCourt, ldquoas they are contracted by councils ndash so our tax pounds are propping up this system. There is a big dference here to other employment practices as we are not talking about stacking CDs in a warehouse ndash this is about looking after the most vulnerable people in society.ldquoWe are looking at a value set here ndashpeople think there is money to be made in this way out of caring for the sick and elderly then there is something very wrong, especiallythe public purse is being used.Background: Workers are stepping back in time to darker ageA BROWSE through the files of Better Than Zero is like stepping into a time machine and travelling back to the days of the dark satanic mills of the Industrial Revolution.Itrsquos a litany of employees begging their boss for work, staff having to pander to management in order to secure shts, of bullying, harassment, humiliation, low wages, people living hand to mouth, and the steady erosion of pride and dignity. There are examples of female staff who have asked to change shts being texted by their male manager saying: \"My we is out tonight, why donrsquot you come round and then I will change your sht.\"\"The work is sold to the employee as flexible,\" says Sarah Collins of BTZ, \"but there is no flexibility for the worker.\" Staff are expected to take what shts are offered to them, regardless of how few or how many the hours are ndashthey cause a fuss and stand up for themselves itrsquos unlikely they will get any more work. \"All the control is with the employer,\" Collins adds.One of the latest issues within precarious employment is the rise of questionable practices within a small minority of social enterprise firms ndash companies meant to be doing a social good and often in receipt of financial support from the public purse. Some social enterprises are hiring staff on zero hours contracts ldquothen quickly sacking or dismissing themthey raise any concerns. BTZ spoke of firms claiming to be involved in sustainable transport initiatives pressurising and bullying staff on zero hour contracts, or paying cash in hand. There are reports of similar behaviour by social enterprise companies refurbishing kitchen goods or furniture for the poor and elderly to buy at cheap rates.\"On the surface they look great, and there are plenty of social enterprises doing great work but the model has been perverted by a few for bad reasons,\" BTZ said.\"Bogus self-employment\" is another new problem ndash it crossed over from the gig economy where some food delivery drivers were hired on a self-employed basis and is now in many sectors. The organisation cites the case of a beautician in a nail bar who was taken on as self-employed but was told by management when to come in, when to go home, and how much to charge.\"They are not self-employed at all,\" says BTZ. \"It is just a cost saving exercise as the employer is not paying tax, national insurance, sick pay, holiday pay, or pension contributions. There is a big issue here of the exchequer potentially missing out on huge amounts of tax.Self-employment has massively increased since the financial crash of . The largest increase is among women in the following three occupations: cleaners, child minders and hairdressers. Most people drt in and out of self-employment as they look for more stable, less precarious jobs.\"The Scottish Government is projecting Scotland as a wonderful place to visit, but who is checking on the labour conditions of the people in the tourism industry,\" BTZ says.At the core of the problems with zero hours contracts, in particular, is the bullying it seems to enable in the worst managers ndash staff who want to work as many hours as possible are unlikely to defend themselvestreated badly by their boss. Precarious employment also affects young workers in their late teens and early s more than other age groups.\"Bullying is everywhere,\" says BTZ. \"This leads to burn out, mental health problems...unemployment may be at an all time low but the human cost is Dickensian. Couple all this with the housing situation and you see that precarious work leads to precarious lives.

Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmA special fund to help retell the remarkable tale of the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow almost  years ago has been launched by Orkney Islands Council .

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority. We will continue to work closely with Scottish Government, other agencies and industry at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years. Mr Robertson said: \"We were particularly glad to have a representative of the Inkson family with us, in the form of J.K.rsquos daughter, Helen, and we were pleased to hear a message of greeting from his son, Kerr, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\"Kerr wrote of his pride in the job his father had done, developing and managing the exchanges. He also wished us all a happy evening together. We remembered with fondness, all those who were no longer with us, and especially J.K.Inkson himself, to whose memory all drank a fitting toast.\"Warm thanks were also expressed to Sandra Collard who helped maintain contacts and organise the event and Marie-Anny who \"emulated mdash and surpassed mdash her fictional compatriot, Monsieur Poirot, in locating so many of our Belgian friends\".Although Marie-Anny was the only surviving Belgian veteran who felt able to undertake the long journey to Ross-shire, Mr Robertson said: \"There has been a great exchange of email addresses, and it looks like the ether will be buzzing with electronic correspondence between old friends in Britain and Belgium.\"Well done, Marie-Anny and Sandra, for giving us one of the most memorable days of our lives, and thank you Alistair, for your magical photographic memories of this wonderful occasion!\"Monday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Monday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Grown in sunlight, without hydroponic lights, and sprayed with a fine mist of salt water from the sea nearby. They taste and smell like the tomatoes we grew up with,” she says. A tomato whose taste is down to the concentration of minerals in soil enriched by millennia of stratication of lava, and as she talks, she’s taking me on a journey where taste is all about time. In a world of rolling news and   Twitter feeds, with , people following her Instagram posts, a new restaurant opened this year and another opening next month, “call it five” books to her name and another out this month, chef and food writer Gizzi Erskine wants us all to slow right down. That’s why her new cookery book is called Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over, designed to teach the art of slow cooking and how to serve up stews, soups and hearty sauces. She’s fed up with quick cheats and cutting corners and wants us to prod the produce, take time trying out techniques and linger lovingly over the creation of a kale, spinach and ricotta conchiglioni. It’s time to stew, braise, bake, poach and roast.“We are so short of time in our lives that we forget that cookery does take time,” she says. Not that one of the first proponents of the pop-up restaurant doesn’t have time for fast food: “Sometimes you’ve just got to have something on your plate instantly, so you batch cook at weekends and have quick ready meals for the week. But I think losing yourself in the cookery process is therapy as well.”Taking time out to enjoy the process is close to Erskine’s heart after a busy year that started with her opening her first solo restaurant, The Dining Room, at Mare Street Market in a former office block in Hackney, and will end with the opening of vegetarian burger chain, Filth, a joint business venture with model-turned-nutritionist Rosemary Ferguson aimed at delivering healthy food to hedonists. The pair met at a festival, music being a passion of Erskine’s from hosting a cookery and cabaret stage at Latitude to what she calls a “penchant” for musicians, including Klaxons rocker Jamie Reynolds who she dated and split up with in . All this and her latest book, out this month, Gizzi doesn’t appear to be someone to whom you’d attach the adjective “slow”. After leaving school at  and home at , Gizzi – short for Griselda – was in a hurry to get on with le and success came early. While working as a body piercer in Camden, she trained at Leith’s School of Food and Wine in , graduated top of her year and won an internship at BBC Good Food magazine, writing and styling while working in kitchens and starting her own catering company. With her psychobilly flicky eyeliner and beehive hairstyle she was made for TV, and Channel  gave her her own show, Cook Yourself Thin, followed by Cookery School and Drop Down Menu. More TV followed with Sky Living. At the same time, she was turning out cookery books including Gizzi’s Kitchen Magic and Skinny Weeks  Weekend Feasts as well as writing for magazines and newspapers including InStyle and Sunday Times Style. And then there were the pop-ups, from a gourmet pie shop to food inspired by the New York Korean hole-in-the-wall scene, and one in Edinburgh during the Festival.But it’s time to slow down and talk about Slow. At , Erskine is at pains to point out she has been doing this for a long time. “I just wanted to be respected for the job I do it’s not just about how I look. I work very, very hard, I’m probably one of the hardest-working people in the industry. I’m good at my job and want people to recognise it. And I think that’s why people like Mark Hix, Angela Hartnett and Tom Kerridge, all the big guns, have always taken massive care of me, and that’s because they trust me as a cook. I dunno, it’s probably all my own shit to be honest, in my own head, but I just feel like I’ve been doing this for a long time now.”Erskine’s big purpose is to get us to slow down, embrace ingredients and technique – and for her own part, she also wants to be taken more seriously. Always a huge fan of methodology, she found the quick and easy recipes approach demanded by media for cookery frustrating. “I’m like, ‘You know what, I’m a chef, a real chef, and I really enjoy the process of cookery and I love technique – it’s what I get my kicks from’. “I’m really pleased with this book,” she says. “You know when you talk about rock stars making a brilliant album with a load of banging hits, that’s what these recipes are like. Often you lose something in a book, but they’ve kept my voice.“And one of the great things is it’s the first one I’m not on the cover. I’ve begged not to be on the cover of every single one – I think it’s a celebrity chef thing – but I don’t buy those books, I buy ones written by proper cookery writers or real old school chefs. “I want this book to stand for something. I don’t want it to be just like I’m spoiled and I’ve been on the telly and can write lovely recipes. I actually have a big purpose and I want to get out there and make changes,” she says. Not that Erskine doesn’t care about the visuals – like the shiny bob that replaced the beehive a couple of years ago – but she’s moved on from Cook Yourself Thin and Skinny Weeks  Weekend Feasts, having a more complex take on body issues these days. Of a recent post online where she mentioned putting on weight, she says: “I did that without thinking, but , people responded, so it touched a lot of people. But I don’t want it to be a thing that defines me. I put on that weight because I worked my arse off this year, setting up businesses, writing a book and helping build a house. It’s been an exhilarating, tiring  months and I lost my way in my diet. Is that the biggest thing you’ve ever been through  Absolutely not. Do I stand for more than this  Yeah! You know what, I don’t want to talk about it any more because I don’t think it’s very feminist. “Obviously my image and having a certain style has been a part in what I do and that’s been brilliant I probably wouldn’t be doing what I do without it. I’ve done a lot of TV – the last one was a Korean show for BBC One, My Seoul Food, where I got to live in Korea for four months, maybe one of my best experiences of all time. And I got to work with Idris Elba and Paloma Faith and Rankin on Sky  HD, and I pinch myself every day about that sort of thing. But the stuff I like best is educating people, showing them new things. “I’ve been doing this for more than  years, and won awards before I did TV, I’ve written a column for the Sunday Times for almost three years. I’ve earned my stripes. I’m a perfectionist and meticulous and I really want to be known for being good. That’s the first and foremost thing.”The wake-up call that her style was being valued over her stew came for Erskine when her annual appearance in the Evening Standard newspaper’s , Most Influential List saw her listed under “Party Girl” rather than “Food”. “I was like, f***, that is the worst thing! It’s my choice to do social media, because I love my fans and the fact I can have conversations with them, but when your lestyle choices make people see you dferently that’s no good. It was my fault and I deserved it. I thought I want to be recognised for doing my job, and I am good at my job, and it was important I stuck with it and showed how much I respect my industry. “Now I’m back in the Food section,” she says, satisfied, “have been for the past three or so years.” During her childhood, the family travelled a lot because of her mother’s﻿ work – Erskine and her two sisters spent time in Thailand, Switzerland and Spain after her parents’ orce. As Erskine puts it now, with a laugh: “I’ve had a very weird upbringing, there’s lots of weird shit gone on.” Food was always part of her le, with her mother teaching her recipes – her influence is in the new book. There’s also the Scottish grandmother from Edinburgh, Mona, a brilliant cook who married a Polish Jew who escaped the Nazis, and flitted between Communism, clairvoyance and Buddhism. She died when Erskine was a child, but came through to Erskine years later when she visited a spiritualist. “They said ‘Mona’s here’. I was still piercing at this stage and she said either you or your mother need to cook, because you both want to, so I went home and asked my mother what it was all about. She said, ‘That’s your grandma’, and it was on the nose. Mona has come through again, this time in the book with a Jewish chicken soup recipe.” Erskine’s father was also Scottish, from Dumfries, and she lived there briefly when she was very young. She still calls Scotland “the motherland”, priding herself on her mince recipe.It was the death of Erskine’s father on the day of her first GCSE exam that saw her leave school immediately at . “School wasn’t for me anyway,” she says, “and it turned out later that I had ADHD, which made sense. In  Erskine was officially diagnosed with the disorder and she’s very upfront about how cooking helps and is helped by it.“I can be hyper-focused and hyperactive at the same time, probably everyone ’s nightmare. So I’m either distracted and it’s knock me on the head to get attention, or bouncing off the walls and I find it very hard to listen. So cooking is like exercise, it’s therapy for me. “There’s also a side where I felt too clever for school, which is really knobby, and no-one really explained the importance of education. I was a bit of a dick in that I chose to leave but I was a nightmare at , going out, having a wild time, and my father died, so it was a bit of an excuse for me not to go back. “I was devastated by his death, but I didn’t face it. It took me five to ten years to really accept it. I put my head in the clouds and wanted to party. But now as a grown up, I don’t necessarily believe leaving school was the worst decision. “What would I have doneI’d stayed  Gone to art school maybe, but I don’t think I would have learnt as much as I did going out to work. I started piercing when I was  and I loved it and it set me up with the particular skills that I learnt from and transferred to cookery. That sounds like a ridiculous synergy, but I learnt things like wanting to be the best and investing in something, going on courses to improve. It was a brilliant lesson in how to be good at something,” she says.Erskine still loves piercing but has reduced her own ironmongery from  or  to just the one. As to its whereabouts – “I’m not going to tell you that.” She laughs. After seven years of piercing Erskine decided to pursue her love of cooking and enrolled at Prue Leith’s prestigious London cookery school, still piercing and working in restaurants to fund her studies. “My family is quite bohemian and we were very broke,” she says. “I lived on my own and ended up squatting, doing school in the day then in kitchens every night, and piercing and restaurants at the weekend, and yeah, probably partying too hard. So I lost it, I was just so exhausted.” Physically and emotionally something had to give and Erskine thought about quitting, but the school wanted her to stay and loaned her the fees for the last term. “They were so kind and saw something in me, so I was like f***, I’ve gotta do this!” Success followed, but nothing has given Erskine more satisfaction than her first solo restaurant at Mare Street Market, where she was hands-on in the kitchen until preparations for veggie burger eatery Filth took her away recently.“Cooking really good food people are coming back for… It was something I took a long time to get my head around, whether I wanted to be involved in business or not, but it’s been really satisfying and confidence-boosting,” she says. With Mare Street Market under her belt, she’s putting the finishing touches to the sustainable burger enterprise and is evangelical about the vegan burger she’s concocted with sidekick Ferguson. “We’ve spent a lot of time messing around over a cauldron,” she says. “We’ve made this patty that’s a real game-changer. Totally vegan, it feels similar to a traditional beef burger but has more protein, fibre, nutrition, and all the umami. I sound a bit Miss World,” she laughs, “but I’d love to make an impact with it, because what we eat is crucial and it’s time for a revolution in food.” So with a busy year behind her, Erskine might be forgiven for retreating to the warehouse she’s converting in Hackney with her ex-boyfriend, curling up with her cats Kimchiand Ponzuand taking time out to slow cook a ragu. “No! I’ve got another interview to do, five minutes ago!” she says, before briefly explaining her domestic set-up. “We were together for ten years and then broke up for five and now we’re building a house together. We’re best friends now, and it’s a lovely little set-up. We love each other, it’s great,” she says.With  just around the corner Erskine is happy with her le as it is. “I feel ageless. I don’t feel the need to settle down and have kids. I’m really satisfied and have a very fulfilled le and get kicks from so many things. I don’t have time for anything . “I’d like to do more cookery books but I want them to be for the right reasons. I don’t care about just churning them out. I want to spend time thinking about the next step, spend time making it good.” Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over by Gizzi Erskine is out now, published by Harper Collins at £©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820561.1540806636!/image/image.jpg","title":"ikm launches new mobile mapping technology","story":"Falkirk-based firm IKM Surveying, part of IKM Consulting Group, is launching a new mobile mapping service to boost the efficiency and safety of road survey procedures.Following a successful pilot with road maintenance provider Bear Scotland, IKM will launch its new technology at RoadExpo on  October and  November.It uses a vehicle-mounted system, multi-camera imaging and field software to capture data of roads, rail, land and waterways, as well as geographic information systemdata collection and asset management to efficiently map transport and infrastructure projects.

Having a conviction for driving without appropriate insurance that he picked up while a transport minister was not a recommendation.Every day the actions of Humza Yousaf suggest he is unfit for that office and the First Minister does not act, compounds the question surrounding her judgement. If the minister had any sense of self-awareness, and what is appropriate behaviour for a justice minister, he would spare Nicola Sturgeon her blushes and decide to relinquish his role and spend more time with his family. With Humza Yousaf’s penchant for being in the limelight such voluntary sacrice is as unlikely as the First Minister admitting she can be so demonstrably wrong in judging people.In an interview published this month Mr Yousaf talked freely of his upset at the criminal investigation into his former colleague and leader, Alex Salmond, on accusations of sexual misconduct. He described it as “utterly heartbreaking” but there was no report of his thoughts for those who might be intimidated about bringing such charges against men of power, no revelations about his concerns towards how alleged victims might feel. There was no sense of awareness how he – as Justice Secretary – might make those women, and other women in similar positions who are yet to speak up – feel by showing more concern for Salmond than for women potentially abused. Nor did he appear aware he might be contributing to a public perception – before any possible future jury trial – that Alex Salmond’s character is beyond question.Surely he should have refused to comment on the matter at all, other than to acknowledge the legal proceedings were in place and precluded him from revealing his own thoughts  The week then really took off when an Edinburgh Labour councillor, Professor Scot Arthur, who like Humza Yousaf, is a highly active tweeter, invited his followers to take part in a Twitter poll that he devised. For those that do not Tweet I can advise this is a common practice, sometimes in seriousness to establish opinion, sometimes in jest to poke fun at others. Cllr Arthur’s question was, “What attracted Humza Yousaf to politics ” A The   attacks, B The Iraq War, or C The photo calls Now I have not happened to mention Humza Yousaf’s religion in this article so far, which is intentional, because I do not think his religionshould matter in his conduct as Cabinet Secretary for Justice. For Humza Yousaf, however, Cllr Arthur’s Tweet was prejudiced against his faith and race, indeed it was so hateful that when it was brought to his attention he wrote to the leader of Edinburgh Labour Council Group and called for Cllr Arthur’s immediate suspension.Now at this stage you may want to read the Tweet again. It suggests there might be three reasons Mr Yousaf went into politics and one might guess that the point of such a poll was to ridicule the subject by putting the narcisstic attraction of photo calls as the last answer. But why list   and the Iraq War – was that racist or Islamophobic Actually the origins of those first two answers is that only a few days before Humza Yousaf had said in the same interview that   – when he was -years-old – was “hugely to do with where I am today”. This appeared to conflict with a previous comment given to the Herald where Mr Yousaf said, “The Iraq war was the trigger for my politics”.So was it   or the Iraq war – or was it that politics is attractive to people who like being in the limelight  A political opponent had spotted an inconsistency and no doubt thought it worth calling out the Justice Secretary’s forgetfulness.  was a crime against humanity in which, other than the evil perpetrators, hundreds of innocent Muslims died. As is often the case in Islamist terrorist attacks, be they bombings, shootings or vehicles mowing people down, Muslims are innocent victims too. The same goes for the Iraq War – which was prosecuted against a secular state and where people of all religions and none, and of many races died. The US Secretaries of State during its time were Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, both black Americans. Many Muslims served in Operation Desert Storm and the campaigns that followed. It would be a perversion of the truth to suggest it was a war against Islam, or even a particular section of Islam.Nevertheless, such is the nature of social media outrage that it was not long that Cllr Arthur felt he had to unreservedly apologise for his Tweet and deleted it, while the Labour council leader reprimanded him publicly. I know I am not alone in looking at that tweet and not seeing racist or Islamophobic abuse. What I see is a politician undermining real cases of abuse by overreacting and playing the hate crime card. Humza Yousaf is a regular tweeter who is not backwards at attacking opponents and often winds-up supporters of Rangers FC. It’s never racist or sectarian, of course.The problem for those, like Mr Yousaf, who wish to flaunt their opinions about possible objectionable behaviour of others, is that it can easily lead to hypocrisy when comment is dficulta new example is too close to home. Unfortunately for the Justice Secretary, who is a Glasgow politician and can be expected to know what is happening in his own domain, an SNP Councillor, Russell Robertson, appeared in Glasgow Sherf Court last week after being charged with aggravated religious prejudice for allegedly calling his neighbour an “Orange bastard”.Was there a tweet from the Justice Minister  Maybe a letter to the SNP council leader, Susan Aitken, calling for his immediate suspension  No, he was utterly silent. Either the Justice Minister is embarrassed by Mr Robertson’s alleged bigoted behaviour or is at last learning that keeping his counsel is more befitting for the Justice Secretary. A long period away from Twitter is the least he could do for his leader.Brian Monteith is a director of think-tank Global Britain©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4821070.1540754779!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch me too movements should embrace scotland s witches","story":"Was I alone in being repelled by the advertising pitch for this weekend#s Paisley#s Halloween Festival #Inspired by the town#s dark and deathly th century witch history #How can a weekend of spooky fun be “inspired” by the gruesome killing of seven people, whose only crimes appear to have been using herbal remedies and forecasting the weather by studying bird movements and cattle behaviour  Four female and two male “witches” were strangled on Paisley Gallow Green in ,Their bodies were burned and charred remains buried at a site still marked by a circle of cobbled stones.Not very funny. They’d been found guilty of putting a spell on -year-old Christian Shaw, the daughter of a wealthy local laird - to this day, there’s more interest in whether the attention-seeking child really was to blame. A minor historical detail still over-shadows the horror of seven unjust deaths  Why Is it not possible for modern Scots to empathise – to think about the horror of the situation  Seven people, facing horrible deaths over entirely groundless accusations - can we not imagine the terror  Now to be fair, the Paisley event seems to have been a joyful festival with a Mardi Gras atmosphere, acrobats, hundreds of youngsters in brightly coloured costumes and mercully few witches’ hats or broomsticks. But that flippant and facile connection between strangulation and fun, in every radio interview and press article means I, for one, have no urge to attend. Mention of witches still prompts a wee titter and immediate association with Harry Potter, broomsticks and crooked noses. Not the  people accused of witchcraft in Scotland between  and . According to historians Lauren Martin and Joyce Miller in their exhaustive study ‘The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft’  per cent of them were executed,  per cent were women and almost all were tortured. Of course, that’s disputed. Women were not generally placed in the “boots,” “rack” or thumbscrews. Edinburgh woman Agnes Sampson was shackled to her cell wall and stabbed in the face with a four-pronged iron fork, which pierced through her cheeks and tongue – after being accused of plotting to kill King James VI in . But most suspected witches were “only” stripped naked and shaved of all hair including pubic hair to look for “devil’s marks” which were pricked with pins to find insensitive skin “proving” guilt. The idea of being touched, prodded and intimately examined by strange men must have been terrying. The women were then kept awake for days and “encouraged” to confess. A similar witch trial took place at Tullibole Castle near the Crook of Devon in Kinross, home to William Halliday and his son John in . They held court over ‘covens’ in the village and ordered  suspected witches to be strangled and burned. Rosie Hopkins lives near the old execution site and has researched the trials. She says “The women and one man were kept in solitary and in the dark. There is no record of any defence or appeals. That’s how disenfranchised these women were. When they were strangled, every villager was required to watch. The humiliation and terror is still alive and meaningful to me.”Quite. I’m sure I’m not the only mouthy woman looking at these trials thinking, there but for the passage of time, go I. Or, to use a more modern idiom - “Me Too.”It’s important to tease out links between modern women and “witches” of yesteryear because the idea that most were old, poor, disabled or odd is just plain wrong. The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft found  per cent of accused women came from “middle range” homes. Few were lonely spinsters or widows –  per cent were actually married - but almost all were confident, outspoken and assertive. This is what caused offence. As historian Louise Yeoman puts it“The average witch lived in a small borough town. She had an occupation and brought money into the home in her own right. She had a sharp tongue and might have fallen out with neighbours – in other words, she was us.”This matters.Despite its relatively small population, Scotland was Europe’s biggest persecutor of witches. King James VI’s personal obsession meant Scottish “witch-finders” were also sent abroad. They burned and killed hundreds of Sami men and women in Arctic Norway – a memorial to those victims was unveiled in  by Norway’s Queen Sonja. But there’s been no similar recognition or rehabilitation here. A site at the entrance to Edinburgh Castle’s esplanade, commemorates the place where Agnes Sampson and three hundred other women were strangled and burned for being witches in .A plaque beside a fountain reads “The wicked head and serene head signy that someused their exceptional knowledge for evil while others... wished their kind nothing but good.”This of course is nonsense. Scottish society stopped believing in the powers of witchcraft  years ago, so no “wicked head” passing within inches of this plaque during its last terried minutes on this earth could possibly have committed harm by thought or speech alone. Yet the plaque remains.Ten years ago, a campaign to pardon Scotland’s “witches” was rejected by Holyrood’s petitions committee because they felt it was wrong to excuse people found guilty under laws of their own time and “dficult to apply modern concepts of knowledge and morality to centuries past”.Really  Earlier this year, thousands of gay and bisexual men prosecuted for having sex under old laws, were quite rightly pardoned by a unanimous vote in the Scottish Parliament. The slur on the reputation of the women slaughtered centuries back is essentially no dferent. As it is, the refusal to recognise witchcraft as the unjust persecution ofwomen means new generations of well-meaning folk are able to ignore the pain, terror and persecution of witch trials and find the quasi-judicial lynching of outspoken women somehow inspiring. But why should the organisers of Paisley’s Halloween Festival recognise this shameful aspect of our history when officialdom in Scotland hardly cares Perhaps next year, Paisley can lead Scotland in respectful commemoration of its persecuted women and ensure that forgotten acts of misogyny don’t get packaged into selling opportunities for black hats, broomsticks and detachable warts at Halloween.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4821101.1540807788!/image/image.jpg","title":"no deal brexit an absolute nightmare for the economy","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...SNP deputy Westminster leader Kirsty Blackman has warned against an #absolute nightmare# no-deal Brexit scenario ahead of the Budget today.Mrs Blackman accused the Conservative government of being “far too focused on negotiating with itself”, arguing businesses were lacking certainty and trust in the Prime Minister’s capability to strike a deal with five months until the UK is due to leave the EU.Mrs Blackman, also the party’s spokeswoman on the economy, said: “Businesses are implementing their plan B, some of them are onto implementing their plan C … we are so close to Brexit day and nobody has any certainty.”She added: “People are not happy about the state of the negotiations, they are not happy particularly about the lack of certainty that there is and I don’t think there is any trust in Theresa May’s abilities to get this done.”A no-deal Brexit, she cautioned, would cut incomes, affect economic growth and result in “huge” job losses.She said: “A no-deal scenario is an absolute nightmare scenario, I can’t think of a country in history that has brought such foreseeable ­economic harm on itself.

Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Monday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8685096.1540801538!/image/image.jpg","title":"super savings on discount day","story":"Forget Halloween and Christmas, there#s only date that needs to be in your diary this year and it#s the biggest and best shopping day in Ballymena.

Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels. They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain. “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.“A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.6368375.1413823035!/image/3568985441.jpg","title":"new banbridge tesco extra store opens at the outlet","story":"The new Tesco Extra store at Bridgewater Park, Banbridge, has opened bringing  new jobs to the area and potentially boosting cross-border trade.Tesco unveiled its th store in Northern Ireland last Thursday.

We will have state of the art facilities, this will be a top rate training facility for local clubs and schools. Our kids deserve this. There will be high-tech lighting that will illuminate the pitch but won’t effect the houses near by.“It’s vital that local kids get full use of this facility, we want it filled to capacity every day with schools, we envisage coaches training kids here, Gaelic clubs, soccer clubs, after-schools activities and outdoor gym classes. I believe this will transform the community.”Work is due to begin in December andall goes according to plan it should be completed by the end of March.Cllr Baker said the investment by Belfast City Council is a big boost for the community. “This area suffered badly under Lisburn Council and we are delighted now that this huge investment has come into the area. We have a population of just under , people here and they deserve nothing but first class facilities and that’s what we are delivering.“As a father and a member of the community here I would love nothing better than on a Sunday morning having a blitz here, rather than going to other parts of Belfast. I’m very excited about the future.”Sinn Féin MLA Órlaithí Flynn added: “I welcome the investment coming into the Lagmore area and commend the great work that has been done by our local Councillor in securing improvements to the White Rise pitch. The youth in this area and the wider Lagmore community will reap the benefits of important enhancements such as this.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/stevie.png","title":"new cemetery needed for belfast","story":"AN all-party Cemeteries and Crematorium Development working group that was formed a year ago to tackle the ongoing issues around burial costs and cemetery maintenance and development, say they feel that Belfast graveyards and cemeteries need a radical overhaul to keep up with demand.The Council group, who meet on a monthly basis have been tasked with finding solutions and coming up with ideas for Belfast’s cemeteries.Councillor Stevie Corr is the Sinn Féin representative on the working group.“The idea of a new cemetery for West and North Belfast has been discussed for well over a decade now and has yet to come into fruition,” he said.“The City Cemetery for all intents and purposes is full, Milltown has limited availability as well, St Joseph’s cemetery in Hannahstown is only available to parishioners. New graves are only available in Blaris cemetery when someone dies, the days of pre-planning your funeral or purchasing multiple graves are gone, we are almost at crisis point with our cemeteries.”Last year Lisburn and Castlereagh Council was tendered for a new cemetery, however the tender was unsuccessful.Cllr Corr said: “Because of boundary changes people in the Colin area are no longer Lisburn Council meaning they will have to pay more to be buried in Blaris because that cemetery  crematorium is no longer in their jurisdiction.“This is reaching crisis point, we need to have a radical approach, review and rethink around the issue of burials, cremations and cemetery spaces. We can’t wait until the day somebody is refused burial because there is no space.”With that in mind Belfast City Council have come up with the new cemeteries working group to look at these issues and to also come up with ideas around the development of our cemeteries.Cllr Corr said: “I am the party representative on the group and we are coming up with some excellent plans. For example, a new multi-million pound upgrade will be going into Roselawn crematorium.“We still need a new cemetery for North and West Belfast, it’s a very sensitive subject.“Our cemeteries are also in a position where they can become historical and tourist attractions. Look at Tom Hartley’s cemetery tours, they tell the tale of our city, from rich tombs and headstones to poor grounds where thousands of our poor are buried.“Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin is one of the main tourist attractions on the island of Ireland, it went from being a crime hotspot to being a place of beauty and interest, because it tells the tale of the formative years around the formation of the Irish Free State – our cemeteries are no dferent.“There have been books written about the City Cemetery and Milltown Cemetery.”Cllr Corr continued: “Clton Street Graveyard contains the graves of some historically signicant families, including the Dunvilles, the Sinclairs and Henry Joy McCracken, one of the leading United Irishmen. It was closed to public access approximately  years ago due to anti-social behavior. This has now decreased and the local area of Henry Place has been re-generated and a new business hub has been formed. The graveyard remains locked due to concern regarding the safety of some of the monuments. There are currently regular requests for access from tourists and visitors with a genealogical or historical interest in the graveyard.“Our social, political, economic and religious history are in our cemeteries and we need to have them as places we can use for education.“Take for example the City Cemetery heritage project, we want to bring tourists, academics and school children in as well as the local community.Our cemeteries are at their safest when people are in them, Tom Hartley’s tours have proved that.“The purpose of this working group is to give an extra edge and focus while giving the issues of graves, cemeteries and monuments the attention they deserve.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newington boss crossan demands swift improvement","story":"Steel and Sons Cup quarter-finalSt James’ Swts vNewington Donegal Celtic ParkNEWINGTON manager, Conor Crossan has demanded an improved showing from his side as they continue the defence of their Steel and Sons Cup title with a quarter-final away trip to St James’ Swts on Saturday. The North Belfast side suffered a - home defeat to Lurgan Celtic earlier this month as they lost ground to Championship  league leaders Annagh United. Last Saturday, they bowed out of the Intermediate Cup following a - penalty shoot-out defeat at Maiden City after the game finished - after  minutes. Crossan feels Saturday’s game is the perfect opportunity for his side to rediscover their form in a competition that is close to their hearts. “We are looking forward to Saturday, hopefully we can get back to winning ways,” said Crossan.“The boys know that the performances haven’t been good enough over the last couple of weeks. “We want to stay in as many cup competitions as we can because of the way the league is structured. “It was a poor result and a poor performance against Lurgan Celtic and we had a few players out last Saturday, but it was sore getting beat on penalties.“You always want to be going into the big games on the back of a win and our form of the last two weeks hasn’t been good. “We are going into this match against a team that has won  from  so they’ll be full of confidence. It will be up to me to get the team up for this game.” As defending champions, Newington will be the favourites to progress, especially considering they play in a higher league. Yet, the progress made by St James’ Swts hasn’t gone unnoticed in the north of the city and Crossan is refusing to underestimate the challenge posed by the Swts at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday. “People might underestimate the Ballymena League, but you have some great teams in that league – the likes of Bangor and Coagh and teams who were in Championship  in recent years,” added the Newington boss. “They are playing at a good level and they have players who have experience of playing in the Irish League. “They’ll be full of confidence and I don’t think they lost too much sleep when they drew us.“They are the type of team who relish the challenge no matter who they face. “They’ve been making noise for a while now.“They will want to build on that start and keep going, but hopefully we can put a stop to that winning run on Saturday.” St James’ Swts assistant manager Dan Murphy, meanwhile, insists the club is “buzzing” ahead of Saturday’s eagerly-anticipated clash with the defending Steel and Sons Cup champions. The West Belfast side have made an incredible start to the   season and have won all  of their game so far. The only stain on an otherwise perfect start came when they lost the points following their - win over last year’s Ballymena and Provincial League winners Glebe after it emerged one of their players should have been serving a suspension arising from a ban with his previous club. St James’ are aiming to go a step further than they managed in last season’s competition when they bowed out after losing - to Linfield Swts in the last eight.  “The whole club is buzzing, we know how big this competition is. We got to this stage last year and we lost out to Linfield Swts,” said Murphy. “We were - down and we gave a penalty away and went - down. “We got a goal back and we threw everything at them to get an equaliser and we make a silly mistakes and they broke and made it -. “It was a bit gut-wrenching. We wanted to go on further in the competition and we are just hoping to go one step further this year and make it into the semi-finals.” Last season, the Swts challenged for promotion from the Ballymena and Provincial League Premier Division, but fell short at the end of a busy campaign. This season, they are, strictly speaking, unbeaten on the pitch and Murphy feels that is in no small part because of the summer signings made by manager Damien McStravick. “Last year, we knew we had a good team and we were playing good football,” said Murphy. “Towards the end of the season, it was just injuries and suspensions that killed us.“Our squad was a bit light and a few boys had to play with knocks. “During the summer, we made some brilliant signings thanks to Damien McStravick. He met boys who had played at a higher level and sold them on the ethos of the club. “We ended up with a smashing squad. “We kept all the players we had last year and we’ve added a bit more quality to it. “The new boys have all bought into what the club is about and they are enjoying their football.” This Saturday, St James’ bid to continue their incredible start to the season by dumping the holders out of the Steel and Sons Cup. However, Murphy is expecting a tough battle from the North Belfast side given that Newington went on to defeat Linfield Swts in last year’s Christmas Day final at Seaview. “They are a very dogged team and they work hard for each other. They are able to take their chances when they get them,” added the St James’ Swts assistant. “We also know they are the champions of this competition and they’re no going to let go of it easily. “We played them in pre-season and we won that game -, but they signed well after that game. “We know we are going to be up against it and it will be a real test. “We have to be at our best, but the way we are playing, I thinkwe show up on the day, we can win the game.” Newington will be without the suspended duo of Gavin Taggart and Kevin Bradley for Saturday’s clash while St James’ Swts are set to be at full strength for the quarter-final tie."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sf%e2%80%88asked to take","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw has called for the removal of the election-style anti-Brexit posters erected by Sinn Féin in parts of the constituency.

As he was going off, McDonnell reacted to taunts and a plastic water bottle was thrown towards him.This led to punches thrown with several Newington players following him off the pitch as scuffles ensued. Things appeared to have calmed down with the players ing to the field, but the incident then sparked off again as McDonnell was being led to the dressing rooms. Again, players left the pitch, some it seemed were trying to calm the situation rather than join in, but the referee had seen enough, saying afterwards the chaotic scenes were out of control and he had no choice but to abandon the game.What happens now is up to the Co. Antrim FA. The draw for the semi-finals were made on Saturday with East Belfast awaiting the winner of Saturday’s gamethat is to be replayed or not.The Co. Antrim secretary was unavailable for comment this morning, but a decision is expected in the coming days.Click here to watch short Facebook video of the St James Swts v Newington game at https:www.facebook AndytownNews videos  "},{"url":null,"title":"chinabuilt titanic ii to set sail in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China. However it will remain docked and not take on sailings.

As a result of this review, which included getting further legal opinion, NI Water now accepts that its interpretation of Article  was too broad and that it therefore had sought to ban certain activities that were not envisaged under the legislation, as currently drafted.\"Because the Assembly is still suspended due to the political stalemate, the legislative processes which are required to bring Northern Ireland into line with Britains practice in regard to hosepipe bans have not happened.Westminster could legislate in the absence of a ing Stormont.But given the pressure of Brexit on business, it is unlikely that Parliament will choose to do so in the near future."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic updates halloween road closure and shuttle services as thousands expected for festivities","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

City deal packages bundle together additional funding and decision making powers aimed at driving growth in regions of the UK. The Chancellor made the first solid commitment to a city deal for Belfast in last years Budget, announcing negotiations on the deal were set to take place. Belfast City Council announced it has submitted a \"detailed, ambitious proposition\" and aims at securing £bn in investment from a number of sources. Mondays Budget will reveal whether Philip Hammond has agreed to stump up the £m being asked for as part of the deal. Chancellor Phillip Hammond is expected to make an announcement about Belfasts city deal on Monday If successful, it is projected the deal could deliver , jobs through a -year investment strategy, and through the £bn worth of public funding could leverage a further £bn of investment from the private sector. Where  has city deals  City deals were launched back in  with the aim of handing over more power to drive economic growth to cities across the UK.The first wave of the project saw deals for the eight largest cities outside of London, with this then being expanded to include the six cities with the highest population growth over the  years between  and . Originally confined to England, included among the aims of the deals were to allow the cities to \"take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area\" and to \"do what they think is best to help businesses grow\". After its initial roll-out, city deals were expanded out into the regions, and as of July last year there were  city deals in England, four in Scotland, and one in Wales. Is the deal exclusively for Belfast  If approved, the Belfast City Region Deal encompass five local authorities in the east of the province alongside Belfast City Council, as well as a number of educational institutions. Also included in the deal are Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, Ards and North Down Borough Council, Belfast City Council, Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council, Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council. Queens University, Ulster University, Belfast politan College and other further education colleges are also included in the deal.  Belfast tables £bn ‘city deal’ proposal ahead of Chancellor’s BudgetThe envisaged deal, which has now been submitted to Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley, focuses on four key investment pillars – digital and innovation infrastructure tourism-led regeneration and skills and employability.Some of the measures included in the proposal are: the creation of a Global Innovation Institute the creation of further centres of innovation investment in digital connectivity investment in new tourist attractions and the extension of Belfasts Rapid Transport System. What about the city deal for Derry  At the time of the last Budget in , Philip Hammond was criticised by politicians from the north west for failing to mention a possible city deal for Derry, with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood labelling the omission a \"disgrace\". \"For too long Derry and the North West has been treated like the poor relation. Like second class citizens and we arent taking it,\" said Mr Eastwood at the time. In July, Chancellor Philip Hammond made the strongest commitment to date for a city deal for Northern Irelands second largest city. Mr Hammond said he was seeking to support productivity growth in Northern Ireland by inviting a \"a bid for a Derry-Londonderry city deal, an opportunity for the region to continue to drive forward economic growth and build an economy that works for everyone\".The document outlining the proposal for the city deal was submitted last month, with a delegation from Derry and Strabane District Council travelling to London. At a meeting of the council last week the Councils Chief Executive John Kelpie said signicant progress had already been made. The Derry Journal reports Mr Kelpie saying the Council would continue to \"lobby the Treasury and the relevant government departments to give a firm commitment\" and that formal negotiations could begin following an announcement in Mondays budget.Writing in the Derry Journal on Friday, Sinn Fein MP for Foyle Elisha McCallion said it would a \"major step forward\"a city deal was announced as part of the Budget.

There is no single obvious successor, but several potential contenders.The current parliamentary term is due to expire in , and the dpa news agency reported that Mrs Merkel said she will not seek re-election.She currently governs Germany in a “grand coalition” of what traditionally have been the country’s biggest parties – the CDU, Baia’s conservative Christian Social Union, and the centre-left Social Democrats. Her fourth-term government only took office in March, but has become notorious for squabbling.An election in the central state of Hesse saw both the CDU and the Social Democrats lose signicant ground amid gains for both the Green party and the far-right Alternative for Germany party. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen and health minister Jens Spahn, arrive for a CDU party’s leaders meeting in Berlin Mrs Merkel’s party managed an unimpressive win, narrowly salvaging a majority for its regional governing coalition with the Greens in Hesse.The debacle followed a battering in a state election in Baia two weeks ago for the CSU and the Social Democrats.Citing unidentied party sources, the dpa reported that Mrs Merkel told an ongoing CDU leadership meeting that she is prepared to step down as party leader but intends to remain chancellor. The mass-circulation daily Bild also reported that she said she will not run again as party leader.That is a major concession for Mrs Merkel, who for years has insisted that the chancellor should also be party leader. However, there is precedent for splitting the two jobs.Mrs Merkel’s predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, stepped down as leader of his centre-left Social Democrats in  as his government struggled, but remained chancellor until he narrowly lost an election  months later. Helmut Schmidt, West Germany’s chancellor from  to , never led the Social Democrats.“The CDU faces a turning point,” Mike Mohring, a regional party leader from eastern Germany, told Welt television. “Angela Merkel knows best what to do, and now she has decided. And that demands respect.”He said that it is important to avoid “long personnel debates” and restore people’s confidence in the CDU as a governing party.Mrs Merkel dragged the CDU to the political centre in her years as leader, dropping military conscription, introducing benefits encouraging fathers to look after their young children and abruptly accelerating the shutdown of Germany’s nuclear power plants following Japan’s Fukushima disaster in .She allowed large numbers of asylum-seekers into Germany in , many fleeing the fighting in Syria, declaring that “we will manage it”, before gradually pivoting to a more restrictive approach. That decision has led to lasting tensions in her conservative Union bloc, particularly with the CDU’s Baia-only sister party, the CSU, and helped the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party gain support.The Social Democrats’ leader, Andrea Nahles, demanded a “clear, binding timetable” for implementing government projects before the federal coalition faces an already-agreed upon mid-term review next autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"brandnew passenger jet plunges into sea with nearly 200 people","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A much depleted committee of ten members was elected.Over  letters will be circulated to local people appealing to their sense of community commitment.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

Others decided to duck the challenges and retreat to the Opposition benches. That is a matter for them. We are getting on with the work. It#s not always easy or straightforward. This is what delivery looks like. No gimmicks. No grandstanding. Just Ministers getting on with the work.#It sounded very positive. It was meant to. It was a direct riposte tothose who had dared to suggest that the working relationship between the DUP and Sinn Fein was ‘built on the pretence that all was well between them’.    The RHI Inquiry report is unlikely to do Arlene Foster or the DUP any favours Yet, just  days later – January ,  – the pretence of the good relationship and the pretence behind the joint article was blown apart by Martin McGuinness’s resignation letter: ‘At times I have stretched and challenged republicans and nationalists in my determination to reach out to our unionist neighbours. It is a source of deep personal frustration that those efforts have not always been reciprocated by unionist leaders. At times, they have been met with outright rejection. The equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP. ‘Apart from the negative attitude to nationalism and to the Irish identity and culture, there has been a shameful disrespect towards many other sections of our community. Women, the LGBT community and ethnic minorities have all felt this prejudice. And for those who wish to live their lives through the medium of Irish, elements in the DUP have exhibited the most crude and crass bigotry ... I am tendering my resignation ... In the available period Sinn Fein will not nominate to the position of deputy first minister. We now need an election to allow the people to make their own judgment on these issues democratically at the ballot box.’Irrespective of what has emerged during the inquiry and irrespective of the findings and recommendations of the final report, one fact is certain: RHI brought down the government of Northern Ireland. Within a couple of weeks of the story breaking it became clear that Sinn Fein was angling for an election: that’s why McGuinness’s letter led with republicans ‘stretching’ themselves for peace, and accused the DUP of pursuing a ‘negative attitude to nationalism.’ He chose, as one of his last political acts, to press the nuclear button: an extraordinary thing to do for someone who had put so much personal investment into the entire process. It’s worth bearing in mind, too, that Sinn Fein hasn’t emerged from the inquiry with clean hands. Having boasted about ‘getting on with the work’ and ‘delivery,’ it does seem odd that they didn’t appear to know all that much about how the RHI scheme was actually being delivered and whether the costings etc had been properly assessed and understood. Perhapsthey had insisted on proper collective responsibility and accountability before signing off on Executive formation with the DUP in ,  and , it might have prevented calamity on this scale.For the DUP, of course, RHI has been a nightmare: and they will be very worried about the report. That’s why a deal to reboot the Executive won’t be struck before the publication of that report unless, that is, Foster is ‘encouraged’ to step down as leader in the meantime. It will not be possible for her to take the role of first minister while the shadow of the report hangs over her head. Only the softest, most benign of reports, could save her political skin at this point and the evidence we have heard during the sitting of the inquirysuggests that the report won’t do her or the DUP any favours.I’m aware that there are people across the DUP who have been wondering how to handle the ‘Arlene problem.’ She knows it, too. But here’s the thing: last February’s potential dealfoundered on the Irish language. I have heard nothing since then to convince me that there has been a change of thinking within the DUP on that issue: andthere hasn’t been a change, then what does a new leader bring to the table  That’s not to say that something isn’t possible but it would require massive compromises from both sides and I’m not sure what those would be. Compromise risks vote loss and it would be a very brave successor to Foster who would begin his leadership with that kind of compromise.She’s in an awful position: with very little to do now but wait for the findings of the RHI report –knowing that it could be catastrophic for the DUP. And her position isn’t helped by the fact that she and her MPs are having to issue regular warnings to Theresa May about anything which could undermine the Union as the UK leaves the EU. Legacy scandal: ‘The principle thou shalt not upset the terrorists dictates our approach to the past,’ says Austin Stack Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"On November  she also has to address the DUP’s annual conference. That will be a dficult speech. She knows it. The party know it. Probably the most dficult speech a DUP leader has had to make since the decision was taken to cut a power-sharing deal with Sinn Fein in .A final personal reflection. Having watched and written about all of this for the past  years – and I was based at the Assembly for some of that time – it would take an awful lot to convince me that we should trust anyone hereto deliver good, effective, responsible, collective, accountable, thought-through government.try catch     .               ..

Leave the mash to cool before stirring in the egg, coriander and green chilli. Generously season with salt and pepper. Set aside.. While the potatoes are cooking, whizz the salmon, ginger and lime zest in a food processor until they form a thick paste.. Peel the outer layer of the lemongrass and discard. Cut the stem in half ways and chop as finely as you are able. Add to the salmon paste, then add the salmon mixture to the cooled potato, combining well. Divide the mixture into eight and shape into patties.. Dip each one into the breadcrumbs to coat and put onto a large plate or baking tray. Chill in the fridge for at least an hour to firm up the fishcakes.. Place a large, heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Heat the sesame oil and butter together in the pan until beginning to foam, then fry the fish cakes in batches, until golden on both sides.. To make the dipping sauce, combine all the ingredients and pour into a small serving dish.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

and the chaotic roll-out of Universal Credit, has had a devastating impact on families across Scotland.ldquoWe expect to spend over pound million in - on welfare mitigation and measures to help protect those on low incomes ndash over pound million more than in the previous year.Scottish Labourrsquos Education spokesman Iain Gray MSP said:ldquoWealth should not be a barrier to education and that is why this research is particularly troubling.ldquoSchool unorms and trips can be costly and it is important that grants are regularly reviewed to ensure they are sufficient.ldquoBut it is also clear that much more needs to be done to tackle the root causes of poverty.ldquoLabour would use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to top-up child benefit by pound per week, and stop the cuts to local services to build a society that works for the many not the few.The Scottish Greensrsquo education spokesperson, Ross Greer MSP said: ldquoThis valuable report is unfortunately of no surprise to those working in Scottish education.ldquoMuch of it confirms the conclusions in the report that Greens delivered to the Scottish Government, outlining how in some instances parents are being forced to choose between feeding their children and buying them the clothing and equipment required for their education..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Hidden education costs impacting on poorest families  u report article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In factyou’d said to me  days ago there would be tourists in Portadown town centre I’d still have laughed.   The ghostly figure to the left of News Letter reporter Graeme Cousins However, last week I was one of nearly  tourists walking the streets of the Co Armagh town as part of a ghost tour organised by Portadown Heritage Tours, a branch of the local Orange Order.And it was to be a ghost tour with a rather appropriate ending ... when a ghostly apparition joined the touring party for a final snap.As the tour came to an end our guide Lisa Partridge gathered us together for a group photo close to the site of the  massacre at the Bann bridge. She remarked that it was the site in Portadown where a ghost sighting was most likely.She took the snap and I thought nothing more of it until Lisa shared the photo the next day.   An artists impression of the  massacre As I scanned the image my eyes were drawn to a figure just behind me in the image that hadn’t been there when the photo was being taken.In the space between the two ladies positioned fth and sixth from the right, what looks to be a lady in profile view, with her hair pulled back, can be seen lurking in the background.I don’t believe in ghosts and my explanation would be that it’s a coincidental arrangement of leaves at the fence behind us, but all the same it did send a few chills up my spine the first time I saw it.Others in the office agreed that it did look a lot like a human form, and was certainly a lot sharper than some of the blurred images often attached to ghost stories.   St Marks Church in Portadownthe spot where the last man was hanged in the town Lisa said: “It wouldn’t be the first time a ghost has shown up in a picture taken in that area.“We took a picture last year under the bridge down at the Bann river and we picked out what looked like the outline of a mother holding the hand of her child.“It fits in with the  rebellion stories and the massacre that took place at the bridge here.Road closed after serious collision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“We tell people that this area is where they’re most likely to get a sighting.”   Tour guides Ashleigh Todd and Lisa Partridge The -year-old explained how she got involved in historical tours of Portadown: “I’ve always had an interest in history, but was a bit wary of finding work after a history degree, so I did business studies instead.“I came to the heritage tours from a retail background. The idea of heritage tours is we want to move the Orange Order forward.”Portadown Heritage Tours was set up with the help of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund.Lisa, a member of WLOL No  in Edenderry, said: “It’s about community tourism. It’s local people telling local stories about places people walk past every day but don’t realise the signicance of them.“Our normal three tours are a town tour, a Drumcree tour and then the tours ofhall.“Through the history we were gathering from the other tours, ghost stories started appearing. The majority surrounded the  massacre at the Bann bridge during the  rebellion.“For that there was actual documentation from witnesses about the apparitions.“When you start looking for something it’s everywhere. People started coming forward with ghost stories.“We ran a ghost tour last year as a pilot and it keeps growing.“We’ve started getting into more of the stories this year.“Anyone can claim they’ve seen a ghost, so we try to seethere’s an historical event that can be linked to the sighting orthere’s been any documentation of sightings in that area, in newspapers or from other sources.”She added: “Whenever I go on holidays I always try to do a ghost tour. You get dferent ones where people get into character, but for this tour I just wanted to strip it all back and focus on the stories. “There won’t be people jumping out at you or we won’t be embellishing the stories to make them more scary.“It’s suitable for all ages, though there’s some walking involved to get to the locations around the town.”The -stop tour begins at Carleton Street Orange Hall and finishes at the site of the  massacre at the River Bann. Askedshe had ever seen a ghost herself, Lisa said: “There’s one in Carleton Street Orange Hall. I haven’t seen it personally but I’ve heard it.“It’s the ghost of William John Locke . There’s times it’s just been me and another girl in the office and % we’ve heard footsteps going up and down the stairs.“There’s times you feel like someone is watching you.“That said, I wouldn’t say it’s a scary place to work.”Askedthere had been any objections within the local order to running a ghost tour, she said: “Everyone involved with the heritage tours are members of the loyal order. “Our ethos was that the Orange Order needs to move forward, and put out the hand of friendship.“To do this we’ve opened up the doors of the hall and invited people in to come and see. It’s not an Orange museum but it’s living history.“There’s been no objection from the Orange Order to the ghost tours, in fact some of them link back to the Orange Order. As well as Locke, the last man hanged in Portadown was an Orangeman. The  rebellion also has big links to the Protestant culture, there are memorials at the site.“While there are Orange links this tour is very much cross community. The people who are coming have been   from both sides of the community.“We’ve had a lot of people coming from the west – Tyrone, Dungannon.“We don’t have a set cost yet, we just ask for donation only. Things are still at an early stage and we want to add more stories as well.”Portadown Heritage Tours which is attached to the Orange Order have been running tours of the town for the past  months.They began running tours of Carleton Street Orange Hall as well as tours of the town and Drumcree. The ghost tour came about as a result of information uncovered on their other tours.The final ghost tour of the month takes place on Tuesday at pm from Carleton Street Orange Hall.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £.

Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %.
