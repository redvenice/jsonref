Top high street stores plan to ditch Black...Share this articleWhat you need to know each week: Listen to the This is Money podcastThe UK Gift Card \u0026amp Voucher Association believes that anyone buying a gift card should include the receipt as part of the present. It will show the recipient how long they have got to spend the voucher while the receipt may also be used to claim money back or get a voucher replacement if a card is lost.Max Daniels, of the trade organisation, says: ‘Customers can be confused by the terms and conditions, so check online before making a purchase and let your recipient know about them.’Retailers John Lewis, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Waterstones and WH Smith offer vouchers that last 24 months. But if the balance on the card is checked during this period, the time-expiry clock automatically resets back to two years. Others are even less generous. Ticketmaster vouchers expire after a year. Gift cards for small shops and regional beauty boutiques may last for only half this time. For example, The Boutique Wellness Spa in Cambridge and the Orchid Beauty Spa in Birmingham both sell vouchers valid for only six months.          Expiry: Retailers John Lewis, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Waterstones and WH Smith offer vouchers that last 24 monthsWith an Amazon gift card, the time limit is a comparatively generous ten years. Apple Store and iTunes cards do not have expiry dates but the ‘content codes’ printed on them may need to be updated if the cards are not used straightaway. National Book Tokens do not expire for eight years though those purchased before October 2015 automatically expired after two years if not used. But the provider will replace out-of-date vouchers upon request.Theatre Tokens, which can be used for shows at more than 240 venues nationwide, come with no strings attached. If a gift card is lost without a receipt, then usually the balance on it is also lost.          Also, when a retailer gets into financial difficulties, a gift card can often become worthless or extra conditions imposed on its usage.For example, when British Home Stores went into administration a couple of years ago, anyone who had one of its gift cards could only use it if the card amount was at least matched by non-voucher spending.For example, a voucher worth £20 could only be used to buy something costing at least £40.Other shops that have gone bust in recent years, including HMV and Jessops, left those with gift cards stranded with a worthless piece of paper or plastic. Limited protection is provided by Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act which protects buyers of gift cards for £100 or more, provided the purchase was made by a credit card. Vouchers worth less than £100 are not covered.Another downside of a gift card is that it is restrictive. Unwanted cards can be put up for sale on websites such as Zeek.me. Sellers must accept a sum less than a card’s face value while Zeek takes a seven per cent commission cut. \u0026#xA318.99 per month for 10Mbps \u0026#xA3150 Expedia vouchers or free tech"},{"url":null,"title":"Oxford University college votes against flying Union Flag Queens birthday","story":"An Oxford college has voted against flying the Union Flag on the Queen\u0027s birthday because it is a \u0027symbol of colonialism\u0027According to the JCR minutes, one objector said: \u0027The Union Jack is not a unifying flag as many soldiers were forced to go into the war and it is also a symbol of colonialism.\u0027Ex Foreign Secretary rouses the DUP in Belfast with a...Theresa May gives in to demands that Gibraltar should be...Share this articleA second added that \u0027St George\u0027s flag has been taken to be a symbol of the far-Right\u0027 and that it was also associated \u0027with violence against non-white people\u0027.Concern was also raised over the risk of students from Northern Ireland being offended.

Ticketmaster vouchers expire after a year. Gift cards for small shops and regional beauty boutiques may last for only half this time. For example, The Boutique Wellness Spa in Cambridge and the Orchid Beauty Spa in Birmingham both sell vouchers valid for only six months.          Expiry: Retailers John Lewis, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Waterstones and WH Smith offer vouchers that last 24 monthsWith an Amazon gift card, the time limit is a comparatively generous ten years. Apple Store and iTunes cards do not have expiry dates but the ‘content codes’ printed on them may need to be updated if the cards are not used straightaway. National Book Tokens do not expire for eight years though those purchased before October 2015 automatically expired after two years if not used. But the provider will replace out-of-date vouchers upon request.Theatre Tokens, which can be used for shows at more than 240 venues nationwide, come with no strings attached. If a gift card is lost without a receipt, then usually the balance on it is also lost.          Also, when a retailer gets into financial difficulties, a gift card can often become worthless or extra conditions imposed on its usage.For example, when British Home Stores went into administration a couple of years ago, anyone who had one of its gift cards could only use it if the card amount was at least matched by non-voucher spending.For example, a voucher worth £20 could only be used to buy something costing at least £40.Other shops that have gone bust in recent years, including HMV and Jessops, left those with gift cards stranded with a worthless piece of paper or plastic. Limited protection is provided by Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act which protects buyers of gift cards for £100 or more, provided the purchase was made by a credit card. Vouchers worth less than £100 are not covered.Another downside of a gift card is that it is restrictive. Unwanted cards can be put up for sale on websites such as Zeek.me. Sellers must accept a sum less than a card’s face value while Zeek takes a seven per cent commission cut. \u0026#xA318.99 per month for 10Mbps \u0026#xA3150 Expedia vouchers or free tech"},{"url":null,"title":"Steampunks descend sleepy Yorkshire town","story":"    Locals could not resist taking a second glance at this steampunk in a black and blue dress with a Guy Fawkes mask          Steampunks were pictured next to a steam locomotive train today as they made their way to the village of HaworthLocals seemed a tad bemused by the revellers descent on the village, situated in the Pennine hills of west Yorkshire. The event is now in its sixth year and has helped to raise money through a raffle to the Sue Ryder Manorlands Hospice nearby.  The three-day event runs from Friday 23 November to Sunday 25 November.           The revellers had gone to a tremendous effort with their clothes, which were inspired by items in the 19th century          Various modern utilitarian objects have been modded by inidual artisans into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical \u0027steampunk\u0027 style, and a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk          Steampunk couples were seen walking through the cobbled streets of Haworth, west Yorkshire. Steampunk began as a sub-genre of science fiction and fantasy literature, but has developed in recent years to become a craft and lifestyle movement that commonly features some aspect of steam-powered machinery          Black Friday sales?

Today, when she should be reunited with her five children, she is being hunted across Pakistan, forced to scuttle under cover of darkness from one safe house to another in fear of her life.It is a desperate situation – and one not helped by Britain which refuses to offer the mother-of-five sanctuary.Last month the Supreme Court in Pakistan decided that Asia, 52, who spent eight years on death row, had been falsely accused of blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammed. While most of the country erupted in fury at her release, nowhere did the anger burn more fiercely than in her home village of Ittan Wali, 40 miles south-east of Lahore, where her extraordinary ordeal began. Following news of her reprieve, women took to the streets to protest, a bus was torched and children ran riot.Until now, beyond a few sketchy details, little about Asia’s persecution has been forthcoming. But last week The Mail on Sunday travelled to Ittan Wali and interviewed key witnesses, spoke to Asia’s trusted friends and unearthed court documents. What emerged was a story far more shocking than previously imagined.          Since her release from prison, Mrs Bibi has faced constant death threats from angry mobsOur investigation can reveal that, on the day she was seized by villagers and accused of blasphemy:Asia’s forefathers have lived in Ittan Wali since before the formation of Pakistan in 1947. For decades, they have been the only Christians among 300 Muslim families.The village is wholly unremarkable – a collection of mud brick single-storey houses and dirt tracks skirted by open sewers – but it was home to Asia. And although she was frequently harassed and entreated to convert to Islam, she refused to budge.She lived with her husband, Ashiq Masih, and two stepdaughters, one stepson, and two daughters of her own in a single room mud brick house.Back in 2009, Asia’s husband was working as a labourer in a local brick kiln. But with four children to feed – the couple’s eldest daughter was married – Asia often worked as a farmhand to bring in extra money.At dawn on June 14, Asia and 25 other women went to work picking falsa berries, similar to blackcurrants, in a field owned by the village’s richest man Muhammad Idrees. She was paid 250 rupees (£1.50) a day.That morning was a Sunday, so her husband had no work. She left the house quietly, with Ashiq, now 62, and the four children fast asleep on the large bed they all shared.At midday, when the baking Punjab heat reached 110F (43C), Asia went to a nearby hand pump and returned with a bucket of water to share with her colleagues and a tin cup. Two sisters, Asma Bibi and Mafia Bibi (who aren’t related to Asia), turned on her, saying: ‘This cup was intended for Muslims, why did you take the water from it?’They said she had made the water impure, because she was ‘chura’, a derogatory term which means ‘low-caste’, used for Christians.The two sisters then urged Asia to convert to Islam, so she wouldn’t be chura any more – typical of the religious harassment she faced in Ittan Wali all her life.For once, instead of remaining meekly silent, Asia stood her ground. She said she would not convert, and asked why she, not her co-workers, should change religion.          Her trouble started when she drew water from this hand pump near Ittan Wali village It has been claimed that she disparaged the Prophet Mohammed during the heated discussion that followed. She emphatically denies this – and insists the allegations were invented to frame her.If so, it is a scenario familiar to many of the nearly three million Christians in Pakistan, out of a total population of 165 million. The blasphemy laws, it is widely acknowledged, have long been used against them, not as a system of organised persecution, but simply as a way of settling petty disputes.After the row, Asia ran back home crying and told Ashiq what had happened. He told her not to worry, and he seemed to be correct as there were no further incidents for the next five days.But on Friday, the Muslim religious day, Asia returned to work in the falsa fields, unaware that a mile away, the village imam, Qari Muhammad Salaam, was stirring up the villagers by announcing on the mosque loudspeakers that she had committed blasphemy.The first she was aware of any trouble was hearing a low rumble of voices, then the terrifying chant: ‘Kill the Christian!’She realised the men were coming for her and soon they appeared on a ridge. She had nowhere to run. In a panic, she stumbled, dizzy with fear, and a minute or so later felt hands roughly grab her arms and shoulders while another man fitted a leather noose around her neck.Hauled to her feet, she was paraded back to the village – led by the leather strap – and taken to a courtyard in the house of the village leader, where more than 100 people had gathered, including imams from neighbouring villages. It seemed that a makeshift sharia court was being convened.The village imam was flanked by the two sisters and Asia was flung at his feet. He told her: ‘You’ve made derogatory remarks about our Prophet. You know what happens to people who insult the Prophet. You can redeem yourself by accepting Islam.’Asia protested her innocence and said she did not want to convert. At this, the crowd became increasingly hostile and began jeering and spitting. Asia was then whipped with sticks and sandals. Then, in a form of ritual humiliation, someone smeared her face with black dye while others held her down.One of Asia’s daughters tried to intervene but was grabbed by her hair and her face smashed against a door. Another daughter, Isham, then nine, could only watch, terrified and powerless.          Mrs Bibi lived with her family in this house in Ittan Wali village in Pakistan\u0027s Punjab regionAt one point Asia begged for water but the crowd shouted: ‘No water for the Christian dog.’ Another voice added: ‘Drink urine!’Then little Isham ran off to look for water and summon her father, who was out working.By now Asia was badly bleeding and semi-conscious. But when her husband reached the village, he was held back by the mob. Fearing he would be killed, he ran away.Witnesses said it was clear that villagers would have killed Asia but for the intervention of a teacher who argued that she should be handed to police.Two officers arrived 45 minutes later and she was taken away and formally charged with blasphemy.Two days later, Joseph Francis, of the Centre for Legal Aid Assistance and Settlement, a Christian group in Lahore, went to Ittan Wali to investigate.Villagers told him that Asma and Mafia, previously friends of Asia, were told to argue with her as a way of forcing her to either flee her home or convert to Islam. When The Mail on Sunday visited Ittan Wali last week, we found her house was occupied by another family.And from the moment of our arrival, our every move was shadowed. It later emerged that villagers had been instructed to tip off police about any Western visitors.We headed to the imam’s house, next to the mosque. A group of men in their early twenties followed our reporters and stood close by, staring, as we waited for the imam to answer the door. Eventually, a middle-aged man, dressed in a blue shalwar kameez, appeared and walked us to the mosque.Instructed to sit down on a mat in a courtyard, whose marble floors were caked with dirt, we waited for the imam to appear.When he joined us he appeared friendly, offering tea and water, though his demeanour changed when Asia’s case was mentioned. He seemed angry at Asia’s reprieve and warned ominously: ‘Everybody is prepared to sacrifice their lives for the respect of the Holy Prophet.’After Asia was charged with blasphemy, she was transferred to jail in the town of Sheikhupura, about 27 miles away.In November 2010, she was sentenced to death by hanging in a 30-minute hearing at a court in the town, with no cross-examination of any witnesses. The court erupted with joy as she was sentenced.The decision was upheld by Lahore High Court in 2014. In her written testimony, Asia insisted that the sisters and the imam conspired in a ‘false, fabricated and fictitious case against me’.

She is now in hiding as she has received constant death threats since her release Until now, beyond a few sketchy details, little about Asia’s persecution has been forthcoming. But last week The Mail on Sunday travelled to Ittan Wali and interviewed key witnesses, spoke to Asia’s trusted friends and unearthed court documents. What emerged was a story far more shocking than previously imagined.Our investigation can reveal that, on the day she was seized by villagers and accused of blasphemy:Asia was paraded through her village with a leather noose around her neck A baying mob beat her with sticks during a ‘court’ hearing Villagers smeared her face with black ink to humiliate her She was promised her life would be spared only if she converted to Islam Her life was saved when a schoolteacher rescued her only minutes from death.Asia’s forefathers have lived in Ittan Wali since before the formation of Pakistan in 1947. For decades, they have been the only Christians among 300 Muslim families.The village is wholly unremarkable – a collection of mud brick single-storey houses and dirt tracks skirted by open sewers – but it was home to Asia. And although she was frequently harassed and entreated to convert to Islam, she refused to budge.RAF Typhoon pilot blew up FOUR Isis trucks that were more...Share this articleShe lived with her husband, Ashiq Masih, and two stepdaughters, one stepson, and two daughters of her own in a single room mud brick house.Back in 2009, Asia’s husband was working as a labourer in a local brick kiln. But with four children to feed – the couple’s eldest daughter was married – Asia often worked as a farmhand to bring in extra money.At dawn on June 14, Asia and 25 other women went to work picking falsa berries, similar to blackcurrants, in a field owned by the village’s richest man Muhammad Idrees. She was paid 250 rupees (£1.50) a day.          Since her release from prison, Mrs Bibi has faced constant death threats from angry mobsThat morning was a Sunday, so her husband had no work. She left the house quietly, with Ashiq, now 62, and the four children fast asleep on the large bed they all shared.At midday, when the baking Punjab heat reached 110F (43C), Asia went to a nearby hand pump and returned with a bucket of water to share with her colleagues and a tin cup. Two sisters, Asma Bibi and Mafia Bibi (who aren’t related to Asia), turned on her, saying: ‘This cup was intended for Muslims, why did you take the water from it?’They said she had made the water impure, because she was ‘chura’, a derogatory term which means ‘low-caste’, used for Christians.The two sisters then urged Asia to convert to Islam, so she wouldn’t be chura any more – typical of the religious harassment she faced in Ittan Wali all her life.For once, instead of remaining meekly silent, Asia stood her ground. She said she would not convert, and asked why she, not her co-workers, should change religion.It has been claimed that she disparaged the Prophet Mohammed during the heated discussion that followed. She emphatically denies this – and insists the allegations were invented to frame her.          Her trouble started when she drew water from this hand pump near Ittan Wali village If so, it is a scenario familiar to many of the nearly three million Christians in Pakistan, out of a total population of 165 million. The blasphemy laws, it is widely acknowledged, have long been used against them, not as a system of organised persecution, but simply as a way of settling petty disputes.After the row, Asia ran back home crying and told Ashiq what had happened. He told her not to worry, and he seemed to be correct as there were no further incidents for the next five days.But on Friday, the Muslim religious day, Asia returned to work in the falsa fields, unaware that a mile away, the village imam, Qari Muhammad Salaam, was stirring up the villagers by announcing on the mosque loudspeakers that she had committed blasphemy.The first she was aware of any trouble was hearing a low rumble of voices, then the terrifying chant: ‘Kill the Christian!’She realised the men were coming for her and soon they appeared on a ridge. She had nowhere to run. In a panic, she stumbled, dizzy with fear, and a minute or so later felt hands roughly grab her arms and shoulders while another man fitted a leather noose around her neck.          Mrs Bibi lived with her family in this house in Ittan Wali village in Pakistan\u0027s Punjab regionHauled to her feet, she was paraded back to the village – led by the leather strap – and taken to a courtyard in the house of the village leader, where more than 100 people had gathered, including imams from neighbouring villages. It seemed that a makeshift sharia court was being convened.The village imam was flanked by the two sisters and Asia was flung at his feet. He told her: ‘You’ve made derogatory remarks about our Prophet. You know what happens to people who insult the Prophet. You can redeem yourself by accepting Islam.’Asia protested her innocence and said she did not want to convert. At this, the crowd became increasingly hostile and began jeering and spitting. Asia was then whipped with sticks and sandals. Then, in a form of ritual humiliation, someone smeared her face with black dye while others held her down.One of Asia’s daughters tried to intervene but was grabbed by her hair and her face smashed against a door. Another daughter, Isham, then nine, could only watch, terrified and powerless.

Gambling giant Bet365 – whose UK boss Denise Coates (pictured) last year earned £265 million – has based its international operations on Gibraltar since 2014Both sides have tried to arrive at an agreement.However, Spain\u0027s insistence on eventually obtaining total sovereignty over the territory, allied to the UK\u0027s determination to keep full control of Gibraltar\u0027s military bases, have proved serious stumbling blocks. So too has the local population\u0027s determination to remain British.The Rock\u0027s 2006 constitution stipulates that there can be no transfer of sovereignty to Spain against the wishes of its voters.In a referendum in 2002, Gibraltarians resoundingly rejected the idea of joint sovereignty between the UK and Spain.Free travel between Spain and Gibraltar was fully restored in 1985, but travellers continued to suffer delays at the border.In late 2006, passenger flights between Spain and Gibraltar resumed for the first time in nearly 30 years, though seven years later there were renewed border checks by Spain in response to a Gibraltarian plan to build an artificial reef.The 2006 air link was restored after Gibraltar, Spain and Britain signed agreements aimed at improving living conditions on the Rock.In the 2016 EU referendum, the Rock voted overwhelmingly against Brexit.And even though the UK overall did not, Gibraltar\u0027s leaders have made clear they prefer to follow the motherland out of the EU.But for Madrid, Brexit represents a golden opportunity to overturn three centuries of history and stage their own bid to \u0027take back control\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"ALEXANDRA SHULMANS NOTEBOOK UAE nation woman spied on","story":"    Alexandra Shulman visited the UAE to speak at the Sharjah Book Fair (pictured) last yearUp the road is the more lenient Dubai, where I met up with a group of young women in the Dubai Mall’s Armani cafe to discuss life in the UAE. They all arrived modestly dressed, in flowing gowns (abayas), trousers covering the ankle, headscarves – and wonderful eye make-up.They were a sophisticated, highly educated and well-travelled group fashion designers, journalists, a financier. But nonetheless I found them baffling.When I asked about the traditional dress code they insisted that they weren’t under any pressure to dress this way and that it was entirely their choice not to be disrespectful to Emirati tradition. It marked them out from the masses of tourists and expats wandering around with their cut off denims and sleeveless dresses.Indeed, they didn’t voice a word of complaint about a single aspect of the society they inhabit, unlike us Westerners for whom complaining about our lot is a way of life. Most striking of all was their total acceptance of – indeed praise for – the staggering degree of surveillance in the UAE where the state monitors their every movement.          When asked about the traditional dress code women insisted that they weren’t under any pressure to dress this way and that it was entirely their choice (stock picture)Rather than finding the wall- to-wall CCTV cameras and the interception of their texts, WhatsApp and email a chilling invasion of their privacy, they lauded it as empowering.Far from objecting to the scrutiny, they all agreed it made them feel safer to go about their work and lives. ‘I can walk home alone from my studio at five in the morning without any fear,’ one explained. ‘In fact, I don’t know what I’d have to do to be raped here.’ Not a sentiment that I imagine is shared by the thousands of female, migrant workers locked into abusive domestic employment in the region.My dad’s tax tip: Just blow the lotOnce again there’s talk of reforming inheritance tax because the current system is too confusing. It’s a subject that generates a great deal of heat – despite the fact that, of the 570,000 people who die each year, only 30,000 leave large enough estates to qualify for it. Partly this is because inheritance tax tends to hit middle-class media commentators like me and partly because it’s distressing to have to deal with at a time of grief.There is, however, one way to avoid it which is the method adopted by my father.He felt that, in providing his offspring with a good education and comfortable childhood, he had fulfilled his financial obligations and there was no need for us to inherit anything.So he cheerfully spent every penny he had. My sole takeaway after his death was a white Perspex 1960s cigarette box which I nabbed as a nostalgic memento from the rented flat where we all lived.What’s the emoji for ‘I haven’t got a clue’?Last month Apple introduced 70 more emojis to the iPhone, including grey hair and bald heads so that nobody feels left out.But all those darling little symbols are wasted on me.I don’t speak emoji and can never understand what’s being said. With my slightly dodgy eyesight I can’t work out the different nuances of expression and I can never judge whether the tears streaming down the little face are of laughter or misery.These days it’s hard enough trying not to say the wrong thing to some constituency or other, without also having to worry whether you’ve posted an emoji that’s going to cause offence.Misery of a saggy bottomed ChristmasAlexandra Shulman\u0027s Notebook: Children are better off with both parents, Angelina...Alexandra Shulman\u0027s Notebook: When did Britain\u0027s dogs get so spoilt?

In three years time, cameras will be in place to record the first wave of UK driverless vehicles – an autonomous bus service linking Fife with Edinburgh.News of the pilots – another is planned for taxis in London – was carefully timed. The government launched its industrial strategy a year ago and wanted to be able to show there had been progress.There is a paradox here. Theresa May stressed when she became prime minister that an industrial strategy was needed to spread prosperity across the nation and so deal with the reasons that people voted for Brexit. But Brexit has used up vast amounts of the government’s bandwidth to the extent that it has tended to crowd out everything else.Just to take one example, it was rightly seen as important that progress towards meeting the aims of the industrial strategy would be assessed independently. An industrial strategy council to do the job was promised within months: in the end it took the best part of a year before it was set up under the chairmanship of Andy Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England. Industry bodies wonder whether the delay suggests that the government is not as fully committed to the industrial strategy (IS) as its says it is – and they have a point.The low profile adopted by the business secretary Greg Clark hasn’t exactly helped either. Michael Gove’s proactive approach at Environment shows that it is possible – despite the noises off – for cabinet ministers to say things that draw attention to the initiatives they are interested in. But as one industrial policy expert put it: “Clark is a wallflower. He is not interested in promoting himself.”In Clark’s defence, industrial strategy is a slow burn. Once the government has listed its priorities and provided some funding (which it actually has in this case) there is inevitably quite a long delay before anything happens. Sorting out Britain’s productivity problem – the aim of the strategy – is going to be a long, hard process in which there are not that many quick wins.Few would quibble with the government’s list of issues that need to be tackled: Britain needs to innovate more, invest in people so that they can get better jobs upgrade the nation’s infrastructure create the right environment to set up a business and make sure that prosperous communities are spread right across the country.Quite clearly, the IS is a throwback to an earlier age, to the time in the early 1960s when the Macmillan government created the National Economic Development Council, a tripartite body that brought together politicians, trade unionists and employers. May’s idea that the government should build strategic partnerships with business through sector deals smacks of the corporatism that Margaret Thatcher loathed.The emphasis on sectors working at the technological frontier is unsurprising and – up to a point – sensible. If the world is on the cusp of a fourth industrial revolution, there will be big profits for the companies that move quickly. That’s why the IS is big on artificial intelligence, driverless cars and clean growth.But there are three problems here. One is that the focus on whizzy industries does very little to tackle productivity. Far more attention needs to be paid to the less glamorous sectors that make up what the IPPR thinktank called the everyday economy in its recent commission on economic justice.Gareth Stace, the director-general of the industry body UK Steel agrees. He is disappointed that the government has not done anything about energy costs, which mean British firms pay £50m a year more than they would in Germany, and is deaf to pleas that investment in new plant and machinery should not be penalised by increases in business rates. “A year on, the steel sector is still waiting to see any benefits coming from the industrial strategy,” he said.A second problem is that the new hi-tech fourth industrial revolution companies tend to be concentrated in the more prosperous parts of Britain, and that bias will become even more pronounced with the development of the Oxford to Cambridge corridor as a single knowledge-intensive cluster.Finally, there is the question of whether the government is merely paying lip service to the need to back the industries of the future. Clean energy is supposed to be a priority, but renewable sources of power were not mentioned in Philip Hammond’s recent budget and the government is proposing to remove payments for small-scale suppliers who export power to the grid. Quite clearly, it is sending out conflicting signals.Ultimately, the risk is that the IS tries to do too many things and does none of them very well. If, for example, the government wants to back an industry of the future, it should pick one – green technology – and really commit to it.The warnings about the threat of climate change have come thick and fast in the year since the industrial strategy was first published. There is a pressing need to decarbonise the economy by building more energy efficient homes, improving the insulation of the existing housing stock, improving local transport links, and accelerating the switch to renewables.Jobs would be created, skills would be upgraded, fossil fuel dependency would be lessened, and prosperity would be more evenly shared across the countryBut it will only happen if the government uses its full range of policy tools – regulation, public spending, procurement, tax, and state-funded R\u0026ampD. That requires far more commitment and focus than it has showed thus far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b39a5ae462ce5084edecc63658ff743d68da14e5/0_342_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1f03a303ce0600fb77a32248a384089","title":"a glimpse of daily life in pyongyang in pictures","story":"North Korea’s capital is a carefully managed showcase for its dictatorship.

Now, with Trump in office, it’s mainstreamConspiracy theories have generally had a bad press. They conjure up images of eccentrics in tinfoil hats who believe that aliens have landed and the government is hushing up the news. And maybe it’s statistically true that most conspiracy theories belong on the harmless fringe of the credibility spectrum.On the other hand, the historical record contains some conspiracy theories that have had profound effects. Take the “stab in the back” myth, widely believed in Germany after 1918, which held that the German army did not lose the First World War on the battlefield but was betrayed by civilians on the home front. When the Nazis came to power in 1933 the theory was incorporated in their revisionist narrative of the 1920s: the Weimar Republic was the creation of the “November criminals” who stabbed the nation in the back to seize power while betraying it. So a conspiracy theory became the inspiration for the political changes that led to a second global conflict.More recent examples relate to the alleged dangers of the MMR jab and other vaccinations and the various conspiracy theories fuelling denial of climate change.For the last five years, my academic colleagues – historian Richard Evans and politics professor David Runciman – and I have been leading a team of researchers studying the history, nature and significance of conspiracy theories with a particular emphasis on their implications for democracy. The research (funded by a grant from the Leverhulme Trust) enabled us to take the long view of a phenomenon that has always been a feature of human societies and yet has generally been treated with condescending disdain by scholars and mainstream media alike.When we embarked on the study, the general thrust of scholarly research on conspiracism was towards explanation. How is it that human beings come to believe weird propositions? Is it a question of psychology? Or culture? Or social conditioning? From the outset, and to the bafflement of some of our peers, we decided to leave explaining the “why” to others and to focus instead on three areas: what a 19th-century philosopher might call the “natural history” of a widespread human and social phenomenon, the role of conspiracy theories in democracies and on the impact of the internet (which was my strand of the inquiry).Since much of the literature on conspiracism has tended to focus on the United States, possibly because of the influence of a famous article by Richard Hofstadter, The Paranoid Style in American Politics, published in 1994, we needed to widen the inquiry to a less-studied area – Europe. We then worked with the polling organisation YouGov to conduct a number of surveys of the pervasiveness and nature of conspiracist beliefs in European countries.The findings of our final poll, released last Friday, make interesting or disturbing (depending on your point of view) reading for anyone who believes that our continent is immune to strange beliefs and convictions. It makes striking comparisons between European and American conspiracist beliefs and between what Brexit and Trump voters believe.How has the internet affected all this? Our research showed that conspiracy theorists were early adopters, in that they perceived the unique usefulness of the early (pre-social media) web for people who believed propositions that would never get past the editorial gatekeepers of mainstream media. So part of the blogosphere was occupied by conspiracy theorists and what one might call conspiracist entrepreneurs: examples include those espousing the “new world order” conspiracy theory, David Icke with his “lizard” theory and Alex Jones with his InfoWars site. These and other sites became key nodes in an infrastructure of conspiracist and far-right discussion that lay beneath the radar of polite society and mainstream media.This is probably why many people who thought about these things initially dismissed online conspiracism as a politically irrelevant phenomenon. As one cynic put it to me, at least it keeps fanatics in their pyjamas and off the streets. And in one sense that was true: the conventional wisdom was that conspiracy theories – off- or online – had little democratic significance. Two developments changed that. The first was the arrival of global social media platforms such as Facebook whose automated advertising engines could be weaponised by political agents and entrepreneurial conspiracists. The second was the arrival of Donald Trump and the rise of populism across the western world.Trump, a paradigmatic conspiracy theorist, proved to be a masterful exploiter of social media, which he deployed to bring conspiracist thinking out from the shadows and into the mainstream. And conspiracy theorising, as Jan-Werner Müller and others point out, is part of the inner logic of populism. Populism, remember, is based on the claim that society is ided between “the people” and the illegitimate elites who rule and exploit them. This is useful not only for campaigning, but for when populists get into power and discover that governing is more difficult than they thought. Why? Because others are conspiring against them, of course.John Naughton is a senior research fellow in the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH) at Cambridge University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6858658695d3239f67f3e97734c154ea9b3fc2b3/0_8_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66d1d5ad2681ac8fbfeb2c84101c7e0e","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sharp","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sharp’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sharp’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what sharp means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 28 November at 10am.

Stringer hopes the 65-70cm long predators will create gaps in the forest’s ecosystem for rarer species, such as red squirrels and goldcrests, which are better adapted to avoiding martens. “They are going to eat what is most common, like grey squirrels and wood pigeons,” he says.In Ireland red squirrels are starting to establish themselves in counties where martens have eradicated greys, which are native to north America.Chris Sandom from the University of Sussex, who is contributing to a book on rewilding, has identified 24 other rewilding projects across the UK, including the reintroduction of beavers in Devon and white-tailed eagles in Scotland. “Rewilding is about nature taking the lead rather than managing nature,” he says. “It is an idea that is gaining momentum.”Stringer accepts rewilding is controversial for some landowners but he sees it as vital to making our ecosystems sustainable. “Predation is a classic natural process that is missing from our landscape. That is why species reintroduction is associated with rewilding,” he says.Dogwalkers enjoying the last hours of daylight are also excited by the prospect of pine martens returning to the Forest of Dean. Debra Clough, who lives in nearby Cinderford, says: “It’s a great idea. We’ve got to learn to live with all these things. We’ve rather taken over I think.”Even gamekeepers, whose Victorian predecessors hunted pine martens to extinction in much of the country to boost gamebird numbers, back the plan. “Our attitudes have changed,” says Tim Weston from the National Gamekeepers’ Organisation. “We canvassed local gamekeepers and they’re not opposed.”But Weston adds that pine martens repeatedly targeting gamebird pens or hens on small-holdings should be culled or relocated. “If you have one inidual continually raiding a chicken house there needs to be mitigating measures,” he says.The forest has already seen the return of another emblematic animal of the British countryside this year. A pair of beavers were introduced in July by the Forestry Commission as part of a trial to establish if the dam-building mammals are able to reduce the risk of flash flooding.However other recent wild arrivals in the forest are more isive. In the late 90s wild boar were illegally released and there are now an estimated 1,600 roaming free in the forest.As a freezing mist settles over the dark tree-covered hills, rare-pig farmer Richard Vaughan checks on a pair of his prized middle white sows with their litter of piglets. He fears they could pick up African swine fever, which is spreading through Europe, from wild boar. “You’ve only got to have a wild boar eating a half-eaten sandwich made with infected meat and we’ve got African swine flu in this country,” he says.Vaughan, who has shot 46 wild boar on his 500-acre farm so far this year, says environmentalists need to be careful about releasing wild animals. “It very easy to say ‘Oh we need wild boar, we need wolves, we need lynx, now I’m going back to my nice semi in Surbiton’ but I have to live with the consequences,” he says.Locals in nearby Lydbrook also complain about boars. John Jones, at the village’s garage, says he sees cars damaged by collisions with boar every week. “I don’t know much about pine martens. But wild boar cause a lot of problems here,” he says.Nicky England, who is serving drinkers at the Jovial Colliers Inn, is still keen on bringing back pine martens. “I think it’s a good idea especially if they are native to this area,” she says. “Although they are introducing a predator, it’s still good for wildlife – it’s the circle of life.”For Stringer there are no parallels between martens, which are preyed on by foxes, and wild boar. “It is not an example of a reintroduction going wrong – it was an illegal release. If a feasibility study had been done then you would have seen there are no predators for boars – no wolves in the ecosystem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a568dfb14112587ebd441d4a80433d6026aa2968/0_291_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7161b0a61d0755e4801c966063db96b","title":"boots riley musician director sorry to bother you interview","story":"The musician turned director discusses how firsthand experience, and having Dave Eggers as a fan, shaped his hit debut movie, Sorry to Bother YouBy the time I meet him, Boots Riley has been promoting his movie Sorry to Bother You for the best part of nine months. It dropped with a splash at the Sundance film festival in January – but the veteran rapper and political organiser, now 47, is clearly still delighted to discuss his gleefully disruptive entrance into the world of film-making. “It’s all related to things I care about,” he says.Tracking the moral dilemmas of penniless Cassius Green (Lakeith Stanfield, who gave a standout performance in Get Out) as he rises through the ranks of a shady telemarketing firm, Sorry to Bother You reflects on the challenges of being black in America and gives Riley space to argue – in freakishly satirical terms – why it’s worth taking a stand against the predations of capitalism.Born in Chicago in 1971 and moving to the city of Oakland, California, six years later, Riley was steeped in politics from an early age. His parents were social justice organisers and their son followed suit, joining the Marxist-Leninist Progressive Labor party at 15. In 1991, he formed hip-hop collective the Coup and went on to release six politically charged albums, notably 1998’s acclaimed Steal This Album.Riley, who lives in Oakland with musician Gabby La La and their child, is a genial presence. Clad in a distinctive red-and-black check suit, he delivers carefully weighed answers in a deep, measured drawl, punctuated by the occasional wry chuckle. A large plate of cheese sits between us, untouched for the duration of the interview.You must have been pretty good at it…Yeah, I’m good at listening to people and figuring out what it is that they’re really saying.In the film, Cassius hits the jackpot when he discovers his “white voice”. Was that a detail from your days in telemarketing?Yeah. Nobody ever talked about it, but you’d know what to do. You’d try to obscure the fact that you’re black, just on the very basic level of trying to make someone feel like you’re like them, and on the more racist level of someone being OK giving you their credit card information.How did you get into politics?When I was 14, a youth organiser came by my house with a van full of 14-year-old girls. They said: “Do you want to go to the beach?” I was like: “Hell yeah.” Then they said: “But first we’re going to go to the Watsonville cannery workers’ strike and support them.” I was like: “OK.” Through that, I became involved with summer projects that helped out farm workers. At the same time, I was involved with everything from sales and retail jobs to theatre to selling weed to music to throwing parties.You’ve continued to be politically engaged over the years…Yeah, when Occupy came around, I was working on the album that was to become Sorry to Bother You, the 2012 one, and I had to call up the label and say: “It’s going to be some more months, because this is what I’ve got to be doing.”You identify as a communist. What do you mean when you say you’re a communist?I think that the people should democratically control the wealth that we create with our labour. Whereas at this point, most of the value we produce is being hoarded and used as power over us. Most people will agree that we should democratically control the wealth that we create with our labour. The question is, how do we get there? How is that organised? I don’t claim to have the answers. A lot of people, especially on the left, will sit around arguing about what colour the buses should be when we have a world like that, but the real point is, that’s the world we need to be working towards. There are people who have said that they were working for that world, and some were being disingenuous, some were being sincere. All have made mistakes. Why? Because that’s what you do in life, is make mistakes. But that’s the world that we should be working for. We’re not going to get there without a struggle. It’s not going to get voted in.As corporations get ever more powerful and inequality rises, is it hard to remain optimistic?My optimism doesn’t have to do with the scoreboard, it has to do with who’s up to bat.In August, you criticised Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman on Twitter, calling the film, which is based on a memoir by retired black police officer Ron Stallworth, “a made-up story in which the false parts of it try to make a cop the protagonist in the fight against racist oppression”. What compelled you to speak out?I felt it was important. Spike Lee is a hero of mine, the person who compelled me to go to film school. But this film was putting out a certain idea of history in the time of Black Lives Matter and the rise of a new white supremacist movement, when the police are actually working with these white supremacist groups.Has Spike Lee responded to you directly?No. I got my information to him through Dave Chappelle, but I haven’t heard back.Has it changed much over the years?Oh, definitely. It still feels like my home, but it also feels like a ghost town to a certain extent, even though it’s more developed than it’s ever been. When everyone was urging me to go to LA, I fought to stay in Oakland because that’s what grounds my art. But I needed to fight for everybody else to stay in Oakland too. That’s why I’m behind this rent control thing that’s happening right now.Will you make more films?I have a deal with Michael Ellenberg, who brought Game of Thrones to HBO, and I’m doing my own TV series with him. I’m writing and directing an episode for Guillermo del Toro’s horror anthology series 10 After Midnight. And then I’m writing a couple of films. I’ve waited a long time, I’m 47, so I’ve got to get a lot of stuff done.Sorry to Bother You opens in the UK on 7 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bacedef81dc76c7b16f1c1753b09a58b9725321/158_45_2170_1302/master/2170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a9f95a4b67b436ce01c5e85feeb21cb","title":"nicolas roeg a life in pictures","story":"Film director and cinematographer Nic Roeg has died at the age of 90.

The Gunners are a cut above Brighton and controlled the game pretty much from start to finish. The visitors will be pleased with what they offered and were close to going 2-0 up just before the equaliser but they stuck at it and showed a few glimpses of quality throughout. 90 min: Off the line! A corner was headed back across goal by Bloodworth but Perry was waiting on the post and headed it onto her own bar before smashing it clear.88 min: Arsenal are looking for a fifth goal here and that’s about all there is to report.They make their final substitution as Miedema is replaced by Grant. 86 min: The final change for Brighton sees Green depart, with Brett replacing her for the closing stages. 84 min: All pretty quiet at Meadow Park. Arsenal are just tapping it around with not long left on the clock. 82 min: Youngsters Kuyken and Bailey-Grant are now on for Arsenal. Not that it was ever in doubt but that certainly is game over. Great work from Van de Donk saw her win the ball and drive 35 yards from deep before laying it across to Mead on the edge of the area, allowing her to cut in and curl a shot over Hourihan into the top corner. 79 min: A 30-yard free-kick is curled straight into the arms of Hourihan by McCabe. Not a great shot, if we’re being honest. 77 min: The commentary has now moved onto Martin Keown’s pen of choice. It might be a sign that this hasn’t been a classic half of football. 75 min: Brazil certainly has the requisite energy, she just ran about 40 yards in possession to relieve the pressure for Brighton until forcing Mitchell to tackle her. A minute late she then sent a deep cross onto Umotong’s head but her glanced effort went inches wide. 73 min: Hope Powell seems to be wearing sunglasses. I am not sure this is required in late-November in north London. 71 min: Mead and Barton is a good battle down the right flank. The defender just pulled the Arsenal player back when she got the better of her.A quick free-kick was played through to Miedema but her shot from inside the area was straight at Hourihan who successfully palmed it clear. 69 min: Mead went down after a strong challenge from Barton. The Brighton defender got the ball but both seem to have come off badly from it. They have both got up at least. 67 min: Oh ... the Arsenal fans are now singing Christmas songs. It’s a month until Christmas. I am very much against this. 65 min: Umotong has been all over the pitch today and has just performed a tackle to put the ball out for a corner. In tough circumstances she has certainly given her all for the cause. 63 min: There are some hardcore supporters at the game who have been singing since the first whistle. 61 min: A Mead free-kick eventually made its way to Williamson inside the area but all she could do was smash the ball out of the stadium (it’s not a big ground, to be fair).59 min: Brazil is yet to see much of the ball out of the right since coming on for Brighton, but the whole team have not had much possession since the changing of ends. Brazil mainly seems to be on to bring freshness to the side. 57 min: Brighton only became full-time over the summer when they stepped up to this level and they are now looking pretty tired here. They have played a few slack balls and don’t look able to chase Arsenal as much. 55 min: Mead cut in from the right, along the edge of the area before unleashing a left-footed drive across goal but it flew just wide of Hourihan’s right post. Ps Phil Neville has now left. 53 min: It’s all Arsenal here at the moment. Brighton are just about keeping them out but surely the league leaders are going to get a few more goals.51 min: Arsenal instigated a counter-attack when the ball was sent for Miedema to chase down the flank, she cut inside but her cross found only a Brighton defender who cleared. Moments later Evans fired a low shot towards goal but it was blocked on its way. 49 min: Arsenal earned a free-kick 25 yards from goal, which Bloodworth hit against the wall, allowing Hourihan to come and claim before the ball bounced wide. 47 min: Evans has the first shot of the second-half after Brighton failed to clear a cross but the Arsenal player sent it well over the bar from 12 yards out. Here we go again!Brazil has come on for Brighton, replacing Legg. Umotong is discussing her first class degree and how she was bullied for being the only girl playing football. She seems incredibly impressive. The league leaders have been utterly dominant here. Although they went a goal behind, they have barely been without the ball in the opening 45 minutes and could be out of sight by now. Hourihan has looked good in the Brighton goal and she has had plenty to do.45 min: The Arsenal players were shouting for a penalty after a cross bounced up onto Perry’s arm. It would have been very very harsh.43 min: Brighton will just be aiming to get into the break with just a two-goal deficit. 41 min: This could be a cricket score now. Brighton are just trying to hold on.Here is the second Arsenal goal ...A Mead corner found Van de Donk on the edge of the six-yard box from where she headed home. 37 min: Miedema could have had six today alone. Her latest effort arrived when she flew past a defender near the byline and fired a shot to the near post but Hourihan used her legs once again to repel her shot.35 min: Is there any way back for Brighton or just a question of keeping the score down? It’s probably the latter but there is enough to be positive about in their first-half performance here. They look comfortable on the ball and Umotong has shown that she is difficult to contend with. Finally Arsenal are int he lead, it was good work on the byline from Miedema who pulled a throw-in into the path of Bloodworth who calmly slotted her shot beyond Hourihan. 32 min: A lot of pressure on Brighton here who don’t seem to have got out of their own half since the equaliser. Bloodworth tried her luck from 30 yards but a defender deflected her effort wide. The resulting corner then made it back to Bloodworth whose close range shot was blocked by a determined defender. 30 min: Brighton just managed to clear a corner from the right when it looked like it was about to land on an Arsenal head. 28 min: Hourihan claimed a free-kick but then rolled it straight out to an Arsenal player, allowing them to build a new attack. Brighton need to get back on it here otherwise things are going to get a lot worse.The goalkeeper than made a double save when a deep cross was volleyed at goal by Miedema but Hourihan stopped it with her feet, something she replicated when McCabe smashed the rebound at her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95294d9054ec0963b07754dc5c6c6755ed260715/0_92_1703_1022/master/1703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43e252f367bd5985b88b3b69801c1240","title":"bournemouth v arsenal premier league live","story":"46 mins: You’ll be pleased to learn that shadows now broadly cover the pitch so the linesman’s problem with the sunshine is reduced. The second-half is underway, and Brooks dances delicately down the left, but his cross is easily claimed by Leno. The players are back out, and we’re back on for the second-half. More body part chat from Kristof in Berlin: “Back when Darmstadt still played Bundesliga football, we had the exact same body part constellation when they faced (!) Dortmund. Think about it...”It’s possible I’ve just posted something extremely rude in German there. Apologies. Decent half that. Probably just about right that it’s level, although with some more precise finishing Arsenal would be ahead. That really was a special equaliser though: Iwobi will get some criticism for giving the ball away because he was dispossessed trying a roulette in Bournemouth’s box, but he was trying to get himself out of a tight space and if a forward can’t try something there, there’s something wrong elsewhere in the team.45 mins + 1: With seconds remaining in the only minute of stoppage time, Iwobi loses the ball in Bournemouth’s box and the hosts counter at pace. Wilson squares to Brooks, who contemplates a shot before spotting Josh King in more space on the right of the box, and he opens his body and whistles the cleanest strike you could wish to see into the top corner. Smashing goal. On the absolute stroke of the stroke of half-time!45 mins: Lerma stabs a pass through that flicks off an Arsenal player for Brooks...but again he’s flagged offside. And again he might just have been on...but that was a tight decision. No big criticism for the lino there.43 mins: A nascent set-to involving Brooks and Xhaka is doused and prevented from becoming a stramash. 42 mins: “Well, I’ve noticed that Mkhitaryan is playing,” writes former US president (well, sounds like it) Richard T.W. Arthur, “Misplaced passes, dawdling on the ball, ballooning the ball into the stands, failing to track back...Why the heck is he preferred to Ramsey?”Ramsey’s rubbish, don’t you know? So rubbish they are letting him leave for nothing. 40 mins: There’s Bellerin again, sliding to keep the ball in play at the byline, and his cut back eventually falls to Mkhitaryan outside the box, but his first time shot nearly clears the stand, never mind the bar. 39 mins: Arsenal nearly get a second: Mkhitaryan finally does something of note by slipping a nice pass to Bellerin down the right, he cuts it back and Iwobi’s right foot is cocked, but Cook (I think) nips in to clear. 37 mins: Bournemouth try a free-kick routine which involves Fraser pretending to take it, then Brooks pretending to take it, then Fraser actually taking it, but it was all a colossal waste of time as the cross barely beat the first man. 36 mins: If you’re not familiar with this film...keep it that way. I beg you. 35 mins: Henrikh Mkhitaryan is playing. I only mention it because I’ve only just noticed. “I’m happily watching a very good Arsenal side beating Brighton on TV’s red button,” writes Charles Antaki, “while listening to the other, less good, Arsenal side is struggling against Bournemouth. All I’m hearting is rising hoots of derision - and now an own goal. Remind me, which is the better league?”The better league is whichever one you prefer, Chaz. 34 mins: Arsenal on top now: Bournemouth again give an Arsenal player a bit too much space from outside the box, this time Iwobi, and he opens up his body to try a right-footed curler into the corner, but Begovic es and makes the save.32 mins: Incidentally, for all the people suggesting Bournemouth v Arsenal in the body parts note (15 mins): that was Matt’s nomination. He was talking about this game. Obviously.30 mins: Good lord! Kolasinac cuts back from the left side of the box, it looks like a poor pass as no Arsenal player was anywhere close to where he played it, but Lerma slides, stretches and absolutely rifles the ball past his own keeper from the edge of the box. Remarkable.27 mins: This time Fraser takes, sends it towards the top corner and Leno makes a brilliant save, but it wouldn’t have counted anyway because the referee had blown for a foul. 26 mins: Slapstick! Referee Pawson is lecturing the players in the box as the free-kick is lined up, but Brooks tries a backheel to widen the angle for Fraser. Problem is, Fraser stands stock still, so an Arsenal defender happily accepts the donation - BUT WAIT! The referee hasn’t blown his whistle, so much to the mystifying chagrin of anyone to do with Arsenal, they have to take it again...25 mins: Sokratis and King chase a long pass from Daniels down the Bournemouth left, the big Greek and the smaller Norwegian grapple heartily, but it’s the former who is penalised and they have a free-kick on the edge of the box.23 mins: Good period for Arsenal: it’s Kolasinac this time who receives a cross at the back post, but while he gets some oomph behind the header, it is off target. 22 mins: ...which drops to Aubameyang at the back stick, but he snatches at the half-volley a little and it goes over the bar. 21 mins: Hmmm, slightly odd one as muscle man Kolasinac skims over a cross from the left, Begovic gets his legs all of a tizzy and has to flap the ball over the bar rather than catching it. Corner to Arsenal...18 mins: This Arsenal defensive experiment has been a...mixed success so far. Mustafi might have been booked for that challenge on Fraser and went to ground far too early for the Brooks disallowed goal, Holding has looked a bit more drowning than waving a couple of times and Sokratis almost just donated a chance to Wilson, but the Bournemouth forward couldn’t quite keep the ball in play.15 mins: Here’s Matt Davies-Adams (who, fun fact, attended the same Nottinghamshire comprehensive school as both me and much better  journalist Daniel Taylor), with a crucial question: “Is this the only PL fixture where both teams include body parts in their names?”13 mins: Mustafi flies in to what we’ll call a ‘thorough’ challenge on Fraser, taking the ball but also a bit of the man. He earns a mild rebuke from the referee, but nothing more. 12 mins: I confidently stated that Brooks was offside for that ‘goal’ earlier, but a replay suggested that the final touch may have come off an Arsenal defender. And he might not actually have been offside when the touch was taken. But other than that it was a solid call from both official and minute-by-minuter.11 mins: “Re your statement that there hasn’t been much goalmouth action: would you say that this has been an intriguing tactical battle?” writes Adam Kline-Schoder. Why yes, funny you should mention that. Although those two incidents have shifted this from intriguing into actually good. 9 mins: And like me after a batch of what we suspect was some dodgy reheated rice a while back, there’s now action at both ends - Lucas Torreira is frankly afforded too much space just outside the box, so he narrows his eyes and fires in the shot, but it thunks against the post. The rebound falls to Iwobi, but he shanks it way askew. 8 mins: But there is now! Brooks has the ball in the net, a lovely tucked finish ‘neath Bernd Leno, but his right foot was offside and the eagle-eyed lino - not the one squinting into the yellow sun - popped his flag up. 7 mins: As that last entry might tell you, there hasn’t been much goalmouth action at either end. 6 mins: The sun is shining right in the lino’s eyes in the Bournemouth half. Any Arsenal player might want to chance their arms with some borderline offside runs, if they’re comfortable taking advantage of a compromised official.3 mins: Gosling slips a pass to King running into that space on the left of Arsenal’s defence, Rob Holding napping rather, but his cross is hoyed way over Callum Wilson’s head. 2 mins: Duncan Edwards is confused. “Since the  has recently praised Eddie Howe that normally would jinx the result in favour of Arsenal except there’s also been an article praising Unai Emery. Therefore I’m saying it’ll be a close game, which normally means it’ll be a 3-0 win for someone. Help.”1 min: We’re away. Bournemouth on the attack straight away but Josh King’s flicked pass looking for David Brooks is cut out.Reminder that if Bournemouth win today they’ll go sixth, a mere point behind their opponents...The players are out on the pitch. This means the match is about to start. The football match. Yes! Eddie Howe speaks: “From our perspective we’re keen to get back to a good performance. Against Newcastle we didn’t really get going. There are subtle differences with Arsenal - they’ve still got good players, they’re outstanding technically, maybe defensively they’ve changed things slightly, but we’re in for a tough game as they did last season.”This isn’t the only Arsenal team playing today: their women’s team is doing rather well against Brighton, and you can follow that one with William Unwin.Pre-match reading? Pre-match reading. Here’s Jacob Steinberg on Eddie Howe and Bournemouth. Enjoy.Now I am watching an English series to improve my English. Peaky Blinders. It is good but it is difficult (to understand), from Birmingham. And it’s very aggressive. But it’s good, it’s good.”But what does it mean? Almost certainly nothing! Fun though. INTRIGUING team selections there. Looks like Emery has gone for three at the back, for - I think, correct me if I’m wrong - the first time this season, possibly in anticipation of Bournemouth doing the same. But they do not do the same, opting for a sort of 4-3-34-2-3-14-4-1-1 thing. Ozil and Ramsey are on the bench, and Alex Lacazette is nowhere to be seen - apparently he has a mild groin twang, and like the most precious ornaments when a child comes to visit, he must not be risked.The autumn was great for these two teams. Who doesn’t love the autumn? Beautiful golden trees, loads of sport, cool enough that you can wear your good jackets but not so cold you get frostbite going to the shop. It is the best season, and I won’t hear otherwise.Bournemouth and Arsenal seemed to enjoy it too. In September and October they played 21 games between them in all competitions, winning 17 and losing only two. Arsenal shook of the early season rust and life seemed good under Unai Emery. Bournemouth continued their extraordinary story from the nether regions of League One to being above Manchester United in the Premier League table.And then November arrived, the wind chilled a bit more and both started to stumble, just a little. Bournemouth lost their last two games before the international break - one a little unluckily to United, the other less excusably to Newcastle - while Arsenal have drawn four of their last five. Clearly neither of these are huge problems, but both are at interesting points of their respective seasons. Will these stumbles turn into falls? Or will they right themselves?Intriguing, when used to describe a football match, is usually a word that actually means ‘dull’, or ‘I’m trying to over-intellectualise a game that you poor plebs simply don’t understand, but it’s not your fault that you’re less intelligent than me.’ But in this case it genuinely is quite intriguing. Promise. Stick with us, anyway. Should be good. Kick-off is 13.30 GMT.

Kaku is a popular scientist. He has a knack for studying today’s trends in order to hypothesise what might come tomorrow – how we’ll live, where we’ll live, whether or not an almighty AI might soon rule over us. And he’s not the only one. Futurists have been conceptualising our potential fate for centuries, sometimes successfully. Perhaps, as we stumble through uncertain times, their work is more important now than ever. So what will the world look like in 2050? We asked Kaku and three other futurists to share their predictions.A theoretical physicist and futurist, Kaku is the author of several books of popular science, including the New York Times bestseller, The Future of the Mind: The Scientific Quest to Understand, Enhance, and Empower the Mind.By 2050 we’ll be able to send memories, emotions and feelings across the internet. Brain science will have exploded, and it will have revolutionised communication. Teenagers will love it. Instead of putting an emoticon at the end of every sentence, they’ll use an emotion: anger, happiness, excitement. This will replace entertainment movies will become obsolete. I’m talking about telepathy, really. We’ll still communicate the old-fashioned way, but communicating telepathically will reduce the obstacles between people. Our grandchildren will wonder, What is a keyboard? We will enter the age of the “brain net”.Medicine will develop exponentially, too. We will have cured certain forms of cancer, and we will have begun to treat the disease like the common cold. We’ll live with it. It will no longer be lethal. We won’t fear it like we used to. Technology will help in this respect. Smart toilets will perform liquid biopsies – which are already available – to detect cancer cells, genes and enzymes. We’ll catch tumours years or even decades before they form, when they’re just small colonies of several hundred cells circulating in the blood. Smart objects will measure our biometrics automatically. The iPhone can already calculate a pulse. In the future, our clothes will detect the beginnings of a heart attack, and advise us to seek treatment immediately.This results, naturally, in longevity. I don’t think we’ll be immortal by 2050, but we’ll be setting the foundations for immortality. We’re gradually discovering the genes that control the ageing process, and we’ll soon understand how to repair the biological damage inflicted on our bodies over the course of our lives. In this way, medicine will move past simply providing a cure, and will help move humanity closer to biological perfection. We will become gods. We’ll have the immortal body of Venus. The speed of Mercury. The power of the mind of Zeus.But what use is longevity without eternal youth? That’s where the idea of a human body shop comes in. We’ll grow organs to replace those that wear out. We can already use human cells to grow skin, cartilage, noses, ears, heart valves, bladders… In the future? We’ll grow the liver, the kidney, perhaps the pancreas. By 2050 I suspect we’ll be able to grow many of the vital organs of the body and, rather than allow the organs we’re born with to become old and decrepit, we’ll replace them. That’s all coming. And it doesn’t take much imagination to realise it.Astrophysicist and author deGrasse Tyson is the Frederick P Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York. His latest book is Accessory to War: The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military.If you were to create a settlement on an another planet, here’s the problem. In the old days, when settlers landed in some new place, they could breathe the air. They could repair their ships with wood from trees. Fruit grew on plants. Basic life support existed. But it won’t for the new generation of settlers. You cannot breathe on Mars, so you will need to seed the soil, generate oxygen – terraform it. That’s not an inconceivable future path for us, but it is a level of geo-engineering we’ve yet to master. When you’ve terraformed a planet, OK, we can talk about moving there. But until that happens we’d be living in a habitat that’s simulating Earth. And what’s the point in doing that? Antarctica is balmier and wetter than Mars, and you don’t see developers clambering to build condos in Antarctica.By 2050, I can imagine Mars becoming a vacation site. Instead of going to the beach, people will spend money to go and hang out in space. I’d do that! But that’s a business model that has yet to be set up. There’s no infrastructure. No way to make food or fuel. How would people get back to home-base Earth?If humanity wanted to – if we had the motivation – we might be able to turn at least the near solar system into our backyard. It will be difficult. Elon Musk famously said: “How do you build a small fortune in space? Start with a big fortune.” But if we were to manage it, we’d have access to what are essentially unlimited resources. Asteroids are rich in various metallic and mineral ingredients – rare Earth elements – that are fundamental to modern civilisation: gold, silver, platinum, iridium, cadmium, osmium. Comets have unlimited supplies of water. The world’s first trillionaire will be the first person to exploit these resources. Imagine having the capacity to distribute those resources where they are most needed around the world? Something like a third of conflicts are based on the limited access to resources. If, by 2050, we had unlimited global access, would those wars still exist?This all points to the growing importance of space, particularly for commerce. The future value of space assets won’t be measured by the amount of hardware that’s orbiting the Earth, but by the amount of commerce that hardware enables. Think about Uber. Its entire business model is founded on the existence of GPS satellites. Or Tinder. Want to date someone nearby? You’re relying on GPS. Satellites generate hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce. That’s a kind of power governments might call it “soft power”. So by 2050 space will have become a hotly contested zone.If there is conflict in the future, a nation’s best move might be to take out its enemy’s space assets, bringing down its economy. But would you use space to wage war on Earth, rather than to mine its resources and grow the world economy? Wherever you have a healthy economy, people tend to live longer and be happier. For 2050, that’s a noble goal.A best-selling author and futurist, Popcorn is also the founder and CEO of BrainReserve, a future-focussed strategic consultancy established in 1974.Human doctors have a problem: they’re human. They make mistakes. They don’t show up. They get sick. So algorithms will replace them, providing patients with the function of a doctor 247. Artificial intelligence will inform us very early on in our lives what we are allergic to, what our sensitivities are, how much exercise we require, what our stress levels are.We’re already finding that AI psychologists are extremely effective. They’re able to measure a patient’s responses to questions. They understand which questions provoke stress. They measure a patient’s biometrics during sessions. Human therapists can’t do that. They can’t take all that information in.This might all have happened by 2030, let alone 2050. By that point, science fiction will have become just science. Everything will be implanted: the ability to dispense medicine (the “robo-release”), the ability to predict cancer, the ability to measure the function of our heart or lungs. Tiny chips will be implanted within our bodies at birth, around the same moment you cut the umbilical cord. We will store our medical records in our fingertips.We won’t be having babies naturally by that point. Pregnancy will have become outdated. People will grow babies in labs, or their living rooms, in what look like fish tanks. And gender will have become irrelevant.Race will become obsolete, too. I predicted in 1988 that everybody will be brown, eventually. But what won’t become obsolete, and what could become problematic, is intelligence: how smart you can become through the AI you can buy, how many drugs you can afford to micro-dose throughout the day, to make you sharper and more able.There will be many people who don’t have the money to access new kinds of medical enhancement. There will be the people with, and the people without – unless a social class develops that decides to save those without. That could happen. Hopefully.A global security futurist and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, Washington DC, Zalman is the founder of the Strategic Narrative Institute, a futurist consultancy. Between 2014 and 2016 she was the CEO of the World Future Society.There’s a lovely phrase, attributed to the futurist Roy Amara, that goes like this: “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.” With this in mind, let’s consider work. We’re already discussing what kinds of jobs will be affected by automation. We know that some of the losers will be those with white-collar qualifications whose work is relatively routine: accountants, much of the work of lawyers, some of the work of journalists. But by 2050 we’ll begin to see paradigmatic changes. We have all these assumptions about how work and the world is shifting. But the changes occurring now are too incipient for us to get our heads around. It’s not that automation will change work. It’s that work will change so drastically that we’ll need to give what we do an entirely different name.The winners will be those people in jobs we don’t even know about yet, at the intersection of technology and other fields. Data and criminal justice. Data and homewares. Data and medical services. Data and biotechnology. It will be an exciting time for philosophers and ethicists. We’ll quickly realise the need to understand how we treat, use, manage and live with artificial intelligence. We’ll need philosophers and ethicists to legislate ourselves into the future.If there is a significant displacement from automation, we’ll require a tweak in the social services system. We’ll send people back to school. We’ll find new ways for people to make money. There will be experiments in the universal basic income. Eventually, we’ll create new forms of work. We’re kind of an ingenious race that way.But the one thing that seems unlikely to change in the next 30 years is wealth inequality. This will reverberate across generations. Some of us will continue to become really rich some of us will continue to become very poor. Inequality won’t rise from automation alone. It will continue to develop from the kind of economic reward system we’ve already established: that money makes money. That will lead to a biological ide in society, too. There will be a class of people able to enhance not only their education, as people have been able to do for decades – you go to a private school, you get a better education – but their own bodies, through other kinds of augmentation. Genetic enhancement, let’s say. Biological augmentation and enhancements are coming – a tattoo that acts as a system that monitors the body, for example. That could be expensive, and not necessarily available to all. In the future, only some people will have access."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69bd13251b21f8a12a04f9e49537de1b3fffa857/0_828_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cca9a37d9416c9f5cc868c9e916e0a0b","title":"james wong winter flowers scented fragrance camellia mimosa acacia","story":"As the days get darker, mimosa and camellia still deliver bursts of joy and colour in the gardenAs the days get ever shorter, it can feel harder and harder to get your horticultural fix. As a life-long plant obsessive who derives so much of his pleasure from seeing new leaves unfurl and flowers burst into bloom, growing up in tropical Singapore totally spoiled me. When I moved to the UK for university, where the growing season I had to work with suddenly shrank from 12 full months a year of peak development to as little as three months for some species, I desperately had to seek out species as horticultural coping strategies to keep me going. Here are some of my very favourite plants that offer flower and fragrance just when you need it most. Over the years, they have been my lifeline through the long, dark winter months.When the rest of the garden starts sliding into winter slumber, the incredibly architectural branches of Mahonia japonica burst forth with big bunches of yellow flowers from their tips. The haunting fragrance of orange blossom fills the air around them, giving you an instant flashback to summer warmth on the frostiest of mornings.For those in milder areas, the exotic ferny foliage of Acacia dealbata (mimosa) does a similar trick of cloaking itself in bright yellow, throwing up clouds of tiny fuzzy baubles, once a key ingredient in fancy French perfumes.Acacia nanodealbata is a dwarf form that will grow happily in a pot in even the smallest spaces. It’s the perfect plant to site by a doorway so that you enjoy the scent it has to offer, and the plant in turn enjoys the extra warmth the brickwork of the house has to offer. A people-plant win-win.We tend not to think about camellias as being scented, but there is a species that has a truly show-stopping perfume: Camellia lutchuensis. The original wild form can be tricky to track down but, fortunately, enterprising plant breeders have used it as a parent plant to create lots of wonderful cultivars that combine scent and colour. I love the delicate flowers of ‘Spring Mist’, whose lightly blushed pink flowers look like something off a painted silk kimono. They also have one of the longest seasons around, churning out flowers from winter to early spring.If you want something more blousy, ‘Fragrant Pink’ gives you masses of bright Barbie-pink double blooms with a fragrance just as understated. Finally, my favourite ‘Cinnamon Candy’ emits wafts of a spicy, Christmassy scent from the most elegant ivory white blooms that look like they could be made from fine porcelain.Pick one of each and you will get such a fragrance hit, along with the visual pleasure of sharp colours to brighten up these gloomy days, that you might not even mind the frosty nights to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd02961eeb01bfd1da77ed4617ee91dec010c532/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b36cc8a9d60f792fdf913af9d362a39","title":"what the woman earning 40k reveals about us eva wiseman","story":"The vitriolic response to women’s money diaries betrays ancient masculine insecuritiesLast week Grazia published an article headlined: “I Earn £40k And Live At Home, But I Still Need My Parents To Bail Me Out Each Month.” A cacophony of clicks ensued, I heard the rush from my desk, the orchestral percussion of a thousand sharpened fingers preparing to type their devastating response, the definitive smackdown of another young woman who doesn’t know she’s bloody born.The Money Diary has become a high-pitched document for our times, a column (the first and most reliably fascinating being on lifestyle site Refinery29 which claims to tackle “the last taboo”) where young women document their expenses over the course of a week, from bikini waxes to acai bowls, and the internet shuffles forward as one to judge them.For something that should be boring – we are doing little more than reading a stranger’s receipts – they are oddly mesmerising in the way they illuminate these anonymous lives, a whole autobiography told through the price an intern pays for a feta and avocado wrap, and confusion over the value of a line of coke.And for every insight they offer about the money diary’s subject, the commenters’ reactions give us 10 more about us, her readers – about our morals, our doubts, our violent reactions to the seemingly mundane, such as the purchase of an extra large latte or an extra small dog.Around 10,000 people upload a portrait and ask Google: “Am I ugly?” each month money diaries are the cash equivalent, a series of women presenting their credit card bills and asking: “Am I a bad person?” To which the regrettable answer, with few exceptions, is usually a noisy: “Oh God, Karen, yes.”Grazia’s offering was no different. “She must have a serious gambling problem,” said one commenter on Twitter. “Irresponsible” “I want to punch her in the throat” “Cocaine is too obvious a money drain… which makes me think she has a much more shameful vice, like buying hordes of creepy dolls she talks to” and “This is why people won’t talk about money…”And here is the thing. Here is the big, vulgar, sweating thing, holding money diaries up with calloused hands and the grunting weight of decades of anxiety. These lists of Uber rides and blow dries and dog food might appear to simply be another pedestal upon which women climb to have rocks thrown at them, often by their peers. Peers who, like them, were born to the lullaby that they could have it all, but grew up in a time when all opportunities for financial security had dissolved like sugar. But the real value of money diaries – and their real allure – is that they are unique in being the only place where women are allowed to talk about money.The money is not the problem – the internalised gender roles (and then, for progressive women, the inevitable guilt about her regressive values, oy) are the problem, and one that contributes both to the gender pay gap and to our shoddy relationship with cash.If money diaries can tell us anything, it’s that the internet, with all its fury and judgment, is not the best place to discuss how much you spend on a cappuccino. But their popularity exposes a real need to talk about money. We should be learning about investments at school, we should be talking about our incomes with our partners to avoid the paycheck standing for something bigger, or triggering ancient masculine insecurities, we should be talking about it at work, piercing that clingfilm that keeps colleagues separate.We should be literate enough in cash that to disclose your salary needn’t feel like exposing your self-worth. Perhaps if talking about money wasn’t such a taboo, the £40k Grazia writer wouldn’t still be asking her parents for pocket money. And, yeah, I’m going to need her receipts.I did it.

Could the answer be to put ourselves out there more? We challenged standup Tessa Coates to find outWhen asked if I’d take on a week of challenges designed to help me open up my life to others, I saw “throw a dinner party” on the list of activities and said yes without reading the fine print. That, friends, is how I found myself running with a gang of overly enthusiastic joggers to an allotment on a dark Monday night, weeding a vegetable patch, and then running back.I wanted to learn something about myself during my week of sharing challenges. Reader, I learned that, while I am too often a cynical husk of a woman, I can be rehabilitated. And if I can, you can.Challenge one was at the Castle Canteen at the Crossway Christian Centre in Elephant and Castle, where volunteers make a free lunch once a week for anyone who wants it, from donated surplus food. Unquestionably a wonderful project, I was absolutely dreading it my catering experience starts and ends at being told off for eating the canapés and being sent home for backchat, while my volunteering experience starts and ends at being told off for not listening during the safety talk – and then being sent home for backchat. I had a heavy heart.To my delight, the Castle Canteen is run by a brilliant lady named Emily, who’s a professional chef. Nobody sent me home and everyone said I did a good job chopping the mange tout. When our lunch guests started to file in, my unsociable side wanted to stay at my chopping board. If I wasn’t there as part of a challenge, I might well have. But I forced myself to go out and find a seat, wondering how to find common ground.“Hello lovely lady, you’re new, what’s your name?” was the immediate greeting. A fantastic woman called Stella had me laughing in minutes, introducing me to a teacher, a musician and an ex-jockey. Conversation flowed, everybody had a story. It pulled at my heartstrings to see people light up with someone to talk to.That evening, I met a group of 30, all running with the social fitness group GoodGym, to help out with a gardening project. You meet for a run, do half an hour’s work, and then run back. The cynic in me was wearing away, fast. Who was I to make sassy comments when there are people out there trying to do something genuinely good?Next, I put a note under my neighbours’ door asking if they’d like to come round for some wine. Not the ones downstairs – we’d had an altercation over a plant pot 18 months ago and no one’s gotten over it – but the ones above. I explained the challenge, which made things less awkward, and next minute they were all round, new baby in tow. Suddenly we’re all laughing at the kitchen table, as if we lived in some kind of Mediterranean utopia.The dinner party, to which I was supposed to invite people from different parts of my life, made me very anxious. I rarely mix friends because I am not a natural hostess, and get so nervous that people won’t have a nice time that I inevitably ensure they don’t. But I swallowed down my whirlwind of nerves, invited friends who’d never met each other, gave them a glass of wine, and listened to them talking while I tried not to burn myself in the kitchen. “Why have we never met before?” they kept shouting at me. Honestly, I don’t know.I’ve realised that it’s easier to roll your eyes at the back than it is to get involved, but not nearly as fun. If we dig deeper, there’s probably something in there about fearing rejection. Regardless, I’m officially taking off my big cynical hat. The neighbours are coming for dinner next week and I might even join GoodGym permanently – you get a free red T-shirt and everything.1 Learn a new skillExpand your horizons by signing up for local night and weekend classes – a quick way to find like-minded people keen to embrace a new challenge.2 Try a supper clubSharing home-cooked food and maybe a bottle of wine with strangers at a dinner party in a secret location is always going to be an interesting experience.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes. It won’t be any worse for it.Best paired with …With its crisp, fresh flavours, white fruit aromas and delicate stream of bubbles, a glass of perfectly chilled Cava Brut Reserva makes an ideal accompaniment to the sharply-sweet flavours of rhubarb charlotte.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

Your support is critical for the long-term sustainability of the .Being supported by readers means that we must focus on the stories that are most meaningful to society: serious reporting that takes time and effort, carefully uncovers the facts, holds the powerful to account, and interrogates ideas and arguments – journalism that speaks to the urgency of the moment, but lasts for more than a day.In the last few years we have experienced a dramatic undermining of the business model for serious journalism, as well as a series of political and social shocks, from the EU referendum result to the election of Donald Trump, and what many believe is an unprecedented level of disruption to our planet, our nation states, our communities, ourselves.The support of our readers has enabled us to pursue quality, investigative journalism which has resulted in huge global scoops such as the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook scandal – uncovered by Carole Cadwalladr, who writes for our sister paper the Observer – and about the use of people’s data in political campaigns. In addition, the Windrush revelations gave a voice to the Commonwealth citizens who have been in the UK for decades but subjected to terrible indignities because they had no paperwork.We have also continued to build on the ’s proud tradition of progressive journalism by increasing our focus on the environment, committing to reporting on inequality, exposing offshore tax avoidance through both the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers, and investigating the behaviour and employment practices of corporations in a globalised world.We believe, through the support of our readers, that we have a profound opportunity to connect with each other and experience – first hand – the stories that are shaping all of our lives, and to collaborate as we work towards a better, more informed future.At the , we are committed to holding the powerful to account and covering stories that would otherwise be ignored, and, we hope, helping to build a fairer world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8531f8a493f3b1a38ac8153db248f690532b30d9/664_424_5312_3187/master/5312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58253ce24727dc5af1ed10e41a146b8b","title":"today in focus guardian daily podcast new host","story":"The host of the ’s new daily podcast and her team aim to inject originality and heart into the news agendaI was on maternity leave when I decided to leave my role as joint political editor to present Today in Focus – the ’s new daily podcast. I was gutted to stop working alongside my amazing job-share, Heather Stewart, but excited to find myself back at our headquarters in King’s Cross.The new team was placed on a bank of desks on the second floor, close to the Observer newsroom, where colleagues I’d worked with for eight years before leaving for the parliamentary lobby in 2009 are still beavering away. On our other side are (usefully!) the lawyers and the sports desk, followed by global development writers, and a strengthened environment team.Then – just two minutes around the corner – is the newsdesk, where the volume rises as editors gather around desks to make quick, collective decisions on rolling stories.Given our aim is to showcase  and Observer journalism by telling its stories in a fresh and engaging way, sitting in the middle of two newsrooms feels like the perfect location. Meanwhile, we can turn to the reporting teams in the US and Australia, foreign correspondents in Europe, Africa and Asia and some of the best opinion writers in the world.As for the podcast itself, our central aim is to provide listeners with 20 minutes every day that never scrimps on storytelling but is anchored in the news agenda.To achieve that, the  has built a team that feels unique: because it brings together radio documentary makers with news junkies like me. That mix of skills and ideas has lent itself to an incredibly creative team in which everyone is learning a huge amount.And I’ve been really pleased with the pieces that combination of strengths has resulted in already – focusing on interesting news ideas, but telling them in a narrative, audio-rich way that we hope to develop over time. The first few episodes have been well received and have already given us good ideas on what works well.The most exciting thing has been quickly realising the scale of the talent we have to draw on here at the . Having covered politics for many years, I already knew there were excellent reporters in domestic policy areas such as the ’s Patrick Butler, an expert on universal credit, and – of course – Heather and her team in Westminster, with whom we have covered the fast-moving story of Brexit. However, I had not worked with foreign correspondents such as Tom Phillips and Bethan McKernan, whose takes on the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and the war in Yemen combined excellent analysis with powerful and emotional stories from the ground.The format has also allowed us to be experimental, whether that means interviews with external figures such as the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, or spending a day racing around Westminster to give a behind-the-scenes feel on a huge day for news.My co-presenter, India Rakusen, has done powerful episodes: one on poverty in Britain and another on the legacy of the Iraq war, for which Peter Beaumont was able to record for the podcast on the ground.The fact that not many others are producing similar content in the UK means that Today in Focus is inevitably a work in progress in every respect, from the subjects we choose and people we interview to the workflow we follow to get the product completed each day.The overall hope is to bring  stories, told by its reporters alongside their writing, to a wider, younger and more erse audience. And our position, at the centre of a values-based organisation whose global voice has been amplified in the face of political shocks such as the elections of Donald Trump and Brexit, make that something I believe we can achieve.Being based in the  means we can be more credible than many of the websites cheerleading for their favoured politicians, but far more spiky than the BBC. Where the Today programme tries to give you headlines, we want to give you heart.We hope to offer a mix of immediate news stories, looked at from fresh angles, alongside deep es into major, rolling stories. Then there is an opinion section, where we will hear from  and Observer regulars as well as other voices from outside the building.For me, it’s a bit of a dream job, isn’t it? I get to sit in a studio day after day, discussing really interesting topics with the best journalists in the world, and working alongside some of the best young producers in the country to find new ways to present them. So far, in pilots and for real episodes, I’ve been discussing everything you can imagine, from Trump to Theresa May, the refugee crisis to Brexit, plastics to cocaine.And I’ve already experienced how differently you get to engage with your audience through a podcast. Along with Heather, I’ve been presenting Politics Weekly for the past two years, and I’ve always loved hearing from listeners who say they feel closer to my reporting when presented in that way.Today in Focus is going to be a bit experimental as we try things out with format, style and tone. In time, we will find the voice that we believe works best for us and as a platform for the . So please: come, try and (I hope) enjoy what we have to offer, but do also pile in with feedback and ideas.If you give us just 20 minutes of your time, we promise you will learn something relevant, interesting and new every day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e7352fe81fe8b94ef38c981dc64f9d36009a868/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d39c669e8b33d811017273d213f959","title":"iceland to india global community map support guardian","story":"Our interactive map shows the countries where  supporters are, and why some decided to help fund our workSince 2015, the number of  supporters has grown to include readers, listeners and viewers from across the world.Thanks to their financial support, we have been able to keep our quality, independent journalism open to everyone, free of charge, wherever they are.Our deep investigative reporting of the Panama Papers and Cambridge Analytica scandals inspired readers to support us.

The cost would have been a prohibitive £12,000, so she signed a deal to lease part of her roof to a solar power company, which would fit the panels for free. It would pocket the newly introduced feed-in tariffs (FITs) – subsidies paid by the government for the electricity generated. She, meanwhile, would have lower energy bills. At the end of the 25 years, the panels and the tariffs would be hers.It seemed a win-win situation until recently, when she needed to sell the house. Her buyer’s mortgage application was refused because of the lease agreement, which had effectively signed over a large part of the roof to the solar company.“A clause in the lease allowed us to buy out the panels for a fee to compensate the company for the loss of their FITs,” she says. “We were prepared to do it to be able to sell our house and move on with our lives, but the company had passed the management of the panels on to an agent, who seemed reluctant to let us proceed.”Eventually, after the Observer intervened, Griffiths was allowed to buy the panels for £20,500, an uncosted sum that she was told was non-negotiable. Not only was this nearly double the price she’d have paid to install the system herself, but she had also missed out on nearly eight years of FITs worth, around £7,300. All in all, the “free” system has left her around £16,000 out of pocket.The government introduced the generous incentives in 2010. The FITs, funded by a levy on all energy bills, have encouraged 800,000 households to go solar, but they have also spawned a multitude of startups that have exploited homeowners.Many are discovering the high price of their “free” deal as they try to sell. The 25-year leases apply to the property regardless of who owns it, and they have to find a buyer willing to take on the remaining years. And even if a buyer is happy, mortgage lenders may not be. The deal is treated as a leasehold, and contracts skewed in favour of the company are deemed risky by banks and building societies.Claire Hunt discovered that her elderly father had signed up to a leased solar installation when his roof began leaking. He had been talked into the 25-year contract in 2011, when FITs were at their peak, and the company has since ceased trading.“We were directed to another company which has apparently taken over the contract, but we’ve been unable to engage with them by phone or in writing,” says Hunt. “It is only because of the leak that I have finally had sight of the contract and I am devastated to find there isn’t even a buyout clause to end it. We are therefore arranging to remove the solar panels ourselves and will put them back when completed. A very expensive fix.”Fiona Baker is similarly trapped after agreeing to leased solar panels in 2010. “I am retired with MS and myotonic dystrophy, and need to sell my house, but the buyer won’t go ahead unless I have the panels removed,” she says. “This is apparently not possible until the lease expires at the end of the 25 years.”Meanwhile, Simon Norris is unable to remortgage because the firm that installed his leased panels appears to have breached building regulations. “The lender wanted a structural survey, which concluded that the roof should have been reinforced before the panels were fitted,” he says.Most lenders will agree a loan on a property with leased solar panels provided the contract meets certain conditions, one of them being that the installing company be accredited, the installation be approved and insured, and panels removable without penalties for missed FIT payments. Crucially, a lender’s permission needs to be obtained if an existing borrower decides to install leased panels.In the race to profit from FITs, many companies ignored these conditions. They also did not inform customers of the full value of subsidies they would be entitled to if they bought the panels outright or the implications for current or future mortgages as required by the Renewable Energy Consumer Code (RECC).Since most of the original companies have ceased trading, it can be difficult for sellers and buyers to find out who owns their panels. Jim Cowan recently bought his house without receiving the contract for the leased panels. He can’t find out who owns them since the installing company no longer exists and may find himself unable to remortgage or sell. Householders in this predicament have to submit a subject access request to energy regulator Ofgem’s FIT register team and provide proof that they are the property owners.Government subsidies on solar panels will cease at the end of next March. Miss the deadline and it would take a working household up to 70 years instead of the current 20 to recoup the average £6,500 cost. Those hoping to install panels should get quotes only from companies listed on the RECC website and request a written estimate of the output from the system and the financial benefits. Anyone buying a house with leased solar panels should ensure the contract complies with the minimum requirements laid down by the Council of Mortgage Lenders.* All names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c677bff4b6851cb6a6b327c953d27b99397c0e2b/1396_0_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03e55254cff8b73cab4358330e588fc6","title":"cbso mirga grazinyte tyla review mieczysaw weinberg","story":"Symphony Hall, BirminghamA weekend dedicated to the composer Mieczysław Weinberg featured the first British performance of his anguished 21st Symphony, dedicated to victims of the Warsaw ghetto With violinist Gidon Kremer (link) as artist-in-residence, it was inevitable that music by Mieczysław Weinberg would feature in the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra’s current season. Kremer has tirelessly championed the works of the Polish-born Soviet composer, and he was the presiding eminence at a weekend devoted to Weinberg’s music, in which the highlight was the first British performance of his last completed symphony, the 21st. The CBSO combined forces with Kremer’s own chamber orchestra Kremerata Baltica for the premiere, which was conducted by Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla, who followed it with the final symphony by Weinberg’s close friend and mentor Shostakovich, his 15th, sounding as elusive and enigmatic as ever in this finely sculpted performance.Completed in 1991, five years before his death, Weinberg’s 21st Symphony is dedicated to the victims of the Warsaw ghetto, and carries the subtitle “Kaddish”. It is not a setting of the Jewish prayer for the dead, but a 55-minute, single-movement elegy in six sections, studded with quotations from Weinberg’s own music and that of other composers. Its language recalls the expressionist Shostakovich of the 1930s. The big opening Largo is threaded through with lamenting violin solos (played here by Kremer) derived from one of Mahler’s Knaben Wunderhorn songs, and interrupted suddenly by a piano quoting the opening melody of Chopin’s G minor Ballade, which becomes a symbol of the suffering of the Polish nation.As Gražinytė-Tyla’s superbly prepared performance so vividly demonstrated, it is a work of enormous power, by turns desolate, anguished and angry. The keening emotions only find consolation in the closing pages, when wordless treble and soprano voices (Freddie Jamison and Maria Makeeva here) call to each other across the orchestra, bringing a touch of humanity to a work that remembers a world without any."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3247e33359eda7227ba5c8fb7b64d0f5eb6111f6/354_1395_4926_2956/master/4926.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=647efbfbeb78bbe5fc29f16bee28e15c","title":"rita ora phoenix review","story":"Such has been Rita Ora’s omnipresence over the past few years, it’s easy to forget that the 27-year-old London singer-songwriter hasn’t released a full-length album since her debut in 2012.

And yet Ora’s pop career is rarely taken seriously, and the title of Phoenix feels pointed. Ora is hardly in need of a rise from the ashes, but if this album seeks to prove that her musical output is still relevant, it just about succeeds.Buoyant and gleaming, Phoenix bubbles with soaring, EDM-lite beats and Ora’s wispy-powerful vocals – albeit with generic lyrics about love and fame. While this is a pleasant, polished dance-pop release, the most intriguing moments come from the collaborations: Keep Talking with Julia Michaels is particularly euphoric, while lyrically misguided ode to bisexuality Girls at least feels distinctive in its production.

The deal was “a necessary step to build the trust between the UK and the EU” to build “an unprecedented and ambitious future partnership”.The EU is keenly aware that the British parliament could reject the deal.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long. After a rapid leadership contest, a different leader could appeal to a majority in parliament, perhaps by offering a softer deal.Tory backbenchers depose herJacob Rees-Mogg gets his way and there is a no-confidence vote. A new leader then tries to assemble a majority behind a tweaked deal.May calls a general electionMay could choose to take the ultimate gamble and hope that voters would back her deal, over the heads of squabbling MPs.Labour tries to force an electionThe opposition tables a vote of no confidence.\u0026nbsp​If May lost​,\u0026nbspthe opposition (or a new Conservative leader) would have two weeks to form an alternative government that could win a second confidence vote. If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.A second referendum gathers supportThis is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u0026nbspNo dealThe EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.Urging British MPs to vote for the deal, he said there was nothing better on offer. “This is the max we can all do. If I would live in the UK I would say yes to this, I would say that this is very much acceptable to the United Kingdom,” he said, because the deal “limited the impacts of Brexit while balancing the vote to leave”.Theresa May “has fought very hard”, he said, and now there was “an acceptable deal on the table”.The prime minister was due to meet the 27 other EU leaders on Sunday morning, after the group sign off the Brexit withdrawal agreement and political declaration.Donald Tusk, the European council president, who convened the meeting, said he was recommending EU leaders approve the outcome. “Although no one will have reasons to be happy on that day, there is one thing I would like to stress: at this critical time, the EU27 has passed the test of unity and solidarity.”He tweeted some lyrics from the Queen singer Freddie Mercury: Arriving at the summit, Lithuania’s president, Dalia Grybauskaitė, said: “We have a summit not with British parliament but we have a summit between us and we are going to agree on the withdrawal agreement and then it will be for Britain to decide what do do next.”EU leaders see the summit as a sombre moment. “There is nothing good for any side because it is withdrawal from the European Union,” added Grybauskaitė.The European parliament also has to give its consent to the deal, which is expected in January, according to its president, Antonio Tajani. “We will vote for the agreement, there is a majority in favour. This is a message to our friends in the British parliament, this is a good agreement for both.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66d203a5ea393df2f17a959f87f61f327079a0b1/0_89_4708_2825/master/4708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec7c87e7e219db9164f59119fc64f14e","title":"dup may back norway style brexit deal says arene foster","story":"Leader calls for ‘third way’, saying her party cannot support Theresa May’s plan The DUP could consider backing a Norway-style deal for Brexit as a way to prevent Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK, Arlene Foster has said, stressing there is no way her party can back Theresa May’s plan as it stands.Speaking immediately after EU leaders gave their formal backing to the proposed deal, Foster was adamant that the party she leads, which supports May in government, could never back the arrangement.Asked on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show if there were any circumstances in which the DUP’s 10 MPs could vote for the deal, Foster replied: “No, there aren’t.”She declined to say whether her party would remove its confidence and supply arrangement keeping May in power if the Brexit deal was passed by the Commons, saying only that she would “review” the issue in this case.“We will have to see what happens at this time,” she said.But Foster said it seemed very unlikely the plan would pass: “As far as I can see there doesn’t seem to be a great deal of enthusiasm in the House of Commons for this deal, quite the contrary. So let’s wait until we get to that vote. I don’t see any circumstances at present where that vote will be a vote to go ahead in Theresa May’s favour.”The DUP’s main objection to the plan is the so-called backstop arrangement, the insurance policy insisted on by the EU to avoid a hard Irish border if no suitable permanent arrangement is found by the time the transition period ends, which would keep Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels regulations.May has argued that there is no plan for this to happen, as the deal would be done in time. But Foster said this made no sense.“It’s a legally binding text. You can’t have it both ways – you can’t say it’s not going to happen so don’t worry, and then on the other hand sell it as the best of both worlds,” she said. “There’s been an inherent contradiction with that argument.”There was, Foster added, “the time now to look for a third way, a different and better way”.According to the Sunday Times, the DUP has been discussing alternative plans with remain-minded cabinet ministers, including Philip Hammond, David Lidington and Amber Rudd.Asked whether the party had been talking to ministers about the idea of a deal based on a model such as Norway’s, in which the UK would join the European Economic Area (EEA) and thus stay aligned to the single market, Foster did not dismiss this.“Well, there are conversations going on right across government,” she said. “I don’t think that will surprise you. We’re taking to everybody across government. We’re talking to people in the remain side, we’re talking to Brexiteers, we’re talking to everyone, as I think you would expect us to do.”Asked if the DUP could live with an EEA-type arrangement, Foster said: “We’ve always been very keen to give the government space to negotiate a deal in terms of Brexit. That’s the way we’ve always operated. But the one thing that we could not have was a difference between us and the rest of the UK in terms of international trade, in terms of customs and in terms of regulation.”Pressed again, Foster said: “I’m not going to be prescriptive with the government. What I am saying to the government is: this deal, this current deal, does not allow us to take back control, certainly not in terms of Northern Ireland – we stay within the European Union structure and we will have no say on those rules. We will have a democratic deficit. We will have to take the rules with no way of influencing those.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d23e4f245f2a8c903b5f0b661fed050f562aa7b9/0_132_5477_3286/master/5477.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c26e118beda5fe668556ccda93e8383b","title":"eu leaders back theresa mays brexit deal in brussels","story":"Summit offers unanimous support while marking ‘moment of deep sadness’• Brexit deal: latest news and reaction - live updatesEU leaders have given their backing to the Brexit deal struck with Theresa May, firing the starting pistol on the prime minister’s race to win parliamentary approval in time for the UK’s withdrawal next March.At an extraordinary summit in Brussels, the bloc’s 27 heads of state and government took a decisive and historic step towards sealing the terms of Britain’s split from Brussels after 45 years of membership.Unanimous support was given to the terms of a voluminous draft withdrawal treaty, covering citizens’ rights, the £39bn orce bill, and the Irish border issue, along with a 26-page political declaration setting out the basis of the future relationship.In a statement, the EU’s leaders stated their intention to build “as close as possible a partnership” with the UK after Brexit, while warning that they would be “permanently seized” in future negotiations by the principle that countries outside the bloc cannot enjoy the same rights as those within.Brussels has already rejected the proposals thrashed out this summer at Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat, to achieve “frictionless trade” in goods after Brexit.Further statements issued on Sunday morning by the 27 EU leaders laid out their intention to maintain the rights of European fleets to fish in British waters.There was a thinly veiled threat to block any transition extension unless a new arrangement with Brussels was swiftly agreed by the government.Arriving at the summit, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, nevertheless advised MPs to vote for the deal on the table, suggesting that a “no” vote could damage negotiations on the future relationship.“Now it is time for everybody to take their responsibilities, everybody,” he said. The deal was “a necessary step to build the trust between the UK and the EU” to build “an unprecedented and ambitious future partnership”.The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said: “I would vote in favour of this deal because this is the best deal possible for Britain.“I’m sad because watching the UK … leaving the EU is not a moment for jubilation but a moment of deep sadness and we make everything possible in order to have this orce being as smooth as possible. but there are no smooth orces.“This is the deal, it’s the best deal possible and the EU will not change its fundamental position when it comes to this issue so I do think the British parliament – because this is a wise parliament – will ratify this deal.”The French president, Emmanuel Macron described it as “not a day to celebrate”, while the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, warned MPs no better deal was on offer from the EU, urging them to back the agreements the May was bringing back to parliament.“If I would live in the UK I would say yes to this, I would say that this is very much acceptable to the United Kingdom,” Rutte said, because the deal “limited the impacts of Brexit while balancing the vote to leave”. In a bid to help the prime minister, he said May had “fought very hard” and now there was “an acceptable deal on the table”.May will hope that the leaders’ endorsement of the terms of the UK’s orce will mark the end of nearly 18 months of arduous negotiations, during which the prime minister has survived cabinet resignations and an attempted coup by Brexiters on her own back-benches.Should the withdrawal agreement be ratified in Westminster and the European parliament, it is further agreed that the UK will stay in the single market and customs union, without representation in any decision-making institutions, for a 21-month-long transition period following withdrawal on the 29 March 2019.An extension of that period of “up to one or two years” is foreseen should the negotiations over the future relationship not be completed by the end of 2020.May must now return to the cut and thrust of parliamentary politics in Westminster, as she battles to convince MPs, including many in her own party, to back her painstakingly negotiated deal in the “meaningful vote”.In her open letter to the British public published on Sunday, May promised to campaign “with my heart and soul to win that vote and to deliver this Brexit deal”.She said the vote would take place in “a few weeks”. Opposition whips expect the government to announce the date this week – with the betting at Westminster on 10 or 11 December, just before the next scheduled meeting of EU leaders in Brussels. There are likely to be upwards of 30 hours of debate in the deeply ided House of Commons, over the course of several days.With more than 80 of the prime minister’s own party having publicly expressed scepticism about the deal, and Labour pledged to oppose it – barring a likely handful of rebels – May faces a formidable challenge in winning the vote. Yet losing it would plunge Britain into what May herself has called, “deep and grave uncertainty”.The EU is keenly aware that the British parliament could reject the deal, but want to show the bloc was able to make an offer to the UK.The agreement had appeared at risk in the days leading up to the summit, when Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, threatened to withhold support unless Britain conceded that the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, over which the Spanish have a long-running territorial claim, would be covered by a future trade deal only with Madrid’s consent.The British ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, gave that commitment in a letter on Saturday afternoon, prompting outrage across the political spectrum by what was described as a “betrayal” of the Rock.Asked how Spain’s threatened “veto” was solved, Lithuania’s president, Dalia Grybauskaitė, said as she arrived at the summit: “Usually there are some tricks, we promise to promise.”EU leaders see the summit as a sombre moment. “There is nothing good for any side because it is withdrawal from the European Union,” Grybauskaitė added.The European parliament also has to give its consent to the deal, which is expected in January, according to its president, Antonio Tajani. “We will vote for the agreement, there is a majority in favour”, he said. “This is a message to our friends in the British parliament: this is a good agreement for both.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3289279be62f89b3010511c5811f54ac253238b/691_304_2184_1311/master/2184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92a1967a070bb61f4c5b5fd5f6c07cea","title":"may brexit deal explained eu withdrawal agreement trade backstop citizens rights","story":"The EU has agreed on May’s 585-page withdrawal agreement. Here are the main issues• Brexit summit - latest news and reaction - live!After 524 days of negotiations, Theresa May and the EU’s other 27 heads of state and government have agreed a deal to be put in front of the UK and European parliaments for ratification ahead of Britain’s withdrawal on 29 March 2019.There is a 585-page withdrawal agreement, which will form the basis of a legally binding treaty, and a 26-page political declaration on the future relationship. The second document does not have legal force, but it politically binds both sides to some basic parameters in the future talks. Here is what has been agreed in Brussels:If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long.

If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.A second referendum gathers supportThis is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u0026nbspNo dealThe EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.The three main issues dealt with in the withdrawal agreement are citizens rights, the £39bn orce deal and the problem of avoiding a border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.The deal safeguards the rights for more than 3 million EU citizens in the UK, and over 1 million UK nationals in EU countries to stay and continue their current activities in the place in which they have made their home. Theresa May had sought to limit the scope of the deal to those who arrived in the UK before 29 March 2019, but she lost out. All those arriving to live in the UK at any point up until the end of the transition period, which could last until the end of 2022 should it be extended, will enjoy the rights that EU nationals have today to make Britain their home, to live, work and study.It had been feared that the UK’s exit bill could scupper the negotiations. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, told the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, early on in the talks that there was nothing in the EU’s treaties to suggest that the British government owed any money. Juncker responded that the EU was “not a golf club”, and that Britain would have to come good on the spending commitments it made as a member state. Huge figures circulated, with some totting up gross liabilities to be £100bn. That prompted the then foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, to suggest Brussels could “go whistle” for its money. An agreement was finally made last November that the UK would stump up about £39bn, to cover its contribution to the EU budget until 2020, and accumulated other outstanding commitments such as pensions for EU officials.This has turned out to be the thorniest issue to settle in the Brexit orce agreement and still causes the most unhappiness among Theresa May’s critics. The UK had initially proposed a technological solution but this was rebuffed by Ireland and EU officials as “magical thinking”. The EU initially proposed that Northern Ireland should in effect stay in the single market and customs union, prompting a furious response from the British prime minister. The EU moved its position. The core of the solution is the so-called backstop, an insurance plan that kicks in if future trade talks fail to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The backstop means the whole of the UK will remain in the EU customs union, while Northern Ireland will have to follow single market rules. Brexit supporters loathe the backstop, fearing it will leave the UK “shackled” to EU rules. Wary EU countries think the plan benefits the UK, so insisted the UK respect EU social and environmental rules to to avoid undercutting their companies.The UK came into the negotiations determined to get a weighty political declaration that would easily translate into a full-blown trade deal ready to come into force soon after Brexit day. The promise of the “easiest trade deal in history” soon hit the buffers. The UK has agreed a joint paper of just 26 pages outlining the parameters of the future relationship, with the two main pillars being trade and security. The paper offers lots of ideas about what might happen, but few concrete plans.The prime minister’s central policy priority in terms of trade was to secure a commitment to frictionless trade in goods through a common rulebook, the centrepiece of the Chequers plan. By stating that the UK and the EU would be “separate markets and distinct legal orders” after Brexit, the political declaration demolished it. British access to European markets will depend on the UK respecting EU standards on competition, tax, environment, as well as social and employment protection, but it is not clear whether that involves non-regression or dynamic alignment. The political declaration says the shared customs territory in the Northern Ireland backstop will be built on and improved in a future trade deal. The UK, bafflingly, insists this does not bind the British government to a customs union. Despite British demands for a bespoke deal on financial services, the UK will be treated like any other non-EU country. Instead of “passports” that allow the City of London to operate across the EU, bankers and traders will have to rely on “equivalence”, allowing market access to be withdrawn by Brussels at 30 days’ notice. There is a commitment to complete equivalence assessments by the middle of June 2020.The UK had hoped to not only maintain the current level of security and police cooperation but to even opt in to aspects of the EU’s structures that it had previously snubbed. That prompted Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, to remark: “They were in with a load of opt-outs. Now they are out, and want a load of opt-ins.” The EU is only offering cooperation, rather than membership, of EU police agency Europol and judicial cooperation agency Eurojust. Despite its previous disdain for EU-level defence cooperation, Britain has negotiated clauses that will allow it to participate in EU joint defence projects. A major row during the Brexit negotiations was the European commission’s insistence that the UK defence industries would not be allowed to work on the most sensitive parts the EU’s £8bn Galileo satellite programme, to which British taxpayers have already paid £1bn. The UK has threatened to walk away and build its own satellite. The political declaration, in an example of its many vague clauses, limits its solution to 10 words. “The parties should consider appropriate arrangements for cooperation on space”, it says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3031a20ad210f3e4feb961d99fe6d4a4d64db85e/2_248_1869_1121/master/1869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42174952f4bd19331fc13819beb32bd2","title":"theresa may not sad but defiant makes case for brexit deal","story":"Prime minister issues direct appeal for backing as EU leaders endorse Brexit dealTheresa May has insisted she is not sad that Britain is leaving the EU, as she made a direct appeal to the public to back her deal, saying: “The British people don’t want to spend any time arguing about Brexit.”The prime minister was speaking after EU leaders met for a special summit in Brussels and formally endorsed her Brexit deal, following a discussion lasting less than an hour.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said Sunday was a “sad day”.But asked if she shared the sentiment, May said, “No: but I recognise that others do I recognise that some European leaders are sad at this moment.”Despite the increasingly bleak prospects for her deal passing the House of Commons next month, in what she called “one of the most significant votes for many years”, May struck a defiant note.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long.

Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.She said she had always rejected the “counsel of despair” from those who believed a beneficial Brexit agreement could not be struck.Despite the fact it is MPs, not voters, who hold her fate in their hands in the coming weeks, she said she wanted to “speak directly to the British people”, and would be embarking on a campaign in the next few days, to sell the deal to the public.The outlines of that campaign were clear as she described the merits of the deal on Sunday, highlighting an end to free movement “once and for all”, halting “vast annual payments” to the EU, and ending the jurisdiction of the European court of justice as the advantages of her deal.She also stressed the government’s keenness to move on to domestic priorities – a view she believes is shared by many voters. “The British people don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit,” she said.May pointedly highlighted the £394m a week her government has promised to pour into the NHS. That pledge, which the prime minister has previously claimed is the result of a “Brexit idend”, echoes the £350m a week the Vote Leave campaign claimed could be erted to the the health service if Britain left the EU.In an open letter on Sunday, May promised to put her “heart and soul” into winning over MPs and voters to the merits of her deal, which she previously said she believed “with every fibre of my being” was the right one.At Sunday’s press conference, she again refused to rule out resigning if the deal was rejected by parliament next month, saying: “It’s not about me.”The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, conceded on Sunday that the odds of the deal passing were “looking challenging” and refused to rule out the risk that the government could collapse if parliament rejected it.He told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “It’s not possible to rule out anything, and that’s why all of us have to do is say, what do your constituents actually want in this situation, and we have to work out what’s in the national interest, and it’s all about the balance of risks. This isn’t a perfect deal for everyone, but does have a lot of what everyone wants.”May echoed the insistence by several EU leaders on Sunday that there was no possibility of reopening negotiations if parliament said no."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab7cbe748703f8a4784ec7b83986b20b43d1dd23/582_284_1974_1185/master/1974.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e774317b6c30dccb53f030e6b6a8afb","title":"brexit eu summit deal theresa may leaders meet for emergency summit to sign off uks withdrawal agreement politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the EU summit in Brussels, where Theresa May and other EU leaders are agreeing the Brexit withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the future relationshipGrassroots for Europe, a network that says it represents more than 100 groups campaigning against Brexit, has delivered a letter to Donald Tusk, president of the European council, asking him not to to anything that would prevent a second referendum, and to make provision for possibly revoking article 50.Richard Wilson, one of its coordinators, from Leeds for Europe, said:Our campaigners know from talking every week to ordinary people on streets and doorsteps that public opinion is changing and people are realising the Brexit deal is nothing like what they were promised or what many of them were persuaded to vote for.We are making sure that our MPs know this, understand that the people’s will has changed, and carry out the people’s majority demand for the right to reject Brexit. With this letter we are taking the same message to the EU in Brussels, to ask, in the mutual interest of all EU citizens, for the time and cooperation to allow UK electors the chance of a democratic rethink.Here is Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, on today’s deal.This is a sad day for everyone involved the deal the EU have endorsed remains a disaster for the British people.What has been agreed is vague at best and is essentially an agreement to have an agreement. There is still no majority in parliament for it, and “no Brexit” remains the only real alternative.Nobody voted to make themselves poorer and damage the UK’s standing in the world. It is time the prime minister granted a people’s vote, with the option to remain in the EU.The BBC’s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has a useful Twitter thread on the message from the summit. It starts here.Responding to the news that the European Union has endorsed the Brexit deal, the Scottish government’s Brexit secretary, Michael Russell, has issued a statement saying May’s Brexit deal “does not work for Scotland”. He says:It takes Scotland out of the European Union against our democratic wishes, it removes us from the single market against our economic interests, and it would put us at a competitive economic disadvantage compared to Northern Ireland. The only thing it guarantees is years of damaging uncertainty.Meanwhile the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is continuing to press the point on fishing rights: in this tweet below she challenges the Scotland secretary, David Mundell, on the link between access to waters and trade, something that the UK government insists will not be ongoing, but which many others looking at the agreement think is inevitable. Here are some highlights from Emmanuel Macron’s press conference. The French president repeated his claim that Brexiters lied during the referendum and he suggested that France would push to keep the UK in the backstop if it does now win concessions on fish. The tweets are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin, the Daily Mail’s David Churchill, the Express’s Joe Barnes, the Times’ Bruno Waterfield and the Sun’s Nick Gutteridge.At a briefing for the Irish media after the summit Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said today’s deal was the only one available. He said:Let’s not forget what we have here. We have an agreement that took between 18 months and two years to negotiate, it is in several parts, is over 500 pages long and as of today has the support of 28 governments.Anyone can have a better deal or an alternative deal in their own minds but an agreement 500 pages long that 28 member states can sign up to nobody has that. What’s on the table is the only deal that’s on the table.He also said the “entire European Union” was of the view that the deal could not be renegotiated. What’s being put in front of EU parliament and House of Commons is a deal. Any other deal really only exists in people’s imagination.Asked whether EU leaders had discussed what they would do if the vote in the House of Commons failed, Varadkar said the EU 27 had made a “conscious decision” not to discuss what may happen in such a scenario.Here is Jeremy Corbyn on today’s Brexit deal.This is a bad deal for the country. It is the result of a miserable failure of negotiation that leaves us with the worst of all worlds. It gives us less say over our future, and puts jobs and living standards at risk.That is why Labour will oppose this deal in parliament. We will work with others to block a no-deal outcome, and ensure that Labour’s alternative plan for a sensible deal to bring the country together is on the table. That includes a permanent customs union with a UK say, a strong single-market deal and guarantees on workers’ rights, consumer and environmental protections.Here are the main points from Theresa May’s press conference:Before Christmas, MPs will vote on this deal. It will be one of the most significant votes that parliament has held for many years. On it will depend whether we move forward together to a brighter future or open the door to yet more ision and uncertainty.But May refused to endorse what Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said this morning about a “no” vote possibly leading to the collapse of the government. (See 11.08am.) Asked about this, she said she was focused on getting the deal through – a line she used repeatedly.If people think somehow there is another negotiation to be done, that’s not the case. This is the deal. It is the result of what have been tough and difficult negotiations over a significant period of time.Cabinet ministers and EU diplomats are secretly drawing up “plan B” proposals for Brexit based on a growing assumption that Theresa May’s deal will be blocked by parliament.Senior figures on both side of the channel are urgently plotting alternatives to the agreement struck by the prime minister after 91 Conservative MPs indicated that they would oppose it in the Commons ...Sources said several senior ministers were talking up one “plan B” idea of a Norway-style relationship with Brussels, under which the UK would have a more certain “exit mechanism” from the EU’s rules but would be unable to end the free movement of workers from the continent.Under the Norway option, the UK would remain a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), without full EU membership. When asked if she would categorically rule out this option, May implied that she would – without saying so explicitly. She said she was clear that she had negotiated the best deal available.The people voted for Brexit. It’s, in a sense, a duty for their politicians, who asked them to make that choice, to then deliver on that choice. This is a deal that delivers on that because what people want to see is an end to free movement.If the UK were to stay in the single market – the Norway option – free movement would continue.There should not be that second referendum. The public would expect parliament to vote on the deal. For most people in the UK they want a deal done and want us to get on with focusing more clearly on the issues that matter to them day to day. No, but I recognise that others do. I recognise some European leaders are sad at this moment, but also some European people in the UK will be sad at this moment.Q: Has anything changed today that might make people back the deal? And what will you say to MPs to persuade them to vote for you?May says the country has a duty to deliver on Brexit. This deal does that, while protecting jobs and security. It is a deal that is good for the whole of the UK, she says.And that is it. The press conference is over. I will post a summary soon.Q: Some MPs are pushing for the Norway option as a fallback. Would you rule that out under your premiership?May says it is important to deliver on what people voted for in the referendum, including an end to free movement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d84fb2e270efaed17fe1cbe73da2e7c1072b2682/8_203_5399_3239/master/5399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c56355d352a123ab7efa2047db08ec7f","title":"boris bedazzles dup with brexit balm on a cold belfast night","story":"Former foreign secretary offers succour and solidarity in one-night show over the Irish SeaIf you lose friends and alienate people and feel somewhat lonely here’s a bold remedy: call Boris Johnson.He can empathise, for a start, since he’s undergoing the same process in the Conservative party. And he can comfort and entertain, bedazzle with words and jokes and defiance.The former foreign secretary did not disappoint the Democratic Unionist party at its annual party conference in Belfast on Saturday.The party feels besieged and betrayed, with the Brexit dream turning into a nightmare, but Johnson offered succour and solidarity in this one-night only performance across the Irish Sea.“Without you it is likely that the mighty engine of the UK economy would have stuttered and stalled. And indeed if it was not for you then there is a risk that the union itself would have been placed in jeopardy.”The words were balm. Here, at least, was one friend in a world turned cold.A scandal over renewable energy and Northern Ireland’s collapsed power-sharing executive have alienated some core supporters. Most Northern Ireland voters voted to stay in the EU. Usually quiescent farming and business leaders loudly defy the party over the Brexit deal.The DUP thought Theresa May was in its pocket until the backstop made her a Quisling. Brussels plots against them, Dublin rubs its hands and now even some arch Brexiteers say the UK would be better off staying in the EU.So here was Johnson to steel nerves and restore the faith. It was a strange type of reassurance.“This deal risks yet further economic and political humiliation,” he said. “We are locking ourselves in by treaty and making it impossible to negotiate our way out.”“We would have to leave Northern Ireland behind as an economic semi-colony of the EU and we would be damaging the fabric of the union.”“Unless we junk this backstop, we will find that Brussels has got us exactly where they want us – a satellite state.”They hooted and stamped.“You can see that we are witnessing the birth of a new country called Ukni. Ukni is no longer exclusively ruled by London or Stormont. Ukni is in large part to be ruled by Brussels.”Visions of Armageddon greeted with masochistic glee because it meant they were not mad, not alone. Someone else agreed with them that the backstop was indeed an existential threat and that no deal was a better option, give or take economic calamity.It did not matter that Johnson has himself lost friends and influence since quitting the cabinet. “He reminds me of Trump,” said Ann Storey, 64, a cafe owner and longtime DUP member. The comparison was a compliment. “It’s the hair and the attitude.”Margaret Lang, 74, a retired Marks \u0026amp Spencer worker, appreciated Johnson’s support: “The DUP is fighting hard. They’re good people and know what they’re doing. It’s good to have Boris. He’s entertaining.”Her friend Sylvia Johnston, 82, agreed: “He’s a very interesting man, though he talks very quickly.”She wasn’t wrong. In between visions of the glories that await, should Britain stare down Brussels and do a proper Brexit, Johnson wove in bendy buses, Star Wars, light sabers, Van Morrison, Hugo Chavez, the Titanic and repeated a call to build a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland. He earned a standing ovation.There were some dissenters. “Today’s highlight? The lemon meringue dessert,” said one member. A half-joke because she too seemed optimistic that somehow Brexit, and the DUP’s parlous position, would end well.William Walker, a councillor from Newry, agreed. “A good vibe today.”You could feel it in the panel discussion titled “sharing the prosperity: a regional approach to inclusive growth in the UK”, with upbeat scenarios about a coming golden age of Brexit.

But, anybody jetting out of Abu Dhabi or Dubai tonight are allegedly in for a bumpy ride.Lap 4355: Bottas is relishing that set of fresh tyres, setting a new fastest lap after a troublesome time. Fernando Alonso, on his F1 swansong, is down in 13th. Lap 4255: Hamilton leads Vettel by 5.1secs, but the Mercedes is unlikely to have it easy in the final stages in Abu Dhabi. The pace of Verstappen and Ricciardo will worry Toto Wolff and co down in the Mercedes paddock. “We pitted because we saw something with the right rear,” confirm Mercedes to Bottas.Lap 4055: Mercedes welcome Bottas into the pits. On go the purple ultrasoft tyres. Can he do any damage with a fresh set?Lap 3955: And now Bottas cannot fend off the other Red Bull, as Daniel Ricciardo nips ahead of the Mercedes before accelerating through the final sector. The two Red Bulls have solid tyres, a promising pace and are within 12secs of the lead.Lap 3855: A 13-second blanket covers the top five, but Bottas is flailing after losing third. Verstappen fancies his chances, squeezing the Mercedes out and bullying him off the track. “He didn’t see me,” Verstappen says, basking in that ice-cool overtake. Brilliant, buoyant driving by the Red Bull who bypasses him and now has set his sights on Sebastian Vettel.Lap 3655: Bottas twice locks up down the back straight. A couple of sloppy mistakes. Vettel’s 1.6secs in front of the Finn. Ricciardo is enjoying himself, with little traffic to worry about. The Australian will be joining the third-placed party soon on this pace. Lap 3555: Hamilton, back out in front, leads Vettel by just over 7secs. Ocon is handed a five-second time penalty by the stewards, for leaving the track and gaining advantage when trumping Vandoorne into 11th.Lap 3455: In comes the race leader Ricciardo. It’s a neat pit-stop, with supersofts slapped on as Ricciardo is whisked in and out inside 2.2secs. The Red Bull returns to the track in fifth, behind team-mate Max Verstappen. The chase is on. Lap 3255: The battle for 11th is hotting up, with Hartley and Gasly keen to get involved in the antics. Ocon holds position for now, with Vandoorne 0.038 secs behind. And now Bottas trumps Verstappen to record another fastest lap inside 1.43. Alonso, meanwhile, is no longer running in last after slinking his way past Sergey Sirotkin. To make matters worse, the Russian is yet to stop for fresh tyres it could be a very long afternoon, so to speak. Lap 3155: Ricciardo leads Hamilton by 2.7secs. And now Max Verstappen has just a new fastest lap, a lightning 1.43. Vandoorne slides in front of Ocon to snatch 11th, while Romain Grosjean has his eyes fixated on the Force India.Lap 2855: Alonso pits. His final F1 pit stop? “It’s a goodbye for now,” he said with a hint of mystery, before the off in Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile, Max Verstappen is moaning down the team radio of a slippery surface owing to that rain. Elsewhere, a streak of lightning has been reported from the helicopter up above.Lap 2755: Nico Hülkenberg has been into the Renault paddock, thanking his team for their help after that first-lap clash. He looks well, waving to fans who spot him peering through the race wall by the start line. Out in front, Ricciardo, yet to pit, leads Hamilton by almost 3secs. Bottas is third. Vettel fourth.Lap 2655: Ericsson is in trouble, his car crawling round the track and down to the pits. His final race for Sauber ends in mechanical failure, and tears. Seventeen drivers remain ...Lap 2555: Red Bull appear to be readying to receive Ricciardo down in the pits. The rest of the top five have pitted, including Lewis Hamilton. Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, has had a good look at how that rain is affecting the track. “It’s raining on the back straight,” says Verstappen. Lap 2355: We have a dusting of rain in Abu Dhabi. Ricciardo is still on the ultrasoft tyres, almost everybody else is on the supersofts. Lap 2155: “How are your tyres, Daniel?” ask Red Bull. “Yep, fairly consistent,” comes the riposte from Ricciardo. “I can hold this.” Once he pits, we will surely have a new-look podium, but the Red Bulls are certainly both well-placed. A look to the gloomy skies tells you all you need to know: rain is on its way.Lap 1955: “Keep pushing up, you know the plan now,” Red Bull tell Ricciardo. The Australian seems very focused in the pod. “Yep,” he says. Ricciardo is the race leader – for now – with Hamilton six seconds behind him. A quick look at how things stand:Lap 1855: A seamless stop by Max Verstappen, with the Red Bull stationary for a mere two seconds. The Red Bull comes out in fifth, behind Sebastian Vettel who has just set a new fastest lap of 1.43.602. Plenty to play for yet. Lap 1755: Anything you can do, I can do better, says Bottas. The Mercedes zips in and out of the pits inside 2.5secs and the Finn returns to the track in fourth, behind his team-mate Lewis Hamilton. But, crucially, he’s in front of Vettel, who has stormed into fifth, beyond the Force Indias, Ocon and Pérez.Lap 1655: Vettel pits, but it’s a little sluggish. Verstappen soars to third and the Ferrari feeds into sixth behind Sebastian Ocon. He is unlikely to be trailing the Force India for long, though. Things are looking promising for Red Bull at Yas Marina.Lap 1455: Sainz steals back eighth from Ericsson, who is beginning to show signs of struggle on those supersoft tyres of his. Out in front, Bottas leads Vettel by 2.7secs, with Hamilton 9.5secs behind the race leader. In third, it’s Daniel Ricciardo, who has Max Verstappen hot on his heels, 1.2secs behind him.Lap 1355: Ericsson leaps into eighth, ahead of Sainz. And an update on Hülkenberg. The Renault driver, while shaken up, has no obvious injuries and instead will continue to be observed at the FIA medical centre in Abu Dhabi. Great news. Lap 1155: Grosjean, who was involved in that early kerfuffle with Nico Hülkenberg, gets past Sirotkin to claim 16th. There is no concrete update on Hülkenberg but he was able to clamber out of the Renault, walking and talking en route to the medical centre, so that’s good news. Räikkönen, who started from fourth, was also forced into a premature retirement after a power failure. Lap 955: “Just remember, Lewis, you are going to the end now,” is the message from Mercedes down the team radio. A one-stop strategy for the world champion, then. Hamilton’s only nine seconds off the lead, despite having pitted. He zooms in front of Verstappen, but the Red Bull fights back to take back fourth. And now the Dutchman scampers off into the horizon. Verstappen, on hypersoft tyres, is very much back in this race after a dreadful start. Lap 855: Lewis Hamilton opts to pit early, and Will Smith applauds as the Mercedes get things sorted inside a rather nifty 2.5secs. Räikkönen, meanwhile, is trudging back towards the paddock on his 150th start for Ferrari. The Finn finishes on a bum note for the Scuderia. The marshals are trying to slide his car through the gate, to minimise the impact on the rest of this race. For now, Valtteri Bottas is the new race leader. Vettel’s second, in front of Daniel Ricciardo, and there’s Max Verstappen, who’s soared up to fourth.Lap 755: Hang on a minute ... Kimi Räikkönen’s race is over. And the virtual safety car is deployed, with the Ferrari stuck in a dangerous position on the grid. “What’s happening? I don’t have power,” he says. His season has come to an abrupt end.Lap 655: Ocon and Verstappen continue to joust, with the Red Bull bypassing the Force India before the Dutchman zooms in front down the inside lane. Things are getting spicy between those two, with their respective cars kissing into the corner. Lap 555: Ocon v Verstappen round two is already proving entertaining fare. The Red Bull seemed to lose power down the straight, but he manages to nip in ahead of Pérez. Ocon, the other Force India, remains in front of him. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton sets an early fastest lap, a pacy 1.43.982. Lap 455: The safety car remains out in front, with Hamilton behind. We will have a green flag and a race restart shortly. The main thing is that Nico Hülkenberg seemed to be OK. Lap 255: Hülkenberg climbs out of his Renault, after a very worrying accident. He gives the thumbs up to those in close proximity, he’s OK, thankfully. It was a clash with Grosjean, in the German’s blind spot. It appeared a relatively low-key coming together between the two, a clipping of the tyres fuelling that crash. Hülkenberg gets into the medical car, and he will be taken to the medical centre. The stewards take a look at the incident, but they’re as happy as they can be. No further action needed. Meanwhile, a front-wing change for Brandon Hartley, who takes an opportunity to repair some damage to his Toro Rosso.Lap 155: Hülkenberg crashes out! His car is on fire, but the German is speaking down the team radio. He seems to be OK. The marshals are hosing his car with the fire extinguishers. His Renault is upside down. A safety car has been deployed. Lewis Hamilton gets away nicely, but a poor start for Max Verstappen, who plummets to 10th, and Fernando Alonso. A good luck message to the Spaniard from the McLaren race engineer on the formation lap quickly goes to waste ...We’ve just had a hearty rendition of the United Arab Emirates’s national anthem. The grid is absolutely swamped, with lights out fast approaching. Lewis Hamilton seems to have a minor issue, but the engineers are relaxed having hoisted one side of the Mercedes up. They think it’s just a small technical fault with a rogue data logger. No problem, then. As for Alonso, bidding F1 a fond farewell, he says: “I will try to take care a little more. I would like not to have a stupid accident in the first couple of corners.”Max Verstappen is fed up of taking flak for that shove on Sebastian Ocon, with the Dutchman attempting to downgrade his behaviour to trivial. “Pushing, in any sport, it happens,” the Red Bull driver says. “I actually saw it a few days ago in football again. So from my side, I thought it was quite a calm response.” The 21-year-old said he only reacted the way he did because of a few verbals courtesy of the Force India. “You don’t hear what is said, you just see me pushing. I was after an apology and I got a bit of a different response.” Hamilton’s paddock, meanwhile, is a jovial affair given Will Smith is a guest of the Mercedes driver at Yas Marina. “He’s granted the old man a wish,” the actor said.Away from Alonso, Lewis Hamilton is determined to finish the season with a bang, having previously been accused of losing focus after sealing the title. This year is the first he has won a race after wrapping up the championship in Mexico City. With overtaking in Abu Dhabi tricky, Hamilton, from pole, is perfectly placed to close a fine year with his 11th victory of the season. “I don’t think it was because I couldn’t do it in the past, I just didn’t do the job,” Hamilton says. “I think this year it was being in a different place in my life. I do want to continue to push the limits, push the boundaries, and I want to finish the season on a solid high if I can so that I can really continue to keep that foundation as strong as it has been this year, so I can use that to start on next year.”This is the last hurrah, the final chunk of the procession as the curtain comes down on another extraordinary season. Things finish as they started, with Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes sat on pole, though the world champion was ultimately upstaged by Sebastian Vettel on the first day of the race calendar. It is two weeks since Hamilton snatched victory in Brazil owing to Max Verstappen’s clash with back marker Sebastian Ocon, which was soured by a shove in the paddock. But as Hamilton bows out after a championship-winning season for him and his team, this will prove a different kind of farewell for Fernando Alonso. The Spaniard’s car has been painted in a colourful one-off livery, including a nod to his region of Asturias, and the two-time champion will also be wearing a special helmet to mark the occasion. The drivers will provide a fitting guard of honour as Alonso heads to the grid for one last time. All in all, it’s sure to be an emotional few hours in Abu Dhabi.

Thanks for your company and comments - later. Right then, here’s Vic Marks’ report of the day. “It’s maybe churlish to mention this given the match and series situation,” emails Geoff Wignall, “but while there are a few good reasons to remain dubious about Root’s captaincy his treatment of Rashid surely ranks as high as any. If Buttler had been in the side when Cook resigned the captaincy, it’s hard to imagine they’d have looked beyond him.”I don’t know - I mean, I know what you mean, but it’s hard to argue with Root captaincy in this series. Just this evening, Moeen got two wickets, he brought Leach on and he got a wicket in his first over, and then the Stokes plan worked. You could run the line that Root doesn’t necessarily have the feel for the game that Buttler does, but I think we can see him getting better, and his batting is also getting towards where it should be. Bumble notes that Lakmal, the Sri Lanka captain, is batting 10, bowling two overs, and fielding at long on. Root, by contrast, is all over it all the time - and he also notes that Stokes sprinted to the fence to save three runs off his own bowling. He says he takes a deep breath when he’s out as a way of trying to make peace with it.Jos Buttler’s voice is the opposite of his batting, and he’s very pleased. He says her was trying to wrestle back momentum when he came out, trying to be busy and knock the bowlers off their lengths. Ian Ward asks why, in Kandy, he used the sweep and here he used his feet. He says that they were watching a Michael Clarke innings on Cricket Classics and Anderson commented that he always used his feet and Swann couldn’t bowl at him he thought it sounded good, so decided to try it. What a ludicrous genius.“Always nice to be reminded of Andrew Hilditch, the Happy Hooker,” emails Adam Hirst.That Mathews hook, then: was his mind frazzled? Was it bravado? Or a calculated effort to counter-attack? Thing is, if you don’t play the shot it doesn’t get you out, and realistically, how many runs is it getting you? How much pressure can you put onto a side 2-0 up in the series and in charge in the middle? It’s hard to make a case for him. That partnership between Stokes and Buttler nailed this match for England - you’d probably still have backed them without it, but with it, fogedaboudid. That’s the beauty of this side, and the ODI lot - at least one of the batsmen will always get you. And that’s the day. The umpires take the players off with four overs remaining Sri Lanka need 274 to win, with six second-innings wickets intact. Good luck, lads. 17th over: Sri Lanka 53-4 (Mendis 15, Sandakan 1) Athers says that Root and Stokes set Mathews a trap but I don’t even know if you can call it that because there was nothing surreptitious about it whatsoever perhaps that was why it was in fact surreptitious, so obvious it wasn’t obvious because he knew how obvious it was. “Trick or deceive (someone) into doing something contrary to their interests or intentions,” says the dictionary I’m not sure. But I am sure that England are going to win this Test and complete the whitewash. Sandakan is in as nightwatchman, and Stokes is off a shorter run as the ran comes down harder again he’s stroked for four, despite Stokes’ best efforts - somehow, it’s he who chases it down to the boundary, just failing with his rescue e ... no he doesn’t. They run one, and what a brilliant effort that was. We go upstairs to check the catch - what, are we saying that Broad can’t be trusted? - and it’s good. Oh Angelo, what are you doing! Stokes goes short and he can’t help but hook, the absolute “....” Broad, running in, takes a belter, ing to his right. He is as pleased with himself as Mr Kipling is with his cakes. 16th over: Sri Lanka 51-3 (Mendis 15, Mathews 4) Moeen is off the field so Leach takes the ball - I wonder what Rashid thinks of that - and Anderson comes on for a spot of fielding. Mathews cuts to point and they run one, then Mendis raises the fifty with two backward of square on the on side. “Further to the ever so OBO etymology discussion on swearage,” emails Dr Ian Copestake, “‘cocknob’ was less to do with belonging to the Orthodox Church and more specifically about certain dualist heresies that were seen as related to Bongoism, which originated in the mind. Specifically, in Western Europe, the southern French effers who took up Vegan-baiting were sometimes called ‘twots’ or ‘kants’ (in the south). That might give us a plausible start date for the term ‘cocknobbery’, since swearing appears in France in the late 12thearly 13th century.”These days, “twot” is one of the very worst Americanisms.15th over: Sri Lanka 48-3 (Mendis 13, Mathews 4) Stokes is back for second turn, though it’s grey out there - figuratively speaking, though it’s also grey in norf London. Maiden. 14th over: Sri Lanka 48-3 (Mendis 13, Mathews 4) It’s raining pretty hard now - I wonder if that might be it for Stokes, because the light isn’t great and the surface is offering a bit more pace and lift. Mathews takes one to long on then, from the final ball of the over, Mendis adds another to midwicket. 13th over: Sri Lanka 46-3 (Mendis 12 Mathews 3) I love Ben Stokes, but at what point do we disapprove of how brazenly he insults the bald community. Ben, they’d love to welcome you formally. Anyway, he has the ball and will look to get it about Mendis’ phizog, but yerman gets down the non-strikers’ sharpish. A short one still follows, Mathews ducking, before hooking three all very well, but that’ll do for him sooner or later if he keeps at it. Stokes then bounces Mendis, who waves the bat above his head and edges four before driving four more. 12 off the over. 12th over: Sri Lanka 34-3 (Mendis 3, Mathews 0) Wicket maiden, and Sri Lanka’s most reliable batsman gone. They might have to take the L here. Review that one! Moeen gets one to dip, Karunaratne plays for the turn that doesn’t come, and he’s bowled through the gate, spit and shine. That’s the sixth overturned of the day. Hardly even worth typing this - Karunaratne knows he’s bottom-edged his sweep and smiles as he gives Mendis dap. 11th over: Sri Lanka 33-2 (Karunaratne 22, Mendis 3) This has been a good spell from Leach, and Russell Arnold suggests he’s backed with a gully - he reckons Moeen should be moved from deep midwicket. But then, after Mendis takes one, Leach drops short and Karunaratne shmices him for four to square leg. Three singles follows, and that’s eight off the over. Just 294 more needed. 10th over: Sri Lanka 26-2 (Karunaratne 17, Mendis 1) Ian Ward reckons it’s raining on one half of the ground and not the other, but it is a bit harder now. Karunaratne takes Moeen’s first ball for one to midwicket, then Mendis pulls one more to deep backward square. 9th over: Sri Lanka 24-2 (Karunaratne 16, Mendis 0) Light rain as Mendis comes out. He’s got a dicky shoulder and has struggled all series against Leach, so this is exactly the kind fo challenge for which he’ll be desperate. It’s still raining, but the sun is also out, as Mendis sees away three balls. Gosh, it’s not going so well for the umpires dem. This one straightens and is banging top-middle of leg England are surely going to win by a conservatoryload. 9th over: Sri Lanka 24-1 (Karunaratne 16, De Silva 0) Thunder and a rainbow in the distance as Leach takes over from Broad. I know there are solid reasons for introducing him and Ali before Rashid, but it’d be nice to see a leggy with a hard ball - it still seems like Root doesn’t really trust him. Anyway, Leach slides one back in at De Silva, and Foakes really likes it, even when the umpire says no, so upstairs we go....8th over: Sri Lanka 23-1 (Karunaratne 15, De Silva 0) There’s lightning and thunder around, apparently, but the sun is peeping through again, so play doesn’t look in imminent danger. Back in the middle, Moeen clips a foothole and the ball sits up, so Karunaratne stretches to whack four through cover. A single follows. 7th over: Sri Lanka 18-1 (Karunaratne 10, De Silva 0) Karunaratne times two away to midwicket as Broad tanks in what a competitor he is. I bet he even wants to win at tiddlywinks - or any other counter-based pastime, such as Ludo and Connect 4. He decides to go around again, Karunaratne taking one to midwicket, before De Silva defends three dots. 6th over: Sri Lanka 15-1 (Karunaratne 6, De Silva 0) A few spots of rain as Moeen bowls the final ball of his over, but it’s not that dark. This is a fine ball from Moeen. Most of his balls this innings have skidded on, but this one bounces, Gunathilaka can’t help but edge, and Stokes, at slip, is never dropping that. 5th over: Sri Lanka 14-0 (Gunathilaka 6, Karunaratne 6) We see the flags, and it’s exceedingly windy now that won’t bother England’s bowlers, especially with the light fading - they’ll be wanting some quick changes to get as many overs in as possible before they go off. After three dots, Broad, who’s finding a groove, goes around to Karunaratne, but his first two goes are leg side - naturally, it’s the ball’s fault, so a word is had with the umpire. Nothing comes of it, but he finds a better line thereafter, and a false shot squirts the ball to point and they take a single. Sky show us a table containing the highest successful chases at Colombo - there’s a 326, v Zimbabwe in 1998, but next is 172. Sri Lanka have a problem. 4th over: Sri Lanka 13-0 (Gunathilaka 6, Karunaratne 5) Ground staff move into position - “we might be getting some weather,” offers Bumble. Karunaratne edges a single to third man, then Moeen tempts Guanthilaka into a false shot with a flighted dipper of a full toss - the ball squirts away to safety. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 12-0 (Gunathilaka 6, Karunaratne 4) There’s a short recess prior to the over, for scattering of sawdust. Then, after two dots, Broad lands one on the button - just back of a length and moving away. Gunathilaka doesn’t play, then takes two to midwicket. “I will tread carefully,” emails Hugh Maguire, “but Falkirk probably has a nationally perceived similar level of charm as Fife. Perhaps its location as neither Edinburgh nor Glasgow suggests a purgatory rather than final destination as with Freuchie. your perspective of which way from Falkirk leads to St. Peter and which to Beelzebub depends on from where you are sending someone. Falkirk 0-0 Fife.”That’s that cleared up then. I have been to both Largs and Paisley. Largs, in particular, is a very special place. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 10-0 (Gunathilaka 4, Karunaratne 4) It’s Moeen from the other end and his first ball catches Gunathilaka on the crease there’s an appeal, but that was going down. He then gets down the other end with a single and Karunaratne steps into a full toss, clumping four to long off. 1st over: Sri Lanka 5-0 (Gunathilaka 3, Karunaratne 0) Broad has the ball and wears his best mean face, then harmisons a wide that’s somewhere towards Falkirk. And, well, oh dear, there’s another, but Foakes’ e saves him the shame of seeing it go to slip. Next ball, though, is a jaffa, pitching and moving away - Gunathilaka is tempted into a push but it’s too good for him. He doesn’t mind, though, driving the eighth ball of the over for three. Apologies, I appear to have started a kids TV riff - don’t talk to me at a party. But let’s mark it down as public service broadcasting for those with kids or, indeed, those without, in which vein, here’s Greg Eden:“No one’s mentioned ‘Adventure Time’. For inventiveness, sass, empowered female characters and surreality, it rinses anything from the 70s or 80s. Sorry to pop your He-Man bubble, I rewatched one yesterday with my 12yo daughter who likes the rebooted She-Ra. It’s not aged well, though works as powerful cringe TV. Anyway ‘Ulysses 31’ won 80s TV cartoons as we all know.”Great theme tune, not sure about the rest, Nono the robot especially. Right then, eyes down for a fascinating mini-session...Sri Lanka have, I think, 21 overs to bat tonight, but the likelihood is that the light will intervene prior to then. 327 is just about low enough for the batsmen to convince themselves that it possible - it’s equal with the highest-ever chase on this ground - one big partnership and it could be close. That’s 100 test wickets for Perera, a mark he reaches quicker than Murali, and gives the bowler his fifer. Leach presses forward, the ball spins off his edge, and Sri Lanka need 327 to avoid a whitewash. 70th over: England 230-9 (Foakes 36, Leach 0) Mendis goes off to get some ice, and Foakes glides Perera for two to cover. Two more follow to midwicket, and then comes the single. “As any ancient physician will tell, a well applied and clinging Leach is a marvellous restorative,” emails Phil Withall. I’d love not to have known that, but someone at my school decided that the history of medicine was a goOd thing to do for History GCSE.

It is claimed they include confidential emails between senior executives, and correspondence with Zuckerberg.Damian Collins, the chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, invoked a rare parliamentary mechanism to compel the founder of a US software company, Six4Three, to hand over the documents during a business trip to London. In another exceptional move, parliament sent a serjeant at arms to his hotel with a final warning and a two-hour deadline to comply with its order. When the software firm founder failed to do so, it’s understood he was escorted to parliament. He was told he risked fines and even imprisonment if he didn’t hand over the documents.“We are in uncharted territory,” said Collins, who also chairs an inquiry into fake news. “This is an unprecedented move but it’s an unprecedented situation. We’ve failed to get answers from Facebook and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest.”The seizure is the latest move in a bitter battle between the British parliament and the social media giant. The struggle to hold Facebook to account has raised concerns about limits of British authority over international companies that now play a key role in the democratic process.Facebook, which has lost more than $100bn in value since March when the Observer exposed how Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from 87m US users, faces another potential PR crisis. It is believed the documents will lay out how user data decisions were made in the years before the Cambridge Analytica breach, including what Zuckerberg and senior executives knew.MPs leading the inquiry into fake news have repeatedly tried to summon Zuckerberg to explain the company’s actions. He has repeatedly refused. Collins said this reluctance to testify, plus misleading testimony from an executive at a hearing in February, had forced MPs to explore other options for gathering information about Facebook operations.“We have very serious questions for Facebook. It misled us about Russian involvement on the platform. And it has not answered our questions about who knew what, when with regards to the Cambridge Analytica scandal,” he said.“We have followed this court case in America and we believed these documents contained answers to some of the questions we have been seeking about the use of data, especially by external developers.”The documents seized were obtained during a legal discovery process by Six4Three. It took action against the social media giant after investing $250,000 in an app. Six4Three alleges the cache shows Facebook was not only aware of the implications of its privacy policy, but actively exploited them, intentionally creating andeffectively flagging up the loophole that Cambridge Analytica used to collect data. That raised the interest of Collins and his committee.A Facebook spokesperson said that Six4Three’s “claims have no merit, and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously”.The files are subject to an order of a Californian superior court, so cannot be shared or made public, at risk of being found in contempt of court.

The Mate 20 Pro packs more cutting-edge technology into it than any other, but unlike most bleeding-edge devices it makes for a great experience.It looks like an iPhone XS mated with a Samsung Galaxy Note 9, with a huge curved 6.39in OLED display and big notch in the top. The screen is great and hides a good pressure-sensitive in-display fingerprint scanner. The curved sides and narrow width makes the massive screen manageable. The top notch hides the 3D face recognition system that uses the same technology as Apple’s Face ID.If that wasn’t enough, there’s a brilliant triple-camera system on the back that gives you up to 5x hybrid zoom and all the way down to 0.6x for wide-angle photos, which make instant panoramas. The front-facing selfie camera isn’t bad either.Performance is top-notch, while battery life is near double the competition. There’s wireless charging in the back, which can even wirelessly charge other devices at the flick of a switch. The 40W cable charger is superfast, too.Huawei’s EMUI isn’t the best Android experience available, but it’s much improved on older versions. The glass back can even have a vinyl-like texture to it, which makes it less slippery and repels fingerprints.Verdict: The best phone of the year isn’t cheap, but offers a brilliant, cutting-edge experience that lasts ages between charges.The oldest phone here, released a month before the rest, Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 is a different beast.It’s got a stunning 6.4in OLED screen, a top-of-the-line processor, expandable storage, a great dual camera on the back, wireless charging and even a headphone jack – the only phone here to do so.But it is the stylus that pops out from a port in the bottom of the phone that sets it apart. It might be tiny, but it’s one of the best you can buy on any device. Draw, sign, annotate, poke, prod and even click the camera shutter with the new remote Bluetooth button option, to your heart’s content. When you’re done, you can just slot it in the bottom and forget about it. The stylus charges in seconds once docked and lasts about 30 minutes of continuous use.For now, the Note 9 only runs the older Android 8.1 version, not the latest Android 9 Pie like the rest. But the Note 9 is still the do-anything phone, if you can put up with its massive size.Verdict: For those that need a productivity powerhouse, the Note 9 is it.Apple’s iPhone XS is arguably the best smaller phone on the market. Its 5.8in OLED screen is brilliant, while the all-screen design is space efficient, meaning it has a big screen squeezed into a small body.It also has a superfast processor, snappy performance and the excellent Face ID facial recognition system. The home button has been replaced with Apple’s best-in-class gesture system, which takes about 10 minutes to adjust to.The dual-camera system on the back is great, too, offering some of the best detailed photos, zoom and low-light performance. Apple’s excellent Portrait mode is fun, as are the face-tracking Animoji.Battery life is only OK, managing to get through most days, but you’ll need to charge it before heading out for a night on the town. Wireless charging in the back makes that easy, but the included cable charger is pretty slow.It’s also super expensive, but it has a luxurious feel that’s unrivalled in 2018, and it’s heavier than you might expect, so at least it feels like you’re getting £1,000 worth of phone. Most users will stick it in a case because the glass front and back will smash if dropped.Verdict: Pricey, but the best iPhone available and a brilliant combination of size and capability.The OnePlus 6T proves you don’t need £900-plus to buy cutting-edge technology.Building on the excellent OnePlus 6, the 6T has a great in-display fingerprint sensor and a tiny, widow’s-peak-like notch for the selfie camera. For £500 you get top‑of-the-line specs, plenty of storage, dual-sim support and a brilliant screen. You also get a good, but not quite the best, dual-camera system on the back, a good selfie camera on the front and good battery life.The OnePlus 6T is a brutally fast device with an Android experience that’s second only to Google’s Pixel 3. Gaming performance is solid, too, while there are plenty of customisation options, including a solid set of gestures for navigation that rival Apple’s.Despite having a glass back, there’s no wireless charging, but the cable charger is really fast. The alert slider switching between silent, vibrate and ring is a nice touch.Verdict: It may not have the best camera, but you have to spend nearly double to get a better phone than this.The Pixel 3 is arguably the best Android device with a comparatively small 5.5in screen. But unlike most smaller phones, it isn’t a cheaper, cutdown version of something larger.You get a top-of-the-line processor, a cracking single-camera system that’s better than most dual cameras and a bright, crisp OLED screen. You also get the best of Google, including Gmail’s autocomplete for blasting through mundane emails, lots of useful local AI tools, and three years of software updates.The Pixel 3 has an all-glass design, although not exactly all-screen, stereo speakers and even a dual-camera system on the front for shooting wide-angle selfies. Battery is only OK, but the two-tone glass back has wireless charging.But it is the ultra-refined experience that is the big draw, which offers an Apple-level of polish, raising the bar for Android.Verdict: The best Android experience you can buy in 2018, but not necessarily the best smartphone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3d4d84f209f4e661cc59858d100769f02c51f8b/400_598_2699_1619/master/2699.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a5f2509115526471df30e033ed7c95e","title":"claims gibraltar betrayal under cover darkness","story":"Theresa May has been accused of betrayal after giving way to Spain’s demands over the future of Gibraltar, a disputed British overseas territory, in the latest concession designed to keep the Brexit deal on track. With the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, threatening to veto May’s deal at Sunday’s leaders’ summit in Brussels, the British government was forced to publicly concede on Saturday that Gibraltar will not necessarily be covered by a future trade deal.Sánchez immediately claimed that he would use the concession to force the British to open talks on joint sovereignty of Gibraltar, over which Spain has had a claim since the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.He said: “Once the UK has left the EU, Gibraltar’s political, legal and even geographic relationship with the EU will go through Spain …“Spain will be a fundamental pillar of the relationship between Gibraltar and the EU as a whole.“When it comes to the future political declaration, the European council and the European Commission have backed Spain’s position, and backed it as never before.“In these fundamental future negotiations, we’re going to have to talk about joint sovereignty and many other things with the UK.”Madrid has always insisted that Gibraltar should be covered by agreements struck between the EU and the UK only with Spain’s consent. The Spanish government was furious when an article in the withdrawal agreement appeared to suggest that any future trade deal would also cover the disputed territory.Downing Street was accused of “acting under the cover of darkness” in inserting the clause, known as article 184. Sánchez had warned that he would snub Sunday’s Brexit summit unless he had written and public assurances from Downing Street that Spain would have a crucial say in Gibraltar’s future.That reassurance came on Saturday in the form of a letter from the British ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, laying out the British government’s acceptance that the withdrawal agreement “imposes no obligations regarding the territorial scope” of a future trade deal.“She believes that even the worst deal is acceptable. It isn’t.”Clare Moody, Labour’s MEP for Gibraltar, said: “What is remarkable is that Theresa May has gone to Brussels to concede further text at this stage, before we’ve even left.“The only way to maintain Gibraltar’s status is for the UK to remain in the EU – that is why we need a ‘people’s vote’.”Amid a growing outcry over the government’s concession, the prime minister insisted that nothing had changed over the UK’s territorial claim to Gibraltar. She also dismissed claims from Spain’s foreign minister that the agreement on the Rock had been a victory for Madrid, delivering a treaty that was “the most important one since the Utrecht Treaty of 1713”, that handed the territory to the British.Theresa May said: “The UK’s position on the sovereignty of Gibraltar has never changed and will not change.“I’m proud that Gibraltar is British and I will always stand by Gibraltar.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a31c4abb69d8db27f672d5fd4ebdaa9721363935/0_238_4642_2786/master/4642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6508151fbe8ec4d3d941cdeafc5db042","title":"democratic republic of congo presidential race opens","story":"The opposition in the DRC is fractured and two of its leading figures have been barred from standingCampaigning will start in earnest this week for the much-delayed presidential election in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Observers hope the polls will bring the DRC’s first democratic transfer of power, but many fear further destabilisation and conflict in an already unstable region.President Joseph Kabila, who has ruled since his father’s assassination in 2001, is backing his former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary against an opposition that is weakened both by disunity and the government’s moves to prevent key candidates from standing.Observers describe Shadary as a political nonentity who will be easily manipulated by Kabila. “We are sure we will win, by what margin is up to the people,” Lambert Mende, the information minister, said. “It is enough to look at our adversaries to understand we will win for sure.”Kabila had strongly resisted efforts to make him stand down but came under concerted pressure from Angola and South Africa, concerned by the prospect of further conflict in the resource-rich country.Arrangements for the election on 23 December are highly controversial. There is deep concern about new electronic voting machines, which critics say are more vulnerable to rigging than paper and ink and could be compromised by an erratic power supply. In addition, two of the biggest names among the opposition have been unable to stand.Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former warlord and vice-president who returned to the DRC in August after being acquitted of war crimes by the international criminal court, has been ruled out on legal grounds, while Moïse Katumbi, a wealthy businessman and former governor of Katanga province, has been stopped from returning home. He faces court cases in the DRC on charges that he says are trumped up and has been in exile in Europe for more than two years.An agreement among leading opposition politicians to collectively back the widely respected parliamentarian Martin Fayulu to face Shadary fell apart within 24 hours. But on Friday Félix Tshisekedi, leader of the biggest opposition party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, announced he would stand with Vital Kamerhe, a second significant opposition leader, as his running mate.“The Congolese political class has demonstrated its venality, betraying a population that has repeatedly pushed for its right to elect a new president in a free and fair process,” Stephanie Wolters, an expert at the Institute for Security Studies in Johannesburg, wrote last week.Kabila took over from his father, Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who was assassinated by a bodyguard in 2001. He remained in power despite his second term ending in 2016, under a constitutional clause that enables a president to stay in office until a successor is elected.“Kabila was not a strong man. He has to balance elite interests. There was no elite consensus on who might replace him and there still isn’t,” said Alex Vines, head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a thinktank in London.Many provinces are in the grip of armed conflict and millions have had to flee from their homes. Officials in the DRC claim only 230,000 people have been displaced, which is a fraction of the UN’s estimate of 4.5 million.There has also been the country’s worst outbreak of Ebola. In an update published last week, the World Health Organisation reported 36 new confirmed cases. Officials have so far recorded 346 confirmed cases, including 175 deaths.The fight against the outbreak has been plagued by security problems, with health workers attacked by rebels in districts around the town of Beni where the virus has been spreading. This month, Ebola containment operations were paused after seven UN peacekeepers and 12 Congolese soldiers were killed in clashes with one of the many militias operating in the east of the country, but all activities have resumed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/757d0598af5b76afa9ebc525b7ed4cf52ef1f585/0_116_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2d143a5df96f121a6b8c697fbe774cd","title":"mummified woman dating back 3000 years unveiled in egypt","story":"Mummy found inside sarcophagus in Luxor tombs that also contained statues and figurinesA well-preserved mummy of a woman inside a previously unopened coffin dating back more than 3,000 years has been unveiled in the southern Egyptian city of Luxor.The sarcophagus was one of two found earlier this month by a French-led mission in the Al-Assasif necropolis on the western bank of the Nile. The first one had been opened earlier and examined by officials, but Saturday’s unveiling was the first time authorities had opened a previously unopened sarcophagus before international media.One of the two contained the “well-preserved” mummified remains of a woman named Thuya, the antiquities ministry said in a statement, but ministry spokeswoman Nevine Aref later said work was continuing to definitively identify the name of the mummy.“One sarcophagus was rishi-style, which dates back to the 17th dynasty, while the other sarcophagus was from the 18th dynasty,” the minister of antiquities, Khaled al-Anani, said. “The two tombs were present with their mummies inside.”The 18th dynasty dates back to the 13th century BC, a period noted for some of the most well-known pharaohs, including Tutankhamun and Ramses II.Located between the royal tombs at the Valley of the Queens and the Valley of the Kings, the Al-Assasif necropolis is the burial site of nobles and senior officials close to the pharaohs.Among the finds in the tomb were sarcophagi, statues and some 1,000 funerary figurines called ushabtis, made of wood, faience and clay.The tomb belonged to Thaw-Irkhet-If, the mummification supervisor at the Temple of Mut in Karnak, according to the ministry. The tomb, which also contains mummies, skeletons and skulls, dates back to the middle kingdom – almost 4,000 years ago – but was reused during the late period.Rubble 300m deep was removed over five months to uncover the tomb, which contained coloured ceiling with paintings depicting the owner and his family.Egypt has revealed over a dozen ancient discoveries since the beginning of this year. The country hopes these discoveries will brighten its image abroad and revive interest among travellers who once flocked to its famed pharaonic temples and pyramids, but who have shunned the country since its 2011 political uprising.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a561dc4f5b48bbe3736d391442a0a20d47aa6e48/20_115_3930_2358/master/3930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99fe1a3a28353b1ba1afff617681a7c8","title":"swiss voters take the cow by the horns referendum armin capaul","story":"Farmer Armin Capaul’s long campaign to keep animals intact makes it onto a referendum ballotWith his woolly hat, straggly grey beard and unswerving passion for the wellbeing of his cows, it’s no wonder Armin Capaul has become a media sensation. And the Swiss farmer has used the limelight to his advantage.After eight years of campaigning for farmers to be paid to keep the horns of their cattle intact, the issue will be settled in a referendum today.“I never dreamed I’d be sitting here,” Capaul, 67, said at the launch of his referendum campaign last month. “I only wanted to give the cows and goats a voice … If the cows could choose, they’d have horns.”Contrary to Swiss tourist board images of horned cows roaming idyllic mountain pastures, up to two thirds of cows in Switzerland are hornless. While most dairy cow breeds are born with horns, it’s widespread practice to remove them at a few weeks old using a heated iron.Hornless animals are easier and cheaper to keep as they don’t have to be tethered in inidual pens to avoid accidents. But Capaul argues that it’s cruel to deprive the animals of their horns, which he says they use to communicate, stay cool and clean themselves. He wants farmers to be granted subsidies to cover the costs associated with keeping the horns.“The horn is a heavily perfused, life-long growing organ,” it says on the website of the cow horn initiative, which Capaul founded. “It is linked to the digestive system, important for body care, and serves to communicate among other cows. Cows and goats wear their horns with pride and mindfulness. They clarify, for example, the hierarchy at a distance, by showing each other their horns.”Capaul, who lives on his farm on the border of Jura and Bern in western Switzerland, first wrote to the authorities asking for a subsidy in 2010. He received no reply.So he started his own people’s initiative. Under Swiss direct democracy, a group of citizens can force a referendum on an issue if they collect 100,000 supporting signatures within 18 months. Politicians scorned Capaul at first but the media quickly fell in love with the oddball farmer.Since then, Capaul’s long-running campaign has been the subject of thousands of news reports in Switzerland and has been picked up by foreign media across the world. His battle has inspired documentaries and books. And now, at last, his moment has come. “I’m here thanks to the media,” Capaul said at the campaign launch. “They were so enthusiastic.”But not everyone is so enthused. Both the Swiss parliament and the federal council have spoken out against the initiative, which could cost the state an estimated 10m-30mSwiss francs (£8m-£24m) in subsidies.Capaul’s most vocal critic is Johann Schneider-Ammann, the minister responsible for agricultural policy. He denies animals suffer from horn removal and suggests keeping them could do animals more harm than good if they have to be tethered rather than free to roam.“The initiative would be an own goal in terms of animal welfare. It might sound nice, but it would have negative consequences for the animals and for the farmers,” he told SRF, the Swiss state broadcaster."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Irish Red Cross awards recognise pupils\u0026rsquo campaign to revoke classmate\u0026rsquos deportationLeaders agreed text of UK withdrawal from EU warning deal is best Britain will getSubstantial damage caused to Caiseal Mara Hotel as garda\u0026iacute investigate arson attackDublin teacher was found dead in his apartment in Cape Town earlier this monthDefence minister describes vandals as the \u0026lsquolowest of society\u0026rsquoPolice open murder investigation as man found with significant injuries to head and bodyFemale driver of second car and male front-seat passenger both sustain minor injuriesNumbers applying for Irish documents in wake of Brexit vote continue to increaseTravel, border controls and pension rights are becoming a real worryA total of 140 babies underwent therapeutic hypothermia treatment over two yearsEx-foreign secretary tells DUP conference North would be \u0026lsquoeconomic semi-colony of EU\u0026rsquoFoster also issues abject apology over \u0026lsquocash for ash\u0026rsquo scheme , saying lessons will be learnedIrish Rail says trains to depart Heuston and other terminus stations as soon as possibleSiblings recall trial at which their sister\u0026rsquos husband Eamonn Lillis was found guilty of manslaughterDUP MP: Brussels and Dublin must do more to \u0026lsquoexplore\u0026rsquo alternatives to avoid hard borderBoy to be sentenced next year for attempting to murder woman in Dun LaoghaireDodds says DUP \u0026lsquowill be tried and tested like never before\u0026rsquo over Brexit in coming daysFlights resume after temporary suspension on Saturday morning\u0026lsquoViolence against women and girls is one of the most widespread, persistent and devastating human rights violations in our world\u0026rsquoDrumlish native Danny McGee was found unresponsive outside bar in Queens"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709748.1543154537!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu leaders have endorsed brexit deal at summit in brussels","story":"In a press conference in Brussels, President of the European Commission Donald Tusk, confirmed that the 27 EU states have ratified Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. Video: European Commission\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker arriving  for a special meeting of the European Council in Brussels on Sunday. Photograph: Sascha SteinbackEPA European Union leaders warned the British parliament not to wreck Theresa May’s Brexit deal, saying a package agreed with the prime minister on Sunday was the best Britain will get.“Those who think that, by rejecting the deal, they would get a better deal, will be disappointed,” European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters after the 27 other EU leaders formally endorsed a treaty setting terms for British withdrawal in March and an outline of a future EU-UK trade pact.Asked whether there was any chance Brussels would reopen the pact if an alliance of pro- and anti-Brexit forces votes it down in the House of Commons, Mr Juncker simply stressed “this is the best deal possible” - although summit chair Donald Tusk sounded more guarded, saying he did not want to consider hypotheticals.Mrs May used a post-summit news conference to make a sales pitch for her plan, telling television viewers at home that it was the “only possible deal”, offering control of UK borders and budgets while maintaining close cooperation with EU regulations that was good for business and the security of the broader region.“In any negotiation, you do not get everything you want. I think the British people understand that,” said Mrs May who arrived after the endorsement to voice hopes for continued close ties.Parliament’s vote could open the door to a “brighter future” or condemn the country to more ision, she said. “I will make the case for this deal with all my heart,” she added, declining to answer whether she would resign if parliament rejects it.The alternative to the withdrawal treaty between the EU and the UK formally signed off in Brussels on Sunday morning is “no deal and a cliff edge Brexit”, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said after the conclusion of the summit.“It’s going to become more and more obvious that the alternative to this deal is a no deal scenario,” Mr Varadkar told reporters after EU leaders emerged from the EU Council meeting.Echoing other EU leaders, Mr Varadkar said that the withdrawal treaty is the “only deal that’s on the table.”“I hear a lot of people talking about better deals and alternative deals. And anyone can have a better deal or an alternative deal in their own minds but an agreement - 500 pages long, that 28 member states can sign up to - nobody has that,” he said.Asked if he was ruling out any change to the exit mechanism from the backstop, which has emerged as a significant issue in London, the Taoiseach replied: “I am, and it’s not just me, it’s the entire European Union today was very much of the view there couldn’t be a renegotiation.“You know, it wasn’t easy to get to this point. And once you start to open up one issue, you could potentially open up other issues as well. We saw in the last couple of days the extent to which Gibraltar could become an issue. Some countries were reluctant to accept that there will be a single customs territory between the EU and the UK because they feel that gives the UK preferential access to European markets.“So you see that is the core difficulty with people who are arguing that there is a better deal on offer or a better deal can be negotiated. They don’t agree among themselves what a better deal could be, they probably wouldn’t have a majority in parliament for an alternative deal, and they certainly wouldn’t have 28 member states signed up to it,” he said.“So really what’s being put before the European Parliament and the House of Commons is a deal - any other deal really only exists in people’s imaginations,” Mr Varadkar added.“There are almost as many alternatives as there are MPs. Any one of us could in our own minds dream up a perfect deal that would be better for us, but the whole point of any of these alternatives that are being mooted is that they would not command support of 28 member states ... These are just ideas that people have,” he said.Mr Varadkar said that he understood the position of the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May’s minority government, but he would “posit a counterview”.He said that the deal agreed between the UK and the EU was “very much in line with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement”.He stressed that everyone accepted that Northern Ireland was and would remain part of the United Kingdom until such time as the people of Northern Ireland vote otherwise, but that because of its “unique history and unique geography” it had special arrangements “that on occasion make it a little different from the rest of the UK.”Mr Varadkar said he believed Mrs May’s chances of passing the vote in the House of Commons would improve “as decision day approaches”.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the bloc’s veteran guiding force, echoed that unwillingness to speculate on what she called a “historic day” that was both “tragic and sad”.But Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose country chairs EU meetings until the end of the year, said there could be no more negotiations.“There is no Plan B,” said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. “If anyone thinks in the United Kingdom that by voting No something better would come out of it, they are wrong.”Amid praise for the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier’s team for bringing home a deal after 18 months of gruelling talks, Mr Juncker said it was “no time for champagne”, as one of Europe’s great powers walks out after its 2016 Brexit referendum. The harder work of building new relations now lies ahead, he added.The 27 leaders took barely half an hour to rubber-stamp the 600-page withdrawal treaty, aimed at an orderly exit on March 29th to be followed by two to three years of a status-quo transition period. The outline of a future trading and security partnership was just 26 pages long.Mrs May’s critics say it leaves Britain tied to EU regulations that it will no longer have a say in setting. Her foreign minister, Jeremy Hunt, said that the Brexit deal was a “staging post” towards Britain getting everything it wanted from leaving the EU, but that the arithmetic for getting the deal approved was looking “challenging”.Mr Tusk said the bloc was determined to have as close as possible a partnership with Britain, which has long been sceptical about EU integration: “We will remain friends until the end of days. And one day longer,” he said.French President Emmanuel Macron said Britain’s Brexit vote showed Europe needed reform. He stressed that Paris would hold Britain to tight EU regulations, in return for giving it easy trade access. He also foreshadowed coming, fraught, negotiations by demanding access to British fishing grounds after Brexit.Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite spoke of several scenarios if parliament blocks the package: that Britons would hold a second referendum hold a new election to replace Mrs May or return to Brussels to try and renegotiate the package. Britain could also simply crash out on March 29th.Both sides have been making preparations for such a “no deal” scenario.The pound has strengthened since the deal came together over the past 10 days, but companies and investors remain nervous.The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May’s minority government, said it would try to block the deal because it binds London to many EU rules and the DUP fears it may weaken the province’s ties to Britain - a result of efforts to avoid a risk of a hard border on the island of Ireland.DUP leader Arlene Foster said on Sunday she would “review” the agreement to back Mrs May’s Conservative government if the Brexit orce is passed by Britain’s parliament.Wrangling over how to keep open Northern Ireland’s land border with the EU dogged much of the Brexit talks.Britain’s 300-year-old naval base in Gibraltar on Spain’s southern coast, had also threatened to derail plans. But Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he was satisfied with guarantees on Saturday of a say in Gibraltar’s future, saying on Sunday that Spain wanted to claim a share of sovereignty over “The Rock”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Arlene Foster and her senior MPs may have been assailed by business and farmer leaders for more than a week, but not an inch was conceded there was no surrender on the DUP’s adamant opposition to the withdrawal agreement.Chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond tried his best to change minds at the DUP private dinner on Friday night, as did international trade secretary Liam Fox when he visited Newry on Friday.But no ground was conceded, and there never was going to be. Instead, it was left to former cabinet minister Boris Johnson to excite the delegates with his talk of that “throbbing, enigmatic, humming thing”.And to avoid any confusion over this phallic metaphor, this was in fact a reference to (Star Wars character) Obi Wan Kenobi’s light sabre, first made in Johnson’s Uxbridge constituency, as he told us.And its relevance? Well, it was pointing to the greatness of the United Kingdom as it prepares to leave the EU and its “most dynamic creative culture and media industries”.He was a good warm-up act for Foster. The delegates enjoyed it as he shifted metaphor by warning the withdrawal agreement would make the UK a “satellite” state, as opposed to a “vassal” state – the favoured description of last week.It was the same message from Nigel Dodds and from MEP Diane Dodds, who with Brexit wants to do herself out of a job as soon as possible.Diane Dodds displayed considerable chutzpah by quoting Seamus Heaney when anticipating the great day when the UK exits the European Union: “We must believe a further shore is reachable from here.”Now there’s a quote that will infuriate the Remain arts lobby.Arlene Foster, in a conciliatory nod to the South of the Border, said the DUP did not “want barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and our neighbours in the Republic”.On the other hand, Nigel Dodds, in an apparent reference to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, complained about “those in other jurisdictions trying to play up their republican credentials in advance of a forthcoming general election”.What was most arresting was the abject nature of Foster’s apology over the calamitous Renewable Heat Incentive scheme. As leader of the party she personally apologised and said “as a party we are deeply, deeply sorry”.She didn’t spare Ian Paisley jnr, who was at the conference after his recent return from suspension over taking expensive family holidays to Sri Lanka – the bill footed by the Sri Lankan government.In an implicit reference to the North Antrim MP and perhaps others, she said over the past 12 months “there have been a number of other areas where behaviour in our ranks has not matched the standards expected of people holding public office”.Those were the main themes of her speech, opposing the Brexit deal and displaying sackcloth and ashes over cash and ash.A lesser theme was that of restoring Stormont. Perhaps too much shouldn’t be read into it, but there was a possible hint of how the DUP might seek to get politics back working – when and if this whole Brexit mess is half sorted.It was interesting that on Thursday, Peter Robinson effectively advised unionists not to get hung up on an Irish language Act – the main issue that wrecked the prospects of reinstating the Northern Executive and Assembly early this year.Foster did not follow his lead but she did say that a “Cultural Deal” was needed “for everyone in Northern Ireland that respects difference and fosters understanding”.“It is in unionism’s interests for those from all backgrounds to feel comfortable in a Northern Ireland at peace with itself,” she added.Maybe there is something there to work on?Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Michele Eve SandbergAFPGetty More than two weeks after the US midterm elections, a final result has yet to emerge as a handful of House races remain to be counted.But as Americans digest the results this Thanksgiving weekend, there is plenty of food for thought as the country looks ahead to 2020.While the election may have presented a split picture and a somewhat gloomy reflection on the polarisation that has become entrenched in American society, it was a good day for democracy. More people voted in the midterm elections than any non-presidential election since 1914. \u0026nbspA total of 49.2 per cent of eligible voters cast their ballot – this compares to a turnout of 36.4 per cent in the midterms of 2014. Though still low by international standards, this uptick in political participation is a positive sign.Most of this surge in voter engagement reflected a higher turnout by Democratic voters. In the House of Representatives race – where they flipped at least 39 seats – the Democrats outpaced Republicans significantly. More than 60 million people voted for Democrats in the House race. This compares to about 45 million for Republicans in 2010 when the party wrested control of the House of Representatives following a backlash against Obamacare. The level of support achieved by the Democrats is impressive – particularly as it is close to the 63 million votes Donald Trump received in the 2016 presidential election.But while the Democrats surged ahead in the popular vote once again, that did not necessarily translate into electoral wins.Democrats won reliably Democratic seats by large margins, though they failed to win House seats in conservative states such as Idaho or Montana for example. Democratic gains in Republican-leaning suburbs around the country were significant, however, and a real concern for Republicans going into 2020.On the Senate side, the picture was equally skewed – Democratic candidates garnered 12 million more votes than Republicans in Senate races though the party still managed to lose some seats. The apparent discrepancy again puts the spotlight on the Senate electoral process. Republicans continue to benefit from a structural advantage that the Senate system gives to conservative-leaning rural states. Under America’s electoral system, each of the 50 states gets two senators, regardless of population. Consequently, California, with a population of more than 40 million, has the same representation in the Senate as Wyoming, with a population of just over half a million.While defenders of the system argue that the Senate was never supposed to truly represent the popular vote, but rather give a voice to states, the political hue of the Senate has implications far beyond parliamentary democracy.In particular, the Senate plays a direct role in electing judges to the supreme court and to federal courts, a system that has resulted in a more conservative-leaning supreme court than the political dispensation of the population as a whole as indicated by the popular vote.While there appears to be little appetite within the US to change the system, Democrats have long taken solace from demographic changes which are expected to help their party in the long term.Population shifts and the increasing ersification of American society suggest that the political map is changing in their favour. The Democrats may not have been able to break the “red wall” of vast swathes of Republican-leaning rural America, but they are already making inroads into once reliably Republican states such as Arizona, Nevada and even Texas as the population of those states becomes more erse.This month’s election also delivered positive outcomes for Democrats looking to address the problem of voter representation. Several states included on their ballots proposals to change local election law. Voters in Michigan, for example, voted by two to one to loosen voter requirements, including moves to allow same-day voter registration, the expansion of absentee voting and the reintroduction of “straight” party voting, which allows voters to vote for one party for all positions by just checking one box – a long-standing process in Michigan that was abolished by the Republican-led legislature in 2015.In Florida, voters backed an amendment to allow felons to vote, with some exceptions – a move that will restore voting rights to more than one million people.In an election that was also notable for unsubstantiated allegations by President Donald Trump of voter fraud, moves to ensure that all US citizens who are entitled to vote can do so are a welcome development. Whether it will help the Democrats electorally will be a central question for the party as it heads into the next election cycle. \u0026nbspDemocrats take back the House.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

2017 | Terror attacks in the UK“We are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their platforms,” he said.In its report yesterday on the terrorist attacks, the ISC revealed an MI5 assessment showed “almost all attack planners downloaded, shared or consumed radical and extremist media of some kind.”Salman Abedi, the Manchester Arena bomber who killed 22 people including children, had also been able to manufacture his improvised explosive devices from online videos.“Action that affects their profits hits home harder than any sense of ‘doing the right thing’, and it is this that the Government should focus its efforts on.The committee highlighted cases where tech firms had refused to remove extremist content or co-operate despite Government requests, often citing the right of their customers to privacy as “trumping other considerations.”In one, an unnamed tech firm claimed the “violent and disturbing images” linked back to an academic site and to remove it “would compromise the quality of analysis the site owner provides.” Another refused to take down the website of a banned terrorist group.WhatsApp cited its “end to end encryption” for not revealing to police the final messages of  Westminster attacker Khalid Masood who stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death.The committee said it had been among the first to castigate the social media firms for failing to be more proactive in hunting down and removing extremist material rather than relying on users, organisations or police to alert them to it.But that was, four years ago after the terrorist murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.Although the firms have hired more moderators to assess material, the committee was frustrated that they continued in many cases to be used as a “safe haven” for extremists and terrorists.Searching the internet for “how to make a bomb” returned almost 2m results and a search for “beheading video” returned 250,000 hits in a study five years ago - and it was likely to have increased since.Although the tech firms were developing algorithms to track down terrorist material and alert police to it, the MPs said: “It is disappointing that - despite a great deal of engagement - little tangible progress has been made in the four years...and the scale of the challenge remains significant.”The criticism was backed last night by Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, who this week wrote to Twitter, demanding to know why extremist material from a proscribed far right group was still available on its site.“It is frankly outrageous that these internet giants continue to profit off dangerous content, which we know can have fatal consequences,” she told The Daily .“These companies have been asked repeatedly to develop better systems to remove illegal material and have failed to do so. It is not good enough.”“Given the vast scale of this content, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are simply not equipped to tackle this issue alone. Social media companies must immediately take responsibility for dealing with extremist and illegal materials on their sites.”Senior counter terror officers said they had struggled to get quality data out of the tech giants for years. “They simply don’t get it, so to take action that affects their advertising revenues would be the best thing to do,” said one ex-counter terror chief.DUP locked in secret talks with Cabinet ministers over a \u0026#39Plan B\u0026#39 Brexit plan, Arlene Foster confirmsEU leaders approve Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - but minister admits Government could collapse if it fails in CommonsRussia blockades strategic waterway to stop Ukrainian ships entering Azov SeaSpain faces backlash in last minute threat to sabotage Brexit deal over GibraltarAirstrikes hit Syria\u0026#39s last rebel stronghold after alleged gas attack on regime-held AleppoUganda ers search for bodies after more than 30 killed in Lake Victoria pleasure boat accidentComment: The police moped crime strategy is worrying - why are politicians cheering on unjustified violence?What is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?How does NASA\u0026#39s InSight compare to Hollywood\u0026#39s The Martian?Comment: This is what knife crime really looks like –  and this is what is causing itNavy sailors recalled to warship in aftermath of Salisbury nerve agent poisoning over fears of attack while ashoreDozens of \u0026#39innocent\u0026#39 dogs being destroyed under Dangerous Dogs Act, new figures show Vincent Van Gogh statue in Brixton will not feature pipe, gun or razor bladeBrighton homeowners could face prosecution if they fail to remove graffiti from their property Comment: In defence of Jacob Rees-Mogg and his Brexit Dad\u0026#39s ArmyComment: 20mph zones aren\u0026#39t really about making roads safer – they\u0026#39re about stopping people driving altogetherNotting Hill Bookshop is inundated with requests as location for marriage proposals ahead of film\u0026#39s 20th anniversaryBrexit latest news: Britain accused of caving in over Gibraltar - live updatesComment: Let\u0026#39s get to the root cause of the Grenfell tragedyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/23/TELEMMGLPICT000181399392_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1wRt9OKUQdm3ozQDx50efXTVJoqefb4nODplG_f3HAY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"inside north korea hidden aid packages belie kim jong uns promise","story":"Cha Song-Chol, supervisor at North Korea\u0026#39s Children\u0026#39s Foodstuffs factory, which is playing a vital role in the effort to alleviate child malnutritionThe Children’s Foodstuffs factory in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, has a proud tradition of nourishing generations of the country’s children with its fresh and powdered milk and delicious soybean yogurt drinks.Every morning at 7am, dozens of delivery vans set out from its regional branches to deliver nutritional products to thousands of kindergartens.

Cloudy with a Chance of MeatballsKicking us off is Phil Lord and Christopher Mille’s bizarre animated film about a scientist who creates a machine that transforms water into food. So far, not too crazy, but then the machine gets stuck in the sky and it starts raining food. Everything goes wrong and Flint Lockwood must save the day by flying up to the machine and kicking fried chicken butt. Yeah, a pretty crazy premise, but a fantastic film.Michael Fassbender may be one of the most bankable stars of the moment - having starred in the likes of Steve Jobs, X-Men and Macbeth - but in 2014, instead of flaunting his face, producers decided to make him wear a weird papier-mâché mask for the film’s near entirety. The plot see’s Fassbender’s titular character front a rock band, play SXSW and make ‘likeable’ music. It’s all just a bit strange.Almost anything with Bill Murray in it is a win in my book, but when you say the premise of Ground Hog day out loud - a weatherman who must relive the same day over and over again - it sounds quite boring. What transpired was one of Murray’s funniest films.With Star Wars being so prevalent in pop-culture, it’s hard to imagine a time when no-one except George Lucas knew what a Lightsaber was. Producers must have been shocked when this young director came into the office trying to sell a script about Luke Skywalker, R2D2, Darth Vader, Chewbacca and Stormtroopers. Thankfully, they believed in his vision and now we have one of the best sci-fi sagas of all time.A dream, within a dream, within a dream. Even those who watched Inception were left confused, let alone those who only heard what the film was about. Christopher Nolan’s final flick, however, was a masterclass in storytelling and one of the best films of the last ten years.The high-concept Speed is quite ridiculous really. Keanu Reeves can’t let a bus go below 50 miles per hour or it will blow up. It’s quite amazing how Jan de Bont managed to make his debut 116 minutes long in the first place, let alone making it a decent film in the process.Tim Burton is a director who could fill this entire list up. While he may have chosen to reboot numerous films in the past few years (Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the upcoming Dumbo 2) it was his original concepts that set him apart from everyone else. In Burton’s head, the love story of a man with scissors for hands and a young woman made complete sense, while for everyone else - from just the premise - it seemed entirely weird. Luckily, he was given the opportunity to make the film and a cult classic was born, all while Johnny Depp’s ability to play the outsider was solidified. Post-Hook and Aladdin, Robin Williams was on a role. One of his standout performances was as Mrs. Doubtfire, the father-turned-drag-housekeeper. As a premise, dressing your lead male as a woman wasn’t exactly new (see Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie), so the filmmakers ran the risk of it all seeming like an overdone joke. Luckily, Chris Columbus managed to pull off the ridiculous plot (how wouldn’t the kids know it’s their father, really?) leading to one of the funniest films of the 90s.Like Burton, most of Yorgos Lanthimos’s films could probably feature on this page, but we’ve gone with The Lobster. The film tells of a hotel where residents must find a suitable partner within 45 days otherwise they will be turned into an animal. Try to run away and the other residents will hunt you down with tranquillisers. The result was one of the best love stories of 2015.Some comic book superheroes should not be adapted to the big screen (*cough* Howard the Duck *cough*). Ant-Man is not one of them. Against all the odds, Paul Rudd and Peyton Reed managed to make a compelling film about a man who could shrink down in size and control ants. What’s incredible is that - somehow - the film quickly became one of Marvel’s most beloved films. Of course, everyone knew Marvel could pull off weird, having knocked it out of the park with s of the Galaxy the year before.Two ghosts living in their old home want to scare away the alive people who now live there. Unfortunately, the new home-owners can’t see them and so the ghosts have to call upon a deranged Michael Keaton to help them out. Add one of the strangest afterlife scenes in film history and you’ve got a brilliant film.While not an obvious contender like Star Wars or Beetlejuice, when you think about it, Forrest Gump is a weird idea. A below-average intelligent man, sitting on a bench, waiting for a bus, telling strangers about all the famous moments in history where he observedeffected. Thanks to Tom Hanks, Gump was a magical film of love and hope, winning over the hearts of thousands and becoming an instant classic.Another film from Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, The Lego Movie shouldn’t have worked. Making a beloved toy into a film it was all just a bit silly. Thankfully, Chris Pratt’s turn as Emmett (and a catchy song in “Everything is Awesome”) the film was a huge hit with critics and fans alike, and now we have a cinematic universe of Lego movies to come. Awesome?“Let’s get Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger, and Ben Whishaw to all play Bob Dylan in a single film”, Todd Haynes said.

While her original co-star Dick Van Dyke will appear, Andrews turned down Disney’s offer to return out of respect to Blunt’s portrayal of the magical nanny.Andrews has lent her voice to several films in the past, with roles in Despicable Me, Shrek 2 and Enchanted in which she was the narrator.Aquaman is released in the UK on 14 December, mere days before Mary Poppins Returns (19 December). The former DC adventure also stars Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson and Nicole Kidman.Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They won’t accept my BitPay, what’s the point of Black Friday sales fiat losers?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That could allow Apple to put the phone back on sale at a lower price.Apple designer Jony Ive explains his \u0027utterly absurd\u0027 way of workingThe new handsets released in September were available at an increased price compared with previous years: the new iPhone XR, pitched as the more affordable model, begins at the same price the top-end phones had been marketed at until the iPhone X came along.Instead of buying those new phones, customers have been opting for the iPhone 8, according to numerous reports. Price-conscious customers are realising they could buy last year\u0027s handset instead for a much lower cost\u0026nbsp– despite it not featuring the brand new iPhone design – and that is thought to be having an impact on sales of the more expensive models.It is not clear when the iPhone X will be re-introduced to the line-up, or even if it will make it back onto sale. The iPhone X features an almost identical design to the iPhone XS, but misses out on new features such as an improved camera and upgraded processor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

At six I wake in the box room bedroom at my grandparents that I’ve claimed as my own since coming to Cheshunt as a baby. Suddenly I’m 51: this is the last time I’ll ever sleep in this three-bed former council house on an estate on London’s northern edge. My paternal granddad Leslie died in 2014 and for over a year my nan Eileen has languished in a care home with worsening dementia, which means never again will she return to the house that for all those decades was the family home.After my grandfather returned from war, he, Nan and my infant father moved into a two-bed semi on a large estate being built for heroes called Bury Green: one of Nan’s ways to make ends meet was to clean the newly completed houses after the workmen had finished, walking the plank across muddy foundations, my father in her arms. When a larger, three-bed place came up further in they moved, the neighbours mucking in with hand carts.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memories. Soon, when Nan dies, or her savings run out, this house, the sole childhood home of my dad, uncle and auntie – which my grandparents agonised over buying due to their socialist principles – will be sold. After half a century, I look round for a final time, and close the door.How a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityRecently I realised that dozens of places important to my family stretching back 100 years took place along the A10New River layline between Cheshunt and Soho. The birthplace of my father, two of my grandparents and my two children the places where I, my parents, and grandparents, met our partners and where we married several of my former homes, plus the ones in which my mum, dad and grandparents grew up schools and universities where me, my kids, my parents and grandparents studied and worked, are all strung along a 20-mile route which I have decided to walk in one day: a long trek into my past, back to the warm heart of my city.The November sun is rising over “New” River (dating from 1613) at the end of the street, the same street on which Cliff Richard was raised and whose forged autographs my father sold round school as a kid. Cutting through the alley where I learnt to ride my bike and where louts often linger with flickering lighters, I leave the estate, passing the graveyard where my great-grandmother Flo is buried, and cross the metal footbridge that crosses the A10, watching trucks and cars thunder to and from London.Being political animals, my granddad ran the tenant’s association, Nan the Labour women’s section. One day in the Fifties she invited an earnest young prospective candidate (who had no chance despite estates like Bury Green, Cheshunt was Tory) to speak to the Labour ladies about his policies. Nan was mortified by the way the other women sat, listened and carried on knitting, needles flashing and clicking like praying mantes. The pleasant young man was Dennis Potter: years later, Nan would watch his TV play Vote, vote, vote for Nigel Barton\u0026nbspand shudder with recognition.Piggott and his mum Flo in 1915\u0026nbspAs you walk east on College Road a huge tree – possibly a cedar of Lebanon – that has barely changed since I was a kid marks the start of Blindman’s Lane. Here, at 55, my paternal grandfather Leslie Piggott grew up in a bungalow without hot water, one of five siblings to Florence and Edwin Piggott, who were doubly blessed. First, because Ed was stone deaf, thus escaping the trenches second, because he was a nursery foreman which meant there was always food on the table – unlike many homes in what in the Twenties was one of the poorest rural districts in England. (Their luck would change: their only daughter died of cancer and their son Vincent was killed in action in the Second World War).Even when I was a kid – spending many of my school holidays in Cheshunt – the town had become a distant suburb of London, joined by the threads of rail, river and road, but back in the Seventies the town was overwhelmingly white Tesco ran the town like the Cosa Nostra. Today’s inhabitants are more erse and Turkish grocers surround the Old Pond in my granddad’s youth, the only Turk most Cheshunt people would have met would have been at Gallipoli.Piggott at St George’s Church in 1940\u0026nbspAt Old Pond roundabout – where Vincent Piggott’s name is inscribed on the war memorial – I turn right down Turners Hill, past the library where my grandfather worked as a teen before discovering the money in the factory was better, past the site of long-demolished Merston House where he was born in 1915. Turners Hill merges into Crossbrook Street, which runs down to Waltham Cross (still as ugly as the day I was born) and has another family connection. In 1944, when my father Michael was just two weeks old, my grandfather wrote him a letter from his RAF base:“On a certain April evening in 1939, my pal ‘Ginger’ Liddard and I were off for a stroll and a drink along Crossbrook Street to Waltham Cross. In those days, I’m afraid, I was rather a heavy drinker, but anyhow I’ll leave the explanation of my sins until later, so back to my story. We had just passed Cheshunt Building Society when all of a sudden we heard a ‘Hullo’ from the opposite side of the road, and when ‘Ging’ and I looked over we saw, what appeared to us in the dim light, a pair of very young girls. We stuck our noses in the air, said ‘schoolgirls trying to be funny!’ and passed on our way to the nearest pub. On our way back to Cheshunt we ran into the two ‘schoolgirls’ again, this time on our side of the road, and lo! And behold! They were not schoolgirls but very pleasurable young ladies of some 17 years of age…”Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another lifeOne of the girls was one Eileen Ball from Enfield. The pair began courting Nan was much impressed by Granddad’s good manners, smart appearance and relative affluence as a skilled toolmaker he earned double most of his contemporaries. In 1940, Granddad was given leave from the RAF where he now worked as a Spitfire mechanic beneath Guy Gibson to marry Nan at St George’s Church, Hertford Road. The photographs of their wedding day will be instantly familiar to anyone with English ancestry: grandfather in uniform, grandmother in white. Go into any English home and you’ll find variations on the theme: an ancestor in uniform, smiling uncertainly into the lens (not wanting to be at the centre of this or indeed of anything), a determined, set look keep calm, and if you come home carry on propagating the genes.St George’s has hardly changed, to my unpractised eye: red brick, imposing, small memorial garden out front where a mourning woman lays flowers. A couple of streets further down I pass Unity Road, where my father was born in 1944. Bombing raids were a part of life: years later my nan, an air raid warden in the factory where she worked, recalled:“When Michael was about six weeks old, early one evening, I was breastfeeding him when we heard the sound of what we thought was a hit plane coming down. I shot under the table in my mum’s dining room crouching over Michael, who, luckily, was blissfully unaware of the danger and went on suckling!”Unity Road is suburban, low-rise, and seems more affluent than the surrounding blocks. I have a photograph from May 1945 of a Unity Estate VE tea party, Nan holding my father in her arms (unmissable, due to her habit of tippexing outlines round family members in any group photos). Now, on the corner, perhaps on the very site of that street party, stands a vast Lidl.From Unity Road it’s a slog through scrofulous suburbs and a characterless stretch of the A10 (the factories in which Granddad worked – Murex, Thorns, Manifold – are now retail parks) to Bertram Road, Bush Hill Park. My nan was born at 104, and grew up at 122, poor, half her father’s weekly wage of £2 from Ediswans lightbulb factory going on the rent.Nan’s dad, Arthur Ball – a name I imagine caused some merriment in the factory – also worked in the factories up the A10. Enfield was heavily industrialised and would be a prime target during the war. One of Arthur’s workmates was Jimmy Dimmock: he worked in the factory all week, then turned out for Spurs of a Saturday. When unemployed, which was often, Arthur – teetotal, musician, talented painter – set up a group for dole-drawers in a hut. He sat Eileen on his knee when she was five and explained how everyone had a right to clean linen nan took it to heart. She left school at fourteen to help out and got a job at the same factory as her dad, where she was known like all the typists as an “office tart”,\u0026nbspand at dinner time Arthur would come through the rubber doors that separated classes (factory and office pool) with his trolley and give her jam sandwiches a taste of an older England long since gone to Pot Noodle.Despite her poverty, Nan’s memories of childhood are generous and rich, recalling games in the street, kids in and out of one another’s houses, evenings round the piano, doting grandparents nine doors down.The current occupier of Nan’s childhood home, Peter, generously lets me come in and see the place Nan was raised. Peter, a rough, friendly decorator of 53, and his wife have lived here for years but are shortly moving to Winchmore Hill.I’m surprised at the size of the house, with its big back garden and kitchen extension, and have to remind myself that when Nan lived here the extension wouldn’t have existed, and lacked even electricity, let alone flatscreen TV.From Bertram Road it’s a drab, dreary walk to Arnos Grove, passing through the middle-class ghetto of Winchmore Hill (where my mother grew up in the station house), the site of Minchenden Grammar (which Mum attended with Lynne Franks and Martin Rushent), Mum’s first place of work – the Metal Box Company on the North Circular – to the former council flat where her father, my maternal granddad, resides. All these suburban streets look the same, and I keep getting lost: at one low point I have to double back and walk a mile out of my way uphill. I’m less than halfway through my odd odyssey and exhausted, and for the first time begin to worry I won’t make it, chide myself for failing to do any preparation whatsoever – unless you count walking to the offie.Despite Granddad’s claims, the Piggotts weren’t drinkers and the Balls of Methodist stock so when it comes to alcohol, I must take after my mum’s parents. My mum’s mum, Kit Walsh, had to leave Ireland when she got pregnant there are rumours Mum has an older sibling somewhere who was given away. When I was born my nan was still only 36 she’d give me whiskey to help me sleep. Nan was what you might call a character, and great fun. On one occasion when I stayed as a kid, she came in saying she’d just met Jesus on the tube. We thought she’d finally lost it then it transpired she’d met Robert Powell and given him whiskey from the bottle she kept in her fake fur coat and taught him to sing The Men Behind The Wire.Now 95, Jack Brown has lived in a smart three-bed flat in one of the four-storey blocks for 50 years, raising with Kit six children. Many of my holidays as a child were ided between here and Cheshunt, between my two sets of grandparents. Today all the blocks are covered in scaffolding, making them seem grimmer than ever: there’s no entry phone and when I bang on Granddad’s door he shouts fearfully from within: “Who’s that?”“Me, Granddad. Mark.” (Adding, as always:\u0026nbsp“Sandy’s son.”)Granddad opens the door, looking every day of 95: he is short, as are all my forebears, five two, stocky, face still fierce, still with a purple boozer’s nose though he can no longer drink anything but J2O. He shuffles back to the lounge on his walking stick and we sit at his desk. Kit died at Chase Farm in 2008 a few years later my mum’s youngest brother, my uncle, five years younger than me, assaulted his dad and went to prison. An exclusion order remains in place, and now Granddad’s only visitors are a daughter and her partner. I ask Granddad how he is.“Not so good,” he growls, still with a faint Ipswich burr in his accent after all the decades. “I got robbed.” A week earlier, two young men posing as workmen on the renovation used fake ID cards to gain access one distracted my grandfather while the other took £400 he’d been saving to buy his communist chums a pint for his birthday. A few days later, just down the road, a 98-year-old was beaten almost to death for his TV.Granddad looks shaken, vulnerable: this family is no stranger to bleak times (Nan mugged on her way home from Bingo, Uncle Liam, stabbed, Uncle Liam, brain-damaged, Uncle Liam, diagnosed with MS, Uncle Liam – who gave me my middle name – who died this year), but I sense this might be the last straw. What a sad end for a man who stood as a Communist Party MP, who ed into burning seas to save Navy comrades after his ship was torpedoed, who worked for 40 years for British Rail, where he showed John Betjeman how to change signals and who once travelled to Moscow with Kit by train. Nan Brown often told me how they were invited to a grand ball in Moscow and as they ascended the sweeping staircase she hissed at my grandfather: “Jack! Your flies are undone!” “That’s nothing,” said Granddad. “You’ve got your dress tucked in your knickers.”Created with Sketch.The London that could have been Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Planned in the 1960s when bus use was declining and personal car use was increasing.

Now I recall Nan Piggott telling me of the reception at my mum and dad’s wedding, where my Irish nan’s contribution to the buffet was a string of uncooked sausages and where during a slow dance Jack slid his hand down over Eileen’s bottom as his wife suggested wife-swapping to shocked Granddad Piggott: two very different families, brought together only briefly in a ceremony at Haringey Civic Centre, my mum’s black dress bulging visibly, guests including Fairport Convention.Neither my mum or dad recalls the date they married (the marriage itself only lasted two years), but both recall where I was conceived: at a Socialist Labour League conference in Morecambe, shortly after friend-of-the-Redgraves Gerry Healy told Mum: “I will sleep with you on the eve of the revolution.”For a time, Mum and Dad lived in Rosebery Road, Muswell Hill, in a house with a shared bathroom Mum recalls bopping around the living room to Dizzy Gillespie as her belly expanded. Dad was quite the lad about town in the mid-Sixties: hanging out in jazz clubs and\u0026nbspshebeens, a groovy dude in velvet pantaloons. Once, he tells me, Rod Stewart nicked his dope another time he was on the door of a party in Chelsea when four scruffy looking louts tried to enter. Dad barred their way, to be informed he’d bounced the Rolling Stones. Dad got into an unspecified spot of bother and the young couple went north to Manchester, where I was born: a northerner in spirit but not a drop of northern blood.From Wood Green it’s another slog, through Hornsey and Crouch End and up the hill to Hornsey Rise, then right along Hornsey Lane, thoroughly exhausted now, wolfing eclairs and Coke, the unseasonal November sun blinding. Just before Suicide Bridge – immortalised, if that’s the word, in my first novel Fire Horses – a passing white van smashes the wing mirror of a parked van and the debris of glass and torn metal hits me: the van doesn’t stop. Nor do I. Standing on the bridge I look down over the bowl of my city, London proper.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memoriesArchway Tower – where I used to sign on – has been transformed into an apartment block, reflecting the transformation of an area which in the 1980s – when I lived in a condemned row for three mostly unhappy years – was dubbed “where angels fear to tread”. We stuck the article on the wall, a badge of pride. Much of those years are now just a blur: dropping acid during the Great Hurricane, drinking with Pete Postlethwaite a blazing row with Kathy Acker.In my first published story, “Hatful of Holloway”, I imagined a terror attack in which Archway Tower is blown up and falls onto what used to be the Archway Tavern, a rough Irish pub where they cashed your giros at a counter and men waited each morning at six for the van to the site. The same year that story was published, I was at Archway Station with my wife and baby daughter when we heard about the 77 terror attacks: I remember looking down Junction Road, trying to work out the safest way home with our precious pram cargo, and suddenly it looked like a corridor of glass.Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another life. Crossing Highgate Hill, where Dick Whittington turned again, I walk down Dartmouth Park Hill, past the Whittington Hospital where two years apart our two children were born in the same delivery room, a continuation of a process of self-gentrification that mirrors the new N19, where plastered Irish builders have become Damian Lewis and Benedict Cumberbatch. My Irish nan drank in the Boston in the 1950s, telling me how anyone who refused to put money in the IRA collection plate was thrown out the window the Boston remains satisfyingly down-market, with racing on the TV and smokers congregating at the door even as goths queue for the Dome next door.Limping past Cathcart Hill, where I lived from 1999 to 2013 with my wife and then our two children after nine brief months in the country we were pulled back, to Finsbury Park (where, in 1987, I presented Network Seven and hung out with junkies on Six Acre and Andover) and then back to the manor, to Warrender Road, where we live today.Utterly exhausted I enter the house: my wife makes me tea and sandwiches, Daughter, 14, teases me about my bedraggled appearance Son, 12 shows me the game he’s been creating on his laptop. It would be so easy to sit here and sleep: but I have made a promise, to myself at least, so after dumping my bag I say goodbye and walk, past Mercers Road, the first house in London I lived in aged 18, where a regular visitor – much to my excitement – was Roland “Fine Young Cannibals” Gift, then at the peak of his fame. In the distance I see London Met on Holloway Road, where I took a degree 10 years later, and where, 10 years after that, my first novel was launched (and sank without trace).Past Lloyds Bank at Highbury Corner, part of which used to be a curry house above which I shared a room with my oldest friend which had no windows, and maggots on the carpet, and where we had to place a disconnected door in the door-shaped hole to allow the other to defecate in peace. Where, the day in 1991 I received the letter confirming I’d been allocated my own little flat, I picked up a bottle of cider from the floor, took a swig in celebration, then realised it contained urine.Highbury Corner, where the Islington Twins used to hang out, and those older, odder twins used to walk up and down in matching checked suits, and where I once slept in bushes at the centre of the roundabout, and The Cock, where Arthur Mullard made me get off his stool. Down Upper Street, past 127, the site of Brown and Blair’s infamous Granita Pact, which I mentioned in a novel past the red-brick Municipal Office where I both worked and signed on past the town hall where in 2003 my wife and I were the first to be married in the chambers: we appear on council literature. My mum and dad met just around the corner, at an SLL meeting: they saw eye to eye, not only politically, but physically, dad being 5ft 2in, mum 4ft 11in.Between them they were over 10ft tall.To the Angel and past Nags Head, for so many years our pub of choice: sometimes when I had no money I’d walk up and down Upper Street for hours, watching all the drinkers behind warm glass. Taking a right up White Lion Street I pass a Hilton, bemused: in the 1980s King’s Cross was still rough. Up York Way, we attended “acid rock” warehouse parties in 1986 today I turn south onto Amwell Street, passing the flats where I lived with J and her mum back in 1989-90 before it all fell apart (all me – my bad).Filthy McNasty’s – where I set a key scene of my first book, and once drank with Shane MacGowan – is now the George and Monkey. One night on mushrooms I had a bad trip there, and Amwell Street extended to eternity. At Roseberry Avenue I pass Finsbury Town Hall, where I was once best man, stinking drunk because I’d just been on the telly.Exmouth Market had pie’n’mash and jellied eels when I lived in the Peabody Flats (1991-98) I pass the pub where the blind man used to give his guide dog Guinness in an ashtray. Down the steps I staggered down a thousand times: in Australia, 1994, homesick, I was watching A Fish Called Wanda when I saw those same steps, my own flat. I look up at the tiny bedsit where I lived and died a thousand deaths, crushed by loneliness and rage some rainy winter Sundays I would walk from my flat to the Thames without seeing a soul, go days without uttering a word. I became so introverted, so lacking in confidence and self-esteem that I began to imagine a huge coat which as I walked through the snow would erase all my footsteps, leave no trace. But then Clerkenwell Green around the corner is where I explained to J that one day, I would be quite the catch, and she laughed and at Clerkenwell Green I learnt my first novel was to be published.I’d only been living in Farringdon Lane a few months when a new neighbour moved into the flat directly upstairs. By a bizarre coincidence it was J’s best friend D, with whom we’d once trekked across Europe D now worked as a childminder for Mike Leigh and told him about this strange event. A year or two later, when Naked was released, I was somewhat perturbed by the similarities between the Thewlis character and myself. Pure coincidence, of course though later, when D told me about Secrets and Lies and I asked if it was about her, D laughed and said – “No, Mark – it’s about you. Again.”When I first got involved with the magazine, I was also still vaguely involved with Class War, agitating at Wapping, appearing on page 2 of The Sun holding a misspelt banner when Princess Anne came to tour the youth project I was locked in a room because they were scared that I’d burst out with placards.Memorial for Sikh soldiers vandalised in first week after unveilingBrain implants will soon allow hackers to ‘manipulate memories’How memory can help build confidence in the kitchenIt has grown dark, and as I begin the final stretch to Soho in my long back coat, I feel invisible. Am I really here, or just another ghost in a city full of ghosts from Roman armies to Amy Winehouse? My steps and breath shorten the pain in my thighs, calves, feet, hips intensify: but now I know I will make it.I pass the Phoenix, site of my second book launch in 2010, when it seemed authordom was mine and easy. Eighteen months later I was back on the dole. As I limp up Shaftesbury Avenue each step is a torment, but now I see my destination just across the road, in Soho proper: The Coach and Horses.Why end here? Well, I had to end somewhere, so why not a pub – one I frequented when Jeffrey Bernard propped up the bar, and I had to restrain a mate from flattening Norman Balon who’d called him a cunt, and where, years later, for two short hours, I was part of the media aristocracy?Entering, I order a Guinness. The barmaid smiles and serves. I check my pedometer: 48,664 steps, 20.7 miles. No, there’s another reason I picked this pub.1999: My lowest ebb. Having graduated from college and secured an agent I borrowed £10,000 from a bank in anticipation of the advance that was surely coming, and never did. With fellow loons I drifted across the capital, drinking and taking whatever else I could find all night and day, sometimes sleeping rough at one point in Oxford Street I lay on the bonnet of a car and was carried for several hundred yards. Then, later, as police came to arrest me for causing a disturbance in my flats, I smashed my fist through a window and almost severed the hand entirely I was rushed to hospital but after being bandaged left again, still buzzing. Next morning a doctor removed the temporary bandage and I saw my severed wrist, tendons and veins dangling, like a robot I was rushed back to hospital for emergency surgery.A few days later I wandered into the Coach and Horses, Soho, where a pretty trainee nurse from Liverpool smiled and seeing my ragged, loose sling said in a kind voice:“Are you OK?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The moment in question madeher look incapable of reading aloud and saw co-presenter\u0026nbspTess\u0026nbspDaly silently stunned as the floor manager (presumably) fainted. \u0026nbspUp until then, the most shocking moment of the night was one of this series’s favourites – former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts – only finishing third on the leaderboard.Here are the episode\u0027s five biggest talking points.There were many sniggers about how our seven remaining couples might crash into each other when they all took to the floor simultaneously to lindyhop the audience into submission. But in the end, it was the judges who provided the carnage. When the music stopped,\u0026nbspBallas was asked to read out who came 7th. After a technical error meant her digital read out was unavailable, she reached for a scrap of paper and duly read out who had come first. Then she got the names of the professional dancers wrong. And was left to tie herself in knots before Claudia Winklemen eventually diffused the tension with a couple of one-liners. Seann\u0026nbspand Katya will be furious they now have competition for the most awkward moment of the series.Faye and Giovanni’s dream waltzAshley and Pasha remain the only couple to receive a perfect 40 (translation: the only ones that\u0026nbspCraig Revel-Horwood has given a ten), but Faye\u0026nbspTozer and her partner, Giovanni, got really close tonight. They were nervous after abandoning their American Smooth to save Gio’s bad back mid-week, \u0026nbspin favour of a waltz mid-week. But you couldn’t tell: it was a dreamy, graceful routine met with a shower of judges’ compliments. They finished top of the leaderboard and surely booked their place in next week’s quarter final.Stacey and Kevin’s fierce pasoStacey Dooley loved her Blackpool salsa so much she didn’t wash her hair for a week to preserve the memories. Watch her interview on Friday’s It Takes Two if you don’t believe me. After initially panicking about the ‘Paso Dooley’, she really attacked this number and Kevin choreographed an incredible routine to atmospheric, authentic music. After waiting all series for a ten they got three. See you in the final, Stace.Created with Sketch.

While Shirley and Brrruno adored Joe sugg’s hip-hop inspired routine with props, tricks and writhing around on the ground, Craig and Darcey were a bit more reserved. Two tens seemed rather generous, but then again Strictly are always looking to encourage younger viewers to stay watching the show…Lauren’s out of her depthAfter hoping last week’s low-scoring Argentine Tango was a one-off, Lauren Steadman was gutted to get underwhelming feedback for her salsa tonight. Public support saves her every week, however vulnerable her spot on the leaderboard, but she’s struggling to keep up with the competition now. Will her fans save her again? Pool enthusiasts certainly won’t be impressed after she and her partner, AJ, wrecked a perfectly good table by jumping on it.So, who will go? This is a very different question from who ‘should’ go? While Lauren was by far the weakest dancer, dance-off regulars Graeme and Charles both find themselves on the bottom half of the leaderboard. One of them is bound to run out of luck tomorrow night….Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

The arithmetic in the House of Commons currently suggests it will be rejected by a wide margin if nothing changes.Mr Juncker described Britain’s departure as a “tragic moment”.“I would vote in favour of this deal because this is the best deal possible for Britain,” he told reporters on the doorstep of a Brussels summit to sign off the deal.“This is the deal. It\u0027s the best deal possible and the EU will not change\u0026nbspits fundamental position when it comes to these issues.”Theresa May writes \u0027letter to nation\u0027 insisting Brexit agreement worksMay urged to \u0027bin\u0027 Brexit deal by DUPArlene Foster to criticise Brexit deal at DUP conference He added: “The UK leaving the EU is a tragic moment. Not a moment to celebrate.”But arriving at the same meeting, French president Emmanuel Macron said: “It\u0027s not a day when we should celebrate, nor a day of mourning. It is the choice of a sovereign people.”He added that Britain’s departure showed the EU had a “fragile” side and was in need of reform. He also pledged that the deal would protect the access of French fishermen to British waters.Mr Barnier, who is also attending the meeting, said: “All along this extraordinary negotiation, very difficult we have worked to reach a deal. That means to organise in an orderly fashion the withdrawal decided by the UK.“We have negotiated with the UK, never against the UK. Now it is time for everybody to take their responsibility, everybody.“This deal is a necessary step to build trust between the UK and the EU, we need build in the next phase of this unprecedented and ambitious partnership. We will remain allies, partners and friends.”Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said there were “no political winners or victories” in the Brexit process.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

This is the plan, this is the deal.It is the best deal that could be negotiated under the circumstances and we will be urging all of our colleagues in the House of Commons to vote for it.If this deal is rejected, the EU have made it very clear there is no alternative deal that could be envisaged so therefore we are in no-deal territory.Former leader of the Conservative party Lord Howard told BBC Radio 4\u0027s The World This Weekend that he is backing Ms May and her deal.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s not a deal that is a good deal for the UK in several respects, but the one sticking point that I have relates to the arrangements for leaving the backstop.As members of the European Union we had a unilateral, untrammelled right to leave under Article 50 which we are exercising.Under the backstop arrangements we could only leave with the permission of the European Union.That seems to me to be an absolute negation of taking control, that would put us in a worse position than we are now.At a briefing with Irish media following the special meeting Mr Varadkar said that people should not be focusing on alternative options.Let\u0027s not forget what we have here, we have an agreement that took between 18 months and two years to negotiate, it is in several parts, is over 500 pages long and as of today has the support of 28 governments, he said.He added: Anyone can have a better deal or an alternative deal in their own minds but an agreement 500 pages long that 28 member states can sign up to nobody has that. What\u0027s on the table is the only deal that\u0027s on the table.Leo Varadkar has added that the entire European Union was of the view that the deal could not be renegotiated.It wasn\u0027t easy to get to this point, he said.Mr Varadkar continued: What\u0027s being put in front of EU parliament and House of Commons is a deal. Any other deal really only exists in people\u0027s imagination.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has described the deal as a miserable failure of negotiation.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThis is a bad deal for the country.It is the result of a miserable failure of negotiation that leaves us with the worst of all worlds. It gives us less say over our future, and puts jobs and living standards at risk.That is why Labour will oppose this deal in Parliament. We will work with others to block a no-deal outcome, and ensure that Labour\u0027s alternative plan for a sensible deal to bring the country together is on the table.That includes a permanent customs union with a UK say, a strong single-market deal and guarantees on workers\u0027 rights, consumer and environmental protections.Ms May says her deal delivers on Brexit but protects the United Kingdom.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe ends the press conference by saying this is a deal that is good for the whole of the UK.\u0026nbspAt a press conference in Brussels, Prime Minister Theresa May said: Before Christmas, MPs will vote on this deal.It will be one of the most significant votes that Parliament has held for many years. On it will depend whether we move forward together into a brighter future or open the door to yet more ision and uncertainty.The British people don\u0027t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit.They want a good deal done that fulfils the vote and allows us to come together again as a country.I will take this deal back to the House of Commons, confident we have achieved the best deal available and full of optimism about the future of our country.In Parliament and beyond it, I will make the case for this deal with all my heart and I look forward to that campaign.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load\u0026nbspJean-Claude\u0026nbspJuncker, the president of the European Commission, warned them the agreement was the “only deal possible” and hopes that a better one could be struck were in vain.“Those who think by rejecting the deal that they would have a better deal will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal,” he said.In a veiled plea to MPs\u0026nbspMichel Barnier, Europe’s chief negotiator, called on “everyone to face up to their responsibilities”.Mr\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbspsaid the deal with the UK was a necessary step to advance to the\u0026nbspnext phase of the negotiations.I have worked with my team and negotiated with the UK, never against the UK, he told reporters as he arrived for the summit.Now it is time for everybody to take their responsibility. This deal is a necessary step to build the trust between the UK and the EU we need to build.The next phase is an unprecedented and ambitious partnership.

The Government has suggested that Brexit could potentially be cancelled, or that a chaotic no-deal could take place. Some campaigners have suggested there should be a second referendum, while Labour favours a general election to decide the way forward.Mr Juncker said he would vote for the deal were he a British MP, and said: “I do think that the British parliament, because this is a wise parliament, will ratify this deal.”EU president Juncker says he would vote in favour of May\u0027s Brexit dealTheresa May writes \u0027letter to nation\u0027 insisting Brexit agreement worksEverything you need to know about this weekend\u0027s key Brexit summitHe added: “The UK leaving the EU is a tragic moment.

It is the choice of a sovereign people.”Mr Macron added that Britain’s departure showed the EU had a “fragile” side and was in need of reform. He also pledged that the deal would protect the access of French fishermen to British waters.Chief negotiator Mr Barnier\u0026nbsptold reporters: “All along this extraordinary negotiation, very difficult we have worked to reach a deal. That means to organise in an orderly fashion the withdrawal decided by the UK.“We have negotiated with the UK, never against the UK. Now it is time for everybody to take their responsibility, everybody.“This deal is a necessary step to build trust between the UK and the EU, we need build in the next phase of this unprecedented and ambitious partnership.

The PM has been in Brussels since Saturday afternoon putting the finishing touches to the deal.Among the final hurdles were the issue of Gibraltar. The UK conceded in writing that Spain should have a veto over whether any future trade deal applies to Gibraltar – potentially storing up trouble down the road.

speech.Poulsen and his assistant Peder Oluf Pedersen quickly obtained a patent, their innovation the precursor\u0026nbspto all magnetic tape recorders that would follow.In 1900 Poulsen attended\u0026nbspthe Exposition Universelle in Paris, where he demonstrated his device by recording the voice of Austrian emperor Franz Josef - our earliest surviving magnetic recording - taking home the Grand Prix for his trouble.He followed this breakthrough with the invention of the first continuous wave transmitter in 1903, dubbed the Poulsen\u0026nbspArc, which would be used in the earliest radio broadcasting stations and enabled\u0026nbspcommunication between Lyngby\u0026nbspin the Copehagen suburbs and Newcastle in the UK, effectively bridging the North Sea\u0026nbspwith the aid of\u0026nbsp100-foot masts.The Valdemar Poulsen Gold Medal is awarded each year in his honour by the Danish Academy of Technical Sciences for outstanding research carried out\u0026nbspin the field of radio.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but

This is the people’s disappointment in the DPP,” he said, citing slower-than-expected initiatives that have drawn criticism including pension and justice reforms.Votes were still being counted in Taiwan’s affluent capital, Taipei, where the incumbent mayor Ko Wen-je, an independent, is in a close race with the Kuomintang’s Ting Shou-chung, and the DPP is running a distant third.Kaohsiung’s Kuomintang mayor-elect, Han Kuo-yu, who described the city as “outdated and poor” while on the campaign trail, told a rally he would go all-out to boost its economy.“We must immediately roll up our sleeves and get to work,” Mr Han said, speaking of what was once one of the world’s busiest ports but which has lost much of its business to China.There was no immediate reaction from Beijing to the poll results, where state media simply noted Ms Tsai’s resignation as party chairwoman “to take responsibility for the party’s performance in Taiwan’s local elections”.A spokesperson for the US\u0026nbspState Department praised Taiwan for “demonstrating the strength of their vibrant democratic system through a successful round of elections”.Taiwan television stations reported a high turnout, with some polling stations in parts of Taipei and Kaohsiung remaining open past 4pm (8am GMT) when the polls were due to close.Candidates fanned out across the island to shake hands and canvass votes, and held noisy, colourful rallies that have become the hallmarks of Taiwan’s vibrant democracy, in marked contrast to China where the Communist Party tolerates no dissent to its rule.Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have heightened, with China conducting military drills around the island and snatching away Taiwan’s dwindling number of diplomatic allies.\u0026nbspMs Tsai’s domestic reform initiatives, from the island’s pension scheme to labour law, have also come under intense voter scrutiny recently.Confidence in the government has waned in recent months after reform moves upset both the opposition and some supporters, who said Ms Tsai had backed away from promises to reduce the deficit and cut pollution.Underscoring Ms Tsai’s challenge are a series of public votes also held on Saturday on whether to make same-sex marriage legal, an issue which has deeply ided Taiwan.Voters looked set to back a referendum defining marriage as between and a man and a woman, dealing a sharp blow to Taiwan’s position as a bastion of liberalism in Asia.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from the 2018 Taipei Gay Pride March in Taiwan Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Participants take part in the 2018 Taipei Gay Pride March in Taipei, Taiwan, 27 October 2018.Thousands of people attended the march in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan.Participants walk in the parade.The march took place ahead of a landmark vote next month on LGBT+ rights in Taiwan.On May 24 2017, the Constitutional Court in Taiwan ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry in the state.After making its ruling on same-sex marriage in May last year, the court stated that its decision must be implemented in two years.On November 24, a public vote will be held in Taiwan on same-sex marriage.A participant of the march poses next to a wedding studio.A young woman from Chongqing in mainland China holds a fan reading free writers before the start of the march.Participants with Pikachu-styled costumes pose as they gather at the square outside the presidential office for the start of the march.Thousands took part in the parade in support of same-sex marriage.Participants in the square outside the presidential office before the start of the parade.A couple take part in the march with their baby.Members of Tokyo Rainbow Pride walk in the parade.The parade was awash with rainbow-coloured paraphernalia.A participant of the march poses with a fan.A participant from Japan holds a banner before the start of the march.A person taking part in the march waves a rainbow flag.A man, decorated with balloons and a rainbow flag, takes part in the celebrations.An American man and his Japanese partner, both wearing headbands saying \u0027Japan\u0027 in Japanese, kiss each other during the march.Thousands of people attended the annual march.Taiwan gay rights activist Chi Chia-wei attends the march.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” Irish officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom. Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450259066-e1542730861899.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"true story the innocent man","story":"The scene of the  sex slaying was beyond horric: Debbie had been violated with a ketchup bottle and her crazed killer had scrawled messages all over her body and the walls of her flat using tomato sauce and nail polish.For five years the police failed to garner enough evidence to convict anyone of the murder.Then, in , Ronald Keith Williamson – already in prison for forging bank cheques - was blamed for the horric crime and sentenced to die.But all was not as it seemed.Williamson protested that he didnt do it, and it took  excruciating years on death row before he was eventually exonerated and released.The nightmare crime made for a story which has so many twists and turns that it became the subject of a book by John Grisham, and has now been made into a Netflix series, The Innocent Man, airing on  December.Here, Sun Online takes a closer look at the true story behind the upcoming show.Ron Williamson was born in  in Ada, Oklahoma - the same town as murdered Debbie Carter.He was a natural athlete and excelled at sports, but his primary interest was baseball.After enjoying some early professional success - even playing with the New York Yankees - Williamson’s dream of baseball greatness ended with a shoulder injury that saw himto his hometown at the age of , his career in tatters.No longer a local hero, Williamson was dogged by failure and fell into a deep depression, living at his mother’s house and sleeping up to  hours a day.He was soon diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but he was never given proper treatment and self-medicated with drugs and alcohol.The downward spiral continued until his le finally hit an even more desperate low in  - on a night when Debbie Carter worked her sht as a waitress at Coachlight, a bar which Williamson frequently went to.After the murder was discovered, police interviewed Glen Gore, another customer at the Coachlight that evening, and he claimed he had seen Williamson arguing with Carter that evening.The police were also told that murdered Debbie Carter had revealed to a friend that Williamson, “made her nervous”.Police quickly identied Williamson as a suspect, along with his friend Dennis Fritz. Neither were able to provide an alibi for the evening, as they couldn’t remember where they’d been.Williamson agreed to take two polygraph tests, both of which came up as “inconclusive”.Without any physical evidence, a confession, or solid circumstantial evidence, Williamson was released and the case went cold for five years until Williamson ended up in Pontotoc County Jail in Ada, awaiting trial for forged cheques.There, an inmate named Terri Holland claimed the usually reserved and quiet Williamson confessed to her he’d murdered Debbie Carter.Police exhumed the body of Debbie Carter in May of  and arrested Williamson’s friend Fritz who also happened to be caught – on tape – confessing the murder to a cellmate.Hairs found at the scene were then analysed by the forensic chemist lab in Oklahoma City and were found to match both suspects and they were charged with the murder.Williamson, at this point, was still in a dire mental state.He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia in addition to his prior battles with bipolar disorder and depression.“Untreated, unmedicated, Ron was charged with capital murder,” Grisham said in , hinting at the gross injustice of the case.Denied access to medication by prison guards, Williamson became, “a wild man” at the trial.Scared and exasperated, he started shouting and screaming his innocence at the judge and jury.But his pleas didnt help his case the jury convicted him of murder and the judge sentenced him to die.Appeals were fruitless.It was only after Williamson had spent  years on death row in Oklahoma, and with only five days until his scheduled execution, on September , , that the judge issued a stay that made it possible for Williamson to be exonerated and take his le back.With the help of a new legal team, Williamson was moved to a treatment area for mental patients, where doctors finally concluded he was completely unstable.His new team of lawyers argued that Mr. Williamson had not been competent to stand trial and his lawyer had not effectively challenged the hair evidence or sought other suspects.In , Williamson underwent DNA testing that proved his innocence beyond a doubt and on April , , he and Fritz were completely cleared of all guilt.DNA evidence, meanwhile, matched Glenn Glore – the main eyewitness for the State at Williamson’s trial who helped to convict him – as the true murderer.Fritz and Williamson filed a civil lawsuit accusing the Pontotoc County district attorney and other defendants — including the city of Ada, the state of Oklahoma, Gore, and county police officers — of engineering “a  case that consisted of faulty forensic evidence.They also said this included fictitious confessions reported by jailhouse snitches with overwhelming motives to lie, in addition to the self-serving lies of the actual murderer.”Williamson and Fritz settled the suit and both men received an undisclosed sum of money.The spring after their release, Williamson and Fritz visited New York, where they took a tour of Yankee Stadium.Williamson said at that time that he was just getting a taste of how much fun they were having up here.”Sadly, just five years later, on December , , Williamson died in an Oklahoma nursing home, surrounded by his family after being diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver.He was  - and had spent over a fth of his entire le behind bars, waiting to be killed, for a crime he didnt commit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But that’s a price Brussels will surely pay to cripple us as a trading rival on their doorstep.That said, the deal is NOT all bad.Downing Street rightly trumpets that it ends free movement and our massive membership subscription, protects jobs and secures our fishing rights .And Mrs May, to her considerable credit, pushed the EU into an extraordinary U-turn over a high-tech solution to police the Irish border. Remember how glibly they once sneered at that idea Trouble is, who trusts them not to change heart againthe appalling “Irish backstop” alternative suits them The trade deal may take years. Anyone could veto it: Spain over Gibraltar. Or the Belgian Walloons who almost wrecked the EU Canada deal. We would be stuck.And while Mrs May’s deal enshrines our right to an independent trade policy, it also says any new partnership with the EU must “build on” a single customs territory.That’s why Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab quit — it ­scuppers any deals where.The one straw we clutch is that Jeremy Corbyn isn’t negotiating.None of his scripted lines, nor his brow furrowed in supposed concentration, can hide that the entire debate sails over his head.Don’t imagine the chaos couldn’t be worse.WE heartily approve of primary kids being tasked with damming streams, canoeing and playing conkers.Sure, it’s a bit Swallows And Amazons.

Im going to make sure thatwe need to make changes to support them then we will.Research has shown that single mums and women generally are some of the hardest hit by the Universal Credit and welfare system.The flagship policy, which is set to roll six benefits into one, has been beset with issues, but the new DWP boss has vowed to fix them.She insisted that the system was a force for good but admitted there were real problems that needed to be dealt with.Millions more Brits are set to go onto the new system in the coming months, as ministers transfer people from the old to the new system.Yesterday MPs demanded it be put back while ministers fix the problems with the scheme as it stands.Influential politicians on the Work and Pensions Committee demanded extra payments for those transferring over, a scrapping of the five week wait for people already on benefits, and moves to try and transfer vulnerable people over automatically.Ms Rudd said she wanted to make sure women are protected and have access to split paymentsthey are in domestic abuse relationships.She said: We need to give [claimants] more confidence in the fact that they can access cash immediately.You know people are nervous about moving from legacy benefits to Universal Credit because they cannot afford quite often to be without cash for a few days, a week, two weeks, three weeks.I have to make sure that they can have confidence in access in earlier.Ms Rudd said in the Commons earlier this week she would talk to the Treasury about extra cash for the department.Chancellor Philip Hammond revealed a package of measures in last months Budget to help those on Universal Credit - with a multibillion pound programme.Brits will be able to keep £ of what they earn and will get help with extra payments and debt management, but those arent set to come in for years.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord.

These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments.

You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.The current scheme is running five years behind schedule, and now wont cost any less than the old one.Brits have said it is pushing them into debt and some are struggling to survive - with one woman even saying she was forced to take £ for sex work while she waited.Yesterday a man who had his payments slashed said he was made to live on pasta and gravy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead, everyone in the city simply relieved themselves into channels which carried the sewage to the Thames where, at low tide, it was six feet deep on the banks.The smell was unbearable and so was the disease. Thousands and thousands died every week from cholera and typhus.But then, on an early incarnation of ­Toilet Day, someone decided to build ­sewers and an embankment keeping the Thames and the city apart.And after all that was done, the death toll fell to just about zero.World Toilet Day then sounds like it should be a joke.

That’s nearly half a ­BILLION in two years.Even the Tories were cross, with one MP saying that no one in the country should be allowed to earn more than a million a year.Well, let’s think about that shall we Mrs Coates, who started the business herself, has donated more than £million to ious charities. She’s helped the victims of cancer, typhoons and even gave £, to a school in Stoke so they could help youngsters in Sierra Leone.She sounds to me like a very sound, very big-hearted and very good woman.And then there’s the small matter of how much tax she pays.As she still lives here, quietly, in Cheshire, it’ll be around  per cent of what she earns.Which means in the past two years, she’ll have given the Treasury about £million.That’s one taxpayer coughing up enough to build eight secondary schools.Which means she’s done a damn site more for the country and the world than some bitter and twisted MP who just wants to get her name in the papers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Securing a general election is the only thing that matters to them.Jeremy Corbyn is showing scant regard for statesmanship and putting our country’s best interests a poor second to sheer tribal and selfish ambition.I will tell you one thing about Theresa May: No one can say she is putting herself through this for personal political ambition.Hers has been a tormented week of continued public duty and personal, selfless service.Stoic and steadfast, the Prime Minister has shown a resilience seen rarely in politics, probably last admired when another woman ran the country.The stance of Arlene Foster’s DUP is carelessly irresponsible in the extreme.A lot of the “backstop” stuff and the — unacceptable in my view — possibility of the EU being able to block our exit, has been caused by a bona fide effort from May to accommodate the DUP’s wishes.For me, it has been an interesting week in another way as well.I have presided over the board meetings of several of the six private companies I have the honour to chair.Dferent sizes, dferent sectors, dferent parts of the country, yet they are all saying the same things. That business is doing fine. Not what the doomsayers want to hear, but true. It is hard work but certainly not Armageddon.Companies up and down the land are demanding a diet of “boring, stable predictability”. It means they can invest more cash and employ more people. It is uncertainty that kills us.I am hearing from boardrooms that the Brexit proposal is fine, with one big caveat.On the plus side, a Single Market for manufactured goods will work.Anyone selling into the EU — yes, even China and Trump’s USA — has to abide by EU regulation.“Taking it” from Berlin, er, Brussels in this area is not a problem whatever ideologues may say. It secures hundreds of thousands of jobs and tax revenues.The proposed deal means business will be free to recruit essential immigrant labour on the basis of their skill and not where they come from.Choosing from a global, not just an EU, pool of talent is so, so helpful and will assist our international competitiveness hugely.But the one message ringing through my ears is, “Get on with it.”Regardless of whether a business is in Birmingham or Barcelona, Sunderland or Stuttgart, the wealth-creators of Europe, the payers of the tax that builds schools and hospitals, the job-providers just want their politicians to stop this rowing now.Stop the bullying, Berlin stop the rowing, Tories stop the naked, tribal, selfish manoeuvring, Labour — and just do it.One big caveat: You cannot expect anyone in our country — businesswoman or a guy on the line alike — to accept a deal that gives Jean-Claude Juncker’s lot the final say on when, indeed,we leave. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team have bullied us enough.While there are a million dferent beliefs on what the majority of Brits voted for in the referendum, one thing is certain: They DID vote to leave.Giving the EU the final yes no on that is unacceptable and surely no deal is better than that.No deal means no £billion to the unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats. No deal means fewer jobs in troubled Germany and faltering France.Yes, it would be harder for UK business for sure. But not fatal. There would be a price to pay, but whoever said freedom does not come at a price There was one other thing businesses were clear on at my meetings last week.The quicker this country understands there is a greater threat to prosperity, jobs, tax revenues and a successful economy than Brexit, the better.A Corbyn government would turn this country into Venezuela in short order talent and capital would leave so quickly that John McDonnell would have nothing left punitively to tax.The message from small business is as clear as it is strong.The Conservatives, Liberals, big business and the establishment must stop obsessing about Brexit and focus on the greatest threat this country has faced for decades.And that is a bunch of extreme hard-Left business-haters who would ruin this great country and probably blame their abject failure on Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard. Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Great-grandad Brian, an RAF veteran and former cabbie, has won a major gong for his punctuality, reliability and cheerful attitude. He started delivering curries three years ago after his we Margaret died and he has no plans to put his feet up. Brian – believed to be the oldest person in the country doing the job – said: “People think I should be sitting back watching telly but that’s not me. “I like to go out and about and meet people, not sit at home and stagnate. “People wonder how I still manage to run around delivering curries, but I feel just as fit as when I was . I’ll only retire when I get old enough.”  Brian started working for Kipling’s restaurant in Sowerby Bridge, near Halax, West Yorks, almost by chance. He was already known for going door to door with Yellow Pages and the restaurant askedhe could deliver menus. One night when he popped in for some a driver had rung in sick so he was askedhe could deliver meals too. Brian said: “So I said yes. That’s what I do. When someone says, ‘Can you do this for me ’ I’ll say yes and do it to the best of my ability. I’m lucky to be here and I want to make the most of my le.” Dad-of-four Brian was a senior aircraftman with the RAF in the s, serving as an air traffic controller during the volatile Suez Crisis. Later he worked as a TV engineer and then spent  years as a taxi driver – which taught him the streets of Halax so well he doesn’t need a satnav. His only fear is dogs after being bitten by an Alsatian and a cocker spaniel while delivering Yellow Pages.  He joked: “But I know I’m safe when I’m doing my takeaway deliveries shybecause the dogs won’t bite someone who’s bringing in food.” During last winter’s big Beast from the East freeze Brian, who drives his own car, came across a woman stranded in the snow with her young daughter. Their car had broken down and their phone was dead so Brian gave them a lt home. It was only as he was dropping them off he discovered it was the same address he was delivering to. The husband was initially angry that his food had taken so long to arrive – until he realised Brian had brought his we and child home safely. Last week Brian had a “fabulous” trip to The Savoy Hotel in London for the Just Eat British Takeaway Awards hosted by TV star David Walliams. He was crowned Best Delivery Driver to a standing ovation – and the delight of Kipling’s boss Mohammed Rafiq and manager Max Rehman, who were at the ceremony with him. Mohammed said: “Brian is irreplaceable and a great role model to others.

But what exactly does a Duchess carry around with her when shes out and about on official royal duties  There has been a lot of speculation over the years about what the Queen keeps in her bag, but now a royal author has revealed what Kate keeps in hers. In her book Kate: A Biography, Marcia Moody claims Kate only carries four things with her - and theyre all very practical.  The first item is a staple in most womens handbags - a compact mirror, reports MamaMia. Perfect for checking shes ready for all the cameras before she arrives at an event. Next is lipbalm. While most might expect her to have a lipstick in her bag, she carries lip balm instead. Which might be why we never see her with dry lips! Kate also reportedly always carries blotting paper, which is normally used to take care of excess oil or sweat on the face. Again, this could be very useful when making sure shes ready to meet important people or to smile for the cameras.  The final item is a handkerchief. When shes off duty and out and about with the kids, Kate is normally carrying a much bigger bag so probably has lots of other bits and bobs. We assume that, like most parents, she carries all the essentials little George, Charlotte and Louis might need for a fun day out.

But the woman in the pictures was really US porn star Briana Lee, , whose photo has been lted repeatedly by cheats for this very purpose. Grandad Simon turned to internet dating after his we of  years left him. He joined a website called Real Sex Contacts in February  and two months later was introduced to Eva, supposedly a hospital worker from Ghanaian capital Accra. She sent a picture, Simon fell in love and he was persuaded to part with more than pound,.   In an exchange of messages she even teased out information about his bank cards. But when the time came for them to meet in the UK in August this year, Eva didn’t show up and he has not heard from her since. Simon, from Soham, Cambs, said he was speaking out to stop others falling for the same scam. He said: “I genuinely believed the relationship was real. I don’t understand why anyone would treat me like that. I had good intentions and was looking for a genuine relationship. “It has put me off trying anything like this ever again. “I would rather be lonely than go through all of this trauma.” Simon said he and Eva had called each other “babe” and “husband” and talked of buying a house for a new le together.

Simon said: “I was sold a complete sob story and was completely used. “I believed everything she said. I thought I’d be able to clear my debts and we’d be able to enjoy the money and buy a house together. “But she clearly had no intention of coming here. I was lonely, and I still am, and I was looking for company. Eva seemed genuine. But I was shyobviously an easy target.” The loans come with a huge  per cent interest rate and Simon now needs to pay pound a month for two years to clear his debts. His bank account is locked following suspicions over his transfers to Ghana – so his daughter is having to pay his bills. Diabetic Simon was so stressed that he contemplated suicide.

Yesterday it emerged that Harry and we Meghan would be moving out of Kensington Palace and would set up home on the Frogmore estate, amid reports of a rt with Prince William. The Duke and Duchess of Susex will move into the -bedroom home, near Windsor Castle, to raise a family in a quieter setting. But one royal source has suggested the move could be down to friction between Meghan and Kate which has driven wedge between the two brothers. Kate and Meghan are very dferent people. They dont really get on, an insider told the Daily Mail. Meghans Hollywood persona has shaken up the royal family but some claim it has upset the balance in the household.  Meghan and Kate appeared to be the closest of pals on occasions when they have ventured out in public together. They clapped and cheered together as they watched Serena Williams play Angelique Kerber at the Ladies Wimbledon Final earlier this year. Some observers have noted that Kate has caught the Meghan Markle bug after she was pictured hugging children during a rare break from tradition at an event in Essex. It appeared the Duchess of Cambridge had taken a leaf out of her touchy-feely sisters-in-laws book and has become more hands on with well-wishers.  It is claimed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had planned to move into one of Kensington Palaces main apartments, next to William and Kate, but there has been a bit of tension between the brothers. A royal source told The Sun : The initial plan was for Harry and Meghan to move out of their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace and into one of the main apartments. But there has been a bit of tension between the brothers.  Now Harry and Meghan don’t want to live next to William and Kate and want to strike out on their own. They need more room and hope Frogmore Cottage will be ready in time for when they have the baby. Frogmore Cottage is a gt from the Queen to Harry, , and Meghan,  and the property will be given a taxpayer-funded makeover in time for the couple to move in.  A royal statement said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will move to Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate early next year as they prepare for the arrival of their first child. The couple have lived at Nottingham Cottage since their engagement last year. Windsor is a very special place for Their Royal Highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate. The Duke and Duchess’s office will continue to be based at Kensington Palace.  Earlier this year it was reported that the Queen warned Prince Harry about dficult Meghans attitude after a row over about what tiara she could wear on her wedding day. Bride-to-be Meghan wished to wear a tiara with emeralds but was refused after its origins could not be established. The -year-old eventually wore a diamond and platinum headpiece selected by the Queen, despite Harry, , telling staff previously “what Meghan wants, Meghan gets”. The claim was made in Robert Jobsons new book, Charles at Seventy.

The couple will swap their two-bedroom cottage at Kensington Palace for a Grade II-listed -bedroom pad near Windsor Castle, officials confirmed. Speculation had grown that “a bit of tension” between Harry and brother William was behind the move. But the Sunday Mirror can reveal there is no brotherly falling-out, with royal sources rubbishing the claims. The switch by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex is down to their wish for more space in preparation for their new arrival.It is believed both want a wing at their next home for Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland,  – who aims to be a hands-on gran to her first grandchild in visits from Los Angeles.  The pair will move from Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace to Frogmore Cottage half a mile south of Windsor Castle. A source said: “With a baby on the way, there wasn’t the option of the Duke and Duchess staying at the palace as Nottingham Cottage is tiny and none of the bigger apartments is available. “Doria will be staying with them for quite long periods and they need a larger place.” Frogmore Cottage is a gt from the Queen to Harry, , and Meghan, .The pair had their engagement photos taken there and hosted their wedding reception in it last May. It lies on the Frogmore estate, has a gym and yoga studio and is said to be undergoing a multi-million-pound refit funded by taxpayers.  The royal source said: “Frogmore Cottage isn’t massive but it’s certainly big enough for Doria to have a separate area there.” William and his we Kate live in a -bedroom apartment at Kensington Palace. Ex-social worker Doria was the only member of her family to attend Meghan’s wedding. She captured Britain’s heart as she choked back tears watching Prince Charles walk her daughter down the aisle in place of Meghan’s dad Thomas, who could not travel for health reasons. Doria spent much of the summer with Harry and Meghan in the UK and was described by her son-in-law as “amazing”. The source added: “The couple are bound to have a pad somewhere in Kensington Palace but Frogmore Cottage will be their main base. “It’s not too far from London in terms of getting to royal engagements. Their office and staff will stay at Kensington.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mummy 3000 year old woman","story":"NewsMummy of ,-year-old woman found perfectly preserved inside coffin in EgyptThe ancient coffin was one of two discovered in El-Asasef, Luxor, on the bank of the River Nile, by Egyptian authoritiesShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video moment-archaeologists-open-yo-coffin-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mummy of a woman found almost perfectly preserved inside a coffin in Egypt dating back more than , years was unveiled today. The ancient coffin, called a sarcophagus, was one of two discovered in El-Asasef, Luxor, on the bank of the River Nile. And today authorities had for the first time opened a previously unopened sarcophagus before international media. One sarcophagus was rishi-style, which dates back to the th dynasty, while the other sarcophagus was from the th dynasty. The two tombs were present with their mummies inside, Egypts Minister of Antiquities Khaled Al Anani said. The Eighteenth Dynasty dates back to the th century BC, a period noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs, including Tutankhamen.  The team of French researchers started the excavation in March, stopped in May but resumed work in August. They also found five coloured masks and more than , Ushabti statutes in another tomb nearby. Ushabti statutes are miniature figurine of servants to serve the dead in the afterle. More than  metres of rubble were removed over five months to uncover the tomb, which contained coloured ceiling paintings depicting the owner and his family.  The tomb, which also contains mummies, skeletons and skulls, dates back to the middle-kingdom almost , years ago, but was reused during the late period. Ancient Egyptians mummied humans to preserve their bodies for the afterle, while animal mummies were used as religious offerings.

Billie-Jo Robinson has said she wasnt seen by any medical professionals and was left lying on a cold airport floor at am in the morning after being removed from the flight from JFK airport to Manchester last Saturday. The -year-old, who had been on holiday with her sister-in-law and a friend, said passengers were left waiting to board the plane for more than two hours, during which time she began to feel unwell and needed a sick bag. But she claimed that soon afterwards she was told by a cabin crew member that the airlines ground staff doctor and deemed her not fit to fly. Billie, who is  weeks pregnant and from the Wirral, said she was told to get off the flight and was left until the early hours of the morning with no money, food or accommodation.  She told The Liverpool Echo : We were left waiting on the plane for ages because of missing passengers. It was really hot and I had really bad heartburn after having a McDonalds in the airport and felt a bit sick. I saw an air hostess with sick bags and asked her for one, and I was sick a little bit - but not enough to leave my seat. I asked the air hostess could she get rid of the bag and she asked was I okay, to which I said I was fine and she gave me a bottle of water. It had been about  minutes since I had been sick and I was just sat reading my magazine when a member of the cabin crew came up to me and said I needed to get off the aircraft. She said a doctor on the ground, who had never even met me or seen me, had made the decision I was not fit to fly. A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said the decision was made after the situation was evaluated with independent medical experts. Billie, a childrens home manager who is due to give birth in April, said she was reassured by staff she would be put up in a hotel, taken to the hospital to get a doctors note and then put on the next flight. But she claims that she, her friend and her sister-in-law were left until am on a cold airport floor with only  and travel cards between them.  Billie said: I was crying when I was told to get off the flight but I was told by the cabin crew not to worry, Virgin will take me to the hospital to get a fit to fly letter, sort us a hotel and food, until the next flight we can be booked onto. However, when we got off the flight I was told to go and collect our luggage, which was a  minute walk away, and then drag a kg case across the airport, up escalators. Bear in mind Im too sick to fly and need to go to hospital. Our other case which has the only bank card in didnt come off the plane and when we went to the customer services desk they said they couldnt find it. And then we were told we wouldnt be going to a hotel or hospital and I needed to sort it myself because it wasnt their responsibility. After hours of trying to resolve the situation, Billie and the group were eventually given a hotel and a hospital visit was arranged via their travel insurance for later the same day. However, later that morning Billie said she was contacted by the airlines duty manager and told she had been booked on another flight and didnt need a doctors note. The group were then flown from JFK to Atlanta and then on to Manchester. Billie said: I want an apology and an explanation as to why I was kicked off the flight. I want to know what information the on the ground doctor was told to say I was not fit to fly.

The vile attack on two cops in South London last Saturday was a case in point.Both officers needed hospital treatment for their injuries. The WPC had head injuries and her male colleague had a broken rib. So far, so shocking. But what made me gasp in shydisbelief was the realisation that a member of the public had whipped out his mobile phone and – rather than call  – had filmed the whole thing, along with what he imagined to be a jokey commentary, and then posted it online. “Oh, dear me,” chuckled the bystander. “He just kung fu-kicked her in the head! Look! I am getting this all live, boys and girls, I thought I’d just stop and have a little watch.” The poor policewoman was kicked so hard in the head she fell into the path of a passing bus and narrowly escaped being run over. Several arrests have been made and we are now waiting for justice to be done. But one person who won’t be in the dock any time soon is the moron who stood by and watched this carnage unfold asit were an episode of Line of Duty, asreal people weren’t being hurt and real lives weren’t at stake. Because apparently, he didn’t break any laws.  This is now something our emergency services are expected to just put up with. Asit weren’t traumatic enough to be the first responders to a horrible accident, or a killing or a suicide, they have to deal with idiots who think these are appropriate images to share on social media. So I’m not a bit surprised at the sad comments made by the Met Police Federation Chairman, Ken Marsh, who said that Britain’s “walk on by culture” had led him to conclude that officers might have to let violent thugs go free rather than even attempt to arrest them. This reminded me of a situation I was caught up in a few years ago. My husband Steve and I were on a bus travelling into town. It was a busy Saturday afternoon and the bus was packed with people. When it arrived at our stop we stood up to get off and right in front of our eyes a man grabbed the female driver, snatched her takings and ran down the street. Before I had a chance to even take a breath, Steve had leapt off the bus and chased the thief down the street, yelling: “Stop that man! Stop that man.”After a y chase, in which no one  lted a finger to help, he caught the man who dropped the cash and then fled when Steve stopped to pick it up. Fortunately, the police turned up at that point and arrested the thief. My point isn’t that my husband was a hero. It’s that his reaction to help was instinctive. He didn’t even think about it. And until recently I believed that most of us thought that way. Butthat attitude is dying out we need to think about adopting the sort of good Samaritan Law they have in Germany and many other European countries. In Germany it is a crime not to help others in danger and those found guilty can be fined or jailed for up to a year. And for those who compound the crime by posting evidence of their heartlessness on social media we should double the sentence. Let’s see how many “likes” they get then.

Scientists have said that we sprang from a solitary pair of adults - who lived , to , years ago - after a catastrophic event almost wiped out the entire human race. The findings were made by scientists who surveyed the genetic bar codes of five million animals - including humans - from , dferent species. And its not just humans who came from a single pair of beings - these bar codes, or snippets of DNA that reside outside the nuclei of living cells, suggest that nine out of every  animal species do, too.  According to the Bible, Adam and Eve were chosen to be the first people to live on Earth and were the first parents. The research was led by Senior Research Associate Mark Stoeckle and Research Associate David Thaler of the University of Basel, Switzerland, , Mail Online reports. They concluded that % of all animal species alive today come from parents that all began giving birth at roughly the same time, less than  thousand years ago - throwing into doubt the patterns of human evolution. This conclusion is very surprising, Thaler admitted, and I fought against it as hard as I could. Dr Stoeckle said: At a time when humans place so much emphasis on inidual and group dferences, maybe we should spend more time on the ways in which we resemble one another and the rest of the animal kingdom.  The new report from experts at the Rockefeller University along with from the University of Basel published the extraordinary findings in Human Evolution. They mined big data insights from the worlds fast-growing genetic databases and reviewed a large literature in evolutionary theory, including Darwin. The conclusions throw up considerable mystery as to why the need for human le to start again was needed such a relatively short time ago.  The last known extinction we know of was during the time of the dinosaurs  million years ago - opening up the possibility of an inbuilt human evolutionary process wherein we break down and die out, leaving the need to start from scratch. Humans are also surprisingly similar to not just every other human, but every other species. If a Martian landed on Earth and met a flock of pigeons and a crowd of humans, one would not seem more erse than the other according to the basic measure of mitochondrial DNA, said Jesse Ausubel, Director of the Program for the Human Environment at The Rockefeller University. Culture, le experience and other things can make people very dferent but in terms of basic biology, were like the birds, Dr Stoeckle added.  The mitochondrial DNA examined in the research is that which mothers pass down from generation to generation and it showed the absence of human exceptionalism. One might have thought that, due to their high population numbers and wide geographic distribution, humans might have led to greater genetic ersity than other animal species, added Stoeckle. At least for mitochondrial DNA, humans turn out to be low to average in genetic ersity. The study has been misunderstood by some religious parties who thought it meant that we all came into being in some seminal Big Bang-type event , ago, but this isnt what the findings actually suggest. What Stoeckle and Thalers findings point to is that our species has to revamp far more often than we thought, and we do so in unison with all animals.

I’ve been very pleased with what we’ve seen from him so far.”Curran’s role has changed under the new manager after previous boss Neil McCann wanted to develop him into an attacking full-back.McIntyre, though, sees him further up the pitch where he can use his pace to hurt opposing teams more directly.Also able to play as a central midfielder, Curran’s versatility has its uses for a manager but Jim has urged the young Aussie to “nail down a position” to really fulfil the potential he sees in him.The Dens boss said: “I see him playing further forward rather than right-back, though I know he can play there. He has that athleticism you need to play full-back, wing-back as well but I think you can get goals out of him.“He’s versatile but I think sometimes with players you need to nail down a position so we’re trying to do that with Jesse.“But I definitely see him in the midfield area.”Curran is expected to continue in that right-wing role for the Dark Blues at Hibs on Saturday despite having fit-again Roarie Deacon as competition.The former Sutton United man missed the draw with St Mirren with a thigh strain but trained this week and is available.Sven-Goran Eriksson wants Dundee youngster Jesse Curran\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp sven-goran-eriksson-wants-dundee-youngster-jesse-curran embed # secretxcPQdfeTm\" data-secret\"xcPQdfeTm\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Sven-Goran Eriksson wants Dundee youngster Jesse Curran# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bf3f4dff169b-e1542721422611.jpg ","title":"no parking bus at hibees for dundee","story":"Jim McIntyre has no plans to park the bus this coming weekend as his Dundee side travel to free-scoring Hibs in the Premiership.The Dark Blues have the leakiest defence in the ision while the Hibees have notched  in five league matches at Easter Road ahead of their clash on Saturday.The Dens gaffer is under no illusions how tough it will be against Neil Lennon’s side, though he’s seen encouragement from his side over the past couple of matches.And he’s planning to put their opponents “under pressure” as his side aim for a much-needed result.He said: “Things were taken on from the Motherwell game and things were more positive with the St Mirren performance and it’s about trying to turn small margins into points.“We know we are facing a top side in Hibs who have done a fantastic job this season, are an exciting team to watch and have a lot of attacking threat but we have to go there and put them under pressure.”Of late, however, the Hibees haven’t won in their last four – but that recent form won’t change how Dundee prepare.“You are going to have peaks and troughs through any season but I’m sure them being at home Lenny will have them fired up,” added Jim.“We know they have good players and will be looking to take maximum points but from our own end the encouraging signs have been there and we want to try to build on the St Mirren result.“The boys clearly know how I work now after a month.

locally for sale.From July to October, Tams hosts its stalls on Friday and Saturdays in the two parks.Established in , it sells excess seasonal fresh and allotment-grown fruit and vegetables in Aberdeen, with the aim of reducing waste and food miles and helping to improve the environment.It is thought the community greengrocer would be situated in Rosemount, as there is already a thriving number of independent stores and cafes in the area.Cath Pillie, one of the organisers at Tams, said: “What we do is we sell the excess fruit and vegetables from allotments.“It would be really goodwe could get local fruit and vegetables.“There isn’t a dedicated greengrocer, so we thought we would try to do something about that and seeit’s something that people wanted.”Organisers have been asking people who visit the stalls whether it is something they would like to see – and have received positive feedback so far.The survey asks whether residents live in the Rosemount area andthey buy their food there.It goes on to ask what members of the public would like to buy more of in general, including options such as a good iety of fruit and vegetables, whole foods such as nuts, pulses and grains, locally-made preserves, gluten-free bread and vegan foods.It also asks how often residents shop for food and the times they were most likely to go to the store.Cath added: “So far we have had more than  forms filled in and the majority of people think it’s a great idea.“We want to continue it to see what people think.“There did used to be a greengrocer there, but it’s been gone for a long time now.“There’s been a resurgence in people wanting fresh and locally-grown fruit and vegetables lately.”Cath added that many people are also now vegetarian and vegan, which makes it the ideal time to look at opening the greengrocer.It would be run entirely by the community, with a number of staff and volunteers.She said: “There’s a similar place in Edinburgh called Dig In and it does really well.“We’ve been in contact with them, they’ve been really helpful.”Tams is in place in Seaton Park every Friday between am and pm.It also visits the David Welch Winter Gardens in Duthie Park from .am

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.

It will be deal or no deal.I wonrsquot pretend the deal is perfect.No-one gets everything they want in a negotiation ndash and wersquove had two years of tough negotiations with the EU.So the deal is a compromise.If between now and the final vote in Parliament we learn the deal does not deliver everything wersquove promised our fishing industry, Irsquoll not be able to support it.And the same goes for Northern Ireland.I need to be sure the so-called backstop plan does not threaten the integrity of the UK by creating fundamentally dferent, permanent arrangements for Northern Ireland.But Irsquom encouraged those risks have been avoided because itrsquos clear the arrangements focus on the specic circumstances in Northern Ireland ndash the need to honour the Belfast Agreement and maintain the fragile peace process, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland. One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick High School and Selkirk High School were given C ratings, while Peebles High School was deemed to have a B, or good,

industry caused alarm among would-be investors.A Spark spokesman said that the company is still working to merge the parent firm and its workforce with a larger provider.ldquoIf successful, it would mean Spark becomes a standalone part of this large independent supplier ndash operating from our offices in Selkirk, Edinburgh and Horsham offices, supplying our customers under the new parent

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

issues, against a background of half-truths and disinformation.Remember the £ million on the side of a bus and spending irregularities There was no clear idea of what Brexit actually meant, with those campaigning for leave promoting often contradictory views.The electorate was  presented with a blank sheet of paper, acting on blind faith as to what Brexit meant.The Scottish independence referendum

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"long-serving-coach-driver-retires-after-30-years","story":"Tranent man Alec Napier, who turned  on October , said he was looking forward to le in the slow lane.ldquoIrsquoll be taking it easy and letting someone  do the driving, said Alec.ldquoIrsquove stayed in lots of nice, and some not-so-nice, hotels in my time.

My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

North Berwick is there are quite a lot of concerns about the Edington [Hospital] and The Abbey [care home] being reprovisioned and there are a lot of planning applications that people are concerned about.ldquoIn terms of the community council, we have quite a few vacancies to fillbut I think that will be a short-term issue.Miss Lockhart, who works as an internal auditor, was keen to see those

ago.Planning applications for housing development on some of the land, which was initially set aside for business development by the council, have gone ahead as Sirius Sport argued that the housing was needed in order to fund the stadium.However, the spectre of the stadium has also led to campaigns by anti-greyhound racing campaigners to stop it being built.Last year, Sirius Sport received

originally been turned down by East Lothian Council but that decision was overturned by the Scottish Government and they were ordered to give it the go-ahead.Concerns that none of the houses planned were affordable were raised however, Iain McFarlane, the councilrsquos head of planning, said at the time the reason the houses were all ldquohigh-end was because they were designed to raise the finance for the stadium and without them the project would not be viable.Now East Lothian Council has asked the firm to provide an update on its plans as it prepares to move forward with its Local Development Plan, which has set aside land for up to , new houses in the county in the years ahead.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoIn relation to ongoing developments in the

It is a problem we have got to deal with.If there is a way of doing it without having to use lights, I think that would be the better option.Any preferred plan would need to win the approval of Transport Scotland.Mr Hampshire added: ldquoIt is in the early stages and there is still a lot of work to be done, both by transportation officers and planning to develop that.The idea of improving the junction comes as plans to improve nearby Sherfhall Roundabout, which connects the bypass, A and A, have been given the go-ahead.

I realised I didnrsquot know quite where to start. The feeling of inclusiveness, the uncontaminated landscapes, the astonishing beauty of cities like Edinburgh and the thriving cultural hub of Glasgow, all of these make a person who lands on Scottish soil feel welcomed into a special place.There are so many driving factors that bring people to Scotland and leave a permanent imprint in their minds. There is a good reason why the country was voted as top destination by travel publisher Rough Guides in  ndash it just has so much to offer. But how do the most popular tourist attractions shape up  I set out to find out.National Museum of ScotlandChambers St, Edinburgh EH JFFree www.nms.ac.ukIf someone were to think of a Scottish remake of A Night at The Museum with a sci-fi feel, then the National Museum would be the ideal setting. Besides a rich collection of curiosities from the Victorian age and archaeological relics, it has a scientic section with working models of engines and machines that would wake anybodyrsquos inner child.A solemn Victorian building on the outside, it hides a labyrinth within its walls, at whose heart is a bright and wide central hall connecting all the other sections and a laid-back cafe. Free tours run every day. What I found outstanding, besides the breadth and iety of the permanent exhibitions, ranging from scientic achievement to art and world cultures, is its interactivity and its aim to be a hub for culture and development: the cafes and other spaces where people can sit, relax and explore it bit by bit ndash or just use it as a meeting point. I loved its originality the rooftop, for instance, not only offers a spectacular view on the Old Town and the surroundings, but is also a small botanical garden with historical and geographical information. The section on New Scots is also a reflection of the countryrsquos propensity to embrace foreign cultures. I believe there could be more information provided in foreign languages, so that people whose English is not incredibly fluent could enjoy the exhibits even more. The collections stand up well in comparison to other museums in Europes capital cities.Vote:  Edinburgh CastleCastlehill, Edinburgh EH NGTickets on sitepound poundThe iconic building is like a gem encrusted on top of a hill, watching over the city from above. A very well preserved inner area hosts so many dferent museums and areas of interest it reminded me of a Russian doll ndash there is always something new to discover, a new corner with a dferent, stunning view on the Old Town. Yet its interior, which is rich in detail, is not over-designed, and renovations are good enough not to look, as often happens, like a bad copy of the original. However, despite creating one of the most stunning urban landscapes I have seen around Europe, I have to admit it was not love at first sight when I visited one of the UKrsquos highest rated locations. High season can lead to queuing for around  minutes, battered by rain and chilly wind, for a ticket that was not what I would call cheap. Whereas I understand such a building requires funds to keep running, it is one of the most expensive attractions I have been to. I also find that the absence of a student or young people discount is unfortunate, although discounts are available for children, families, senior citizens and the unemployed. Information around the castle grounds is basic unless the visitor decides to pay for an audio guide . These are well made and available in a very good iety of languages. Staff are present all around the castle and are ready to help visitors. Edinburgh Castle is a magnicent piece of history, however, they should work on their prices.Vote:  Scottish National GalleryThe Mound, Edinburgh EH ELFree With a Da Vinci masterpiece welcoming you as you step into the first exhibition hall, entering the Scottish National Gallery is like walking into a pantheon of myths. A fascinating journey spanning the centuries and crossing the borders of the Old Continent, itrsquos an adventure through artistic treasures, going from Botticelli to Van Gogh, going through the main exponents of Scottish art ndash a feature that, Kelvingrove Museum aside, makes of it a unique collection.Though modest in dimensioncompared to other art galleries across Europe, it is dense in quality and rich in ersity. Itrsquos setting in the old building on The Mound makes it a stupendous landmark on Edinburghrsquos skyline. The interior has a feeling of solemnity and cozy familiarity at the same time. Lights and artworks are very well positioned so that the visitor can enjoy the paintings and sculptures at their best. What I found particularly worth of praise is the amount of information given for each piece of the exhibition: whereas many other galleries would not go beyond basic details such as title, author, a few dates and the technique adopted, the National Gallery provides details and background for each masterpiece, making it easier to the occasional visitor to read through the beauty standing in front of them. It unclosed the gallery, making it more accessible and yet entertaining and educational.The staff itself was very warm and from an international background. On the downside, there was little information for those whose native language was not English, though maps were available in the most common European languages and Chinese. I found it a place where I felt welcomed, and where I would go more often to explore in more detail.Vote:  Riverside MuseumPointhouse Place, Glasgow G RSglasgowle.org.uk museums venues riverside-museumSet on the northern bank of the Clyde, the Riverside Museum stands out from the surroundings for its incredible architecture, a legacy from pioneering architect Zaha Hadid, which looks like a mixture between a urban skyline and an ECG segment. Despite being quite a niche genre of display, this transport museum is strong in its interactive approach and its reconstruction of the ages in which the vehicles were in use. This makes locomotives, trams and cars become something more than a mere model ndash they are part of a frame made of sounds, architectures and colours characterising their times, be it the s or the th century. I found staff particularly helpful and attentive, and two simple cafes offer an occasion to rest. What I think is extremely positive is that free tours are available during the day for groups, which is helpful to gain a deeper knowledge of the objects and on the history of the city as well. Part of the information displayed on screens, positioned in ious parts of the building, is available in the most common European languages and Mandarin, although many details appear only in English. It is good to see that there is information in languages which are now part of the Glasgow community, such as Urdu and Polish, to make it more accessible to families living in the area. Overall, this is a very immersive experience: from one of the first carriages of the Glasgow Subway to the Glenlee, the ship moored on the river outside the museum, itrsquos a true moveable feast back in time.Vote: . Kelvingrove Art Gallery and MuseumArgyle St, Glasgow G AGFreeglasgowle.org.uk museums kelvingroveKelvingrove Museumrsquos red walls stand out from the green background of trees of its namesake park, and make it appear even more magnicent and solemn, especially by night, when the lights make it a beautul and a bit sinister sight while it glows through the darkness.I found it a very good starting point to discover the history of this country, especially while going through the paintings and relics of the Scottish Identity in Art section and I appreciated immensely the collection dedicated to local design and Charles Rennie Mackintosh ndash a figure unknown to me before my visit. The free guided tours are very insightful without giving too much information, keeping the visit entertaining and making it easier to take in the concepts passed by the guide. One of the best features is the majestic organ towering over the centre hall: being caught by the resonance of a starting recital while contemplating the ious pieces of the collection or while sipping a coffee in the bar at the ground floor is an utterly pleasant surprise. Moreover, one of the most revered items, namely Christ of St John of the Cross by Salvador Daliacute, is finally back home after a long tour in London and Florida. Set in its own display section, the painting emanates a magnetic aura.Unfortunately, I didnrsquot find any information available in languages other than English, although foreign tourists might benefit from some specic indications. Despite this, Kelvingrove represents a beautul example of a hub dedicated to culture and science.Vote:  OUT OF TOWNLeaving behind the thriving main cities, Scotland is first and foremost known for its sublime outdoors, with landscapes so beautul to often seem unreal. A few of them however seem to attractLoch NessThe legend of the monster is just part of the magnetic attraction that Loch Ness seems to have on the global public. Tourists from all over the world gather ndash a human flow that could easily lead to the transformation of a pure and beautul place in something more similar to a fun park. That has happened, to an extent and tours, cruises and Nessie centres are abundant around Loch Ness shores. Despite this, and in line with an attitude that I particularly appreciate in Scotland, the wilderness and mystic allure of those places have not been altered. The more ldquoboring touristy bits can be avoided by renting a car or going a few steps away the most visited locations ndash the magic is still there.Loch LomondIt is dficult to find a place from which not to adore Loch Lomond, be it walking along its southern shores in Balloch, through the West Highland Way, or crossing the Trossachs National Park by train while heading to the Highlands from Glasgow. I believe people living in Glasgow are extremely lucky to have such an amazing view on their doorstep ndash something that made me fall in love with Scotland. You can drive up from the most industrial centre of the country and you can find yourself lost in nature, with little or no people around you. Its multiple locations make Loch Lomond one of those places to discover bit by bit, getting to know it better each time ndash although it can be tricky to get to places outside the main route without private transport.SkyeThis beautul corner of the world has been in the news due to the influx of tourists which has seen facilities fully booked and ndash at times ndash overwhelmed. On one hand, itrsquos good to see so many people appreciating the breathtaking landscapes of Sligachan, Portree, the Old Man of Storr and many others. On the other hand, the island is probably not equipped as yet to face massive incursions during summer. Something which, I believe, is not entirely a negative side. What Scotland has over other countries is also its ability to preserve its environment, with a respect I wish was present in my home country as well. Although there could be scope for improvement on facilities such as public transport and accommodation, I hope Skye wonrsquot lose its unspoiled beauty."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-insider-guide-st-andrews","story":"As far as visitor attractions go, the home of golf - which also happens to be home to Scotlandrsquos oldest university and some of its most beautul beaches ndash has it all.And although the unique atmosphere of this beautul town in north east Fe never seems to change, the shops and restaurants do move with the times, bringing new le to the cobbled streets.Even when you know St Andrews well, itrsquos a place that constantly draws you back to check out new attractions and reacquaint yourself with old favourites.

Does Glasgow feel like home  To be honest I never thought, as a displaced person, that I would find that kind of calm, warm feeling. But as much as I can have it, I have it here.Glasgow is much calmer than London. It is also the right size of city. We have a saying that Sarajevo is made for a measure of a man. Itrsquos the right size to exist in, and I think Glasgow is the same.During my first month here I couldnrsquot understand anybody. My first night I was in the local shop and this woman started talking to me and I thought what is going on here  Then I realised, lsquoYoursquore the idiot, not the person talking to you.

Self-employed and living in EdinburghThe job that I did in Ghana was examination administrator, a senior job, based in Accra, the capital of Ghana. I came to Scotland because my we had come here to study and had benefited from a scheme which allowed her to stay. It wasnrsquot easy to find work. I could have got work as a teacher in England but that wasnrsquot possible here.People ask questions like, lsquoHow did you come here  Did you come by aeroplane or by boat rsquo Even though we have British nationality, it seems sometimes that people think we are coming in to drain the welfare system. But the job I had in Accra was a very good one.Irsquom a practising Christian and I do volunteer work with the street pastors. I have experienced racism. I had a particularly bad situation where myself and my children were racially abused on the bus. It went to the courts and the guy was found guilty. In spite of all these things itrsquos still better here. For instance, in Africa our healthcare is poor. Also roads are bad. Ghana has one of the highest rates of death by accident in the world. We have people who have come here and made Scotland their home then gone back to visit their family, and never come back because they boarded a car and had an accident and died.Ruzita Millington, grew up in Singapore. Raising her family in EdinburghWhen I was in Singapore, Irsquod never heard of Edinburgh. But, oh my God, Irsquove ended up in a lovely gem of a city. I met my husband in Singapore. He was working there, and he had to come back here with his work. He brought me here on holiday during the festival time. It was love at first sight.The first thing that got me was the culture shock. It was just not what I had imagined. I come from a culture that is quite conservative. I have three children. They know they are Muslims, but they go to Catholic school. They participate in all the Christian events. I think thatrsquos your opportunity to meet other cultures.What I miss most is the food. Recently I made a curry for a girl who had moved from Singapore to study here because I know how it feels to have come here. I cooked her chicken curry for her birthday the way that they have it back home.Lourdes Gala Santos, from Tenere. Lives in Glasgow and works in wind turbine engineeringI moved to Scotland in  because I got a PhD position at the University of Strathclyde. I remember getting on a flight into Prestwick and taking a train into Glasgow and being very excited about my new le. On the train the ticket master was saying, lsquoTickets, tickets.rsquo And he asked, lsquoItrsquos your first time in Scotland rsquo I said, lsquoYeah, Irsquom just moving here. Irsquom so happy to be moving to the north of England.rsquoThe face of this man! He said, lsquoThis is Scotland. Scotland is a country.rsquo So within half an hour of landing I was educated into Scotland being a country. I said I was really sorry. I was so glad that he did not throw me off the train.The following day I kept seeing the St Andrews flag and I phoned my mum and I was saying, they must love Tenere here because our flag is absolutely everywhere. Then I realised that the Scotland flag is exactly the same as the Tenere flag. We share the same flag. It makes me feel at home.My PhD was in aerodynamics and control for wind turbines. So I started a career working in the renewables industry. For wind and tidal and marine renewables, therersquos not a better place to be than Scotland.One of the things that surprised me about people in Scotland is the amount of alcohol people drink with the intent of getting drunk. In Spain and Italy we also drink but not so much to get hammered.Scotland has the most amazing outdoors that Irsquove ever seen. I have travelled quite a bit and when you go to the Highlands or the coast itrsquos incredible. No picture can convey how overwhelming it is up there.

I had rarely touched a bicycle before that..Praveen Kumar, grew up in India, worked in some of the worldrsquos best hotels and runs Tabla restaurant in PerthBefore I came to Scotland I was working for Sandals hotels in Jamaica and met a couple in the Caribbean. I had been going to go to work in the United States but it was them that enlightened me about Scotlandrsquos quality of le. I found a job at the Turnberry. I came in February  and it was a sunny day, but freezing, and I arrived in shorts and a T-shirt from Jamaica. That two minutes walking from my flight to the terminal was my first experience of actually being in the cold.Later, I got headhunted by Gleneagles. Not long after that my parents found a girl for me, in India, and in March  we got married. In  we opened our restaurant, Tabla, in Perth. Somebody recently asked me, lsquoWhy Perth  Yoursquove got so much talent and knowledge. Why not London rsquo The answer was itrsquos not money that motivates me, itrsquos quality of le. My we and I have built a community around us. The restaurant is embedded in the society in which we live.The most important thing Irsquove found here is the people and their friendliness. Theyrsquore approachable. You can approach anyone in Scotland. If you ask me Irsquom Scottish. Itrsquos been  years so I think I can call myself Scottish.I miss the buzz you get in India. Thatrsquos one thing thatrsquos missing here. In Indiayou want to do something, you can do it straight away. If I want to go and see my friends, I just go. I donrsquot need an appointment. I donrsquot need permission. I just go. And, of course, I miss the food, the street food. Thatrsquos what Irsquom building a business around bringing the rustic street food to all over the UK in a chain of restaurants.Tatsuya Minagawa, , from Yamagata, Japan. Owns renowned whisky venue The Highlander Inn in Craigellachie.I was working in a whisky bar in Japan and I thought Irsquod see more of the whisky environment, this is why I came to Scotland. It was meant to be just for one year. Itrsquos been more than  years now. Probably my biggest surprise was how friendly people were. It was strange for a big city like Edinburgh. Itrsquos not the same as in London or Tokyo. Then I moved to Speyside and was a bit worried because it was so remote...but it turned out to be really good.I was let down by the work attitude at first. It was so much dferent than in Japan. The efficiency of the staff, the attention to detailhellip I still think, to be honest, that itrsquos like that. Back home I had to ask only once for something to be done, but here sometimes you have to ask two or three times. But itrsquos a small issue and I love Scotland. I enjoy living here ndash this country welcomed me very well.Working in the whisky industry, I saw that the drinking culture is very dferent. Here, bars close very early, and people rush to get the last drinks, whereas in Japan they are open for longer hours, which means that people take more time to indulge. We do get drunk, too, donrsquot get me wrong, but in a much dferent way.I find that Scottish and Japanese, we are very dferent but also very similar: we donrsquot have big conversations when we meet the first time: it takes a long time to build a relationship, but when it happens, it lasts longer for forever.Vangelis Stamoulis, , came from Athens, Greece, in  to do postgraduate studies at University of Aberdeen. Sales manager in the oil and gas industry.I found the Scottish culture to be very similar to the Greek one: people are very open, sociable and direct and hospitality is great ndash I felt at home almost immediately. One of the surprises was how the weather was, particularly in Aberdeen, being so far in the north. It doesnrsquot change much ndash itrsquos either cold or very cold, you never actually get a summer.What I really like is that you can get in the car and in less than half an hour you are in the middle of an amazing countryside, andyou like hiking, photography, visiting castles or whisky distilleries thatrsquos perfect.I guess that was the most enjoyable aspect: although I live in a city it felt like living in a village. However, Aberdeen is an international city because of the oil and gas industry, you get to meet people from all over the world, and Scottish people are very tolerant with dferent cultures.I think that Brexit is going to affect all of us, both European and British citizens, and will do so in a very bad way.

My -year-old daughter and I came through Heathrow, met my husband and he brought us to Edinburgh. I remember when I walked around then, there were few blacks. But that has changed. Now we have a lot of black people around.

The unions argue that pay has fallen in value over the last decade and they want a % rise as a ldquorestorative measure. Swinney says % is unaffordable and has offered %. A proposed rejig of the main grading scale would also boost incomes.Teachers remain hostile to the offer. A rally in Glasgow, held to promote the pay claim, attracted tens of thousands of supporters. In a consultative ballot last week, around % of members in the two main unions - the EIS and the SSTA - rejected the % offer. A statutory strike vote is getting closer.Swinney could ignore the unions and stick with the % offer, which was formally made by council representatives as part of the tripartite body set up to determine teacher pay. He could argue that no other public sector group is getting close to % and explain that such a rise would go to all teachers, regardless of income, including heads on pound, a year. He could stand his ground.The political reality is he will put more money on the table. Swinney and his Cabinet colleagues are trying to build momentum for a second independence referendum and want to assemble a coalition of voters to tip them over the edge. The SNP Governmentrsquos ultimate objective would not be advanced by tens of thousands of teachers going on strike.Swinney has already antagonised the unions by writing to teachers directly about the % claim. They saw it as an interference in their democratic affairs. It also backfired: after Swinneyrsquos ldquocommunication, teachers overwhelmingly rejected his pay offer. He will now want to dial down the row.What is he likely to do  With extra money coming to Scotland as a result of the UK Government budget, Swinney is in a position to argue for extra resources to bump up the offer. One suggestion is a deal over three years, rather than twelve months. Such an outcome would have the advantage of ensuring that teachers will not cause the Government any more headaches on pay until after the  Holyrood election.Police officers were recently given a multi-year deal and the First Minister last week hinted that a similar offer could be in the pipeline. ldquoPay awards need to be affordable, becausethey are not affordable, they cannot be delivered, she said. ldquoI would love to give teachers and all public sector workers a  per cent pay rise, but that is simply not affordable in a single year.One reason for believing that strike action could be averted is the positive relationship between Swinney and EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan. Whereas EIS members have an increasingly unfavourable opinion of the Education Secretary, the union leader gets on well with Swinney. Asked about him last year, Flanagan said: ldquoI think he is very competent.Back in the s, Flanagan was a Militant Labour councillor in Glasgow whose political career was stymied by the party. He is believed to have a long memory of his treatment by Labour and has constructive relations with the SNP Government. He is also said to be more critical of council umbrella group COSLA than Swinney.However, simply increasing the pay offer creates an additional problem for the Government. Councils employ a range of staff, not just teachers. The unions that represent these workers have made similar arguments about restorative pay claims and they too are limbering up for strike action. If EIS members get %, why should it be lower for those in the GMB, Unite and Unison COSLArsquos position on ldquoparity - which roughly means staff groups receiving the same inflation pay increase - is noteworthy in this respect. Swinney could solve one problem by offering a % rise to teachers, but in the process trigger strike action by the other unions which would want the same for their members. Sturgeon herself raised this point on Thursday by saying that ldquoall public sector workers have suffered because of years of pay restraint.Put another way, consider the range of staff that work in schools as part of the wider ldquoteaching family. If Swinney agreed to a % rise for teachers, heads on pound, would get a pound, boost. By contrast, the lower paid classroom assistants, cleaners and school technicians would get % in one year. It would be a tough sell for any Government that claims to believe in fairness.As Finance Secretary between  and , Swinney had a knack for producing creative solutions to a range of problems involving local government. He will need to be politically nimblehe is to solve the puzzle of the teacher pay dispute.CLASSROOM PAYTeachersPoint pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Headteachers and depute heads can earn between pound, and pound,THE sONE aspect of the current dispute that will be irritating the SNP Government is the repeated comparisons to the Thatcher era, when teachers walked out over pay.Between  and , the EIS led a sustained period of industrial action in protest over pay. John Pollock, the unionrsquos general secretary at the time, said thatthe ldquogrocerrsquos daughter was going to be made to listen, the EIS had to be prepared for a long battle.Action included work to rule and a series of national one day strikes, which included targeting the constituencies of Tory government ministers. Malcolm Rkind, the then Scottish Secretary, responded by announcing an ldquoindependent review into teachersrsquo pay and terms and conditions, after which an agreement was accepted.Over thirty years later, teachers are poised for another strike over pay and opposition politicians are calling for a root and branch review of remunerationWHERE DO THE PARTIES STAND Pay rises for teachers are a matter for the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers, not Holyrood, but opposition parties can apply pressure on the Government.The Scottish Greens have been most vocal in backing the unionsrsquo demands for a % rise and party co-convener Patrick Harvie has brought the issue to the chamber on more than one occasion. Raising the result on the consultative ballot last week, in which nearly % of teachers who took part rejected a % deal, he said:ldquoNone of us needs a maths teacher to help us to understand those numbers. Can the First Minister recall a more overwhelming democratic mandate from any section of the Scottish workforce Labour has also been supportive of the call for a restorative pay award. MSP Iain Gray, a former teacher, was highly critical of the Governmentrsquos decision to write to teachers directly over the % offer. He also compared the SNP Government to previous Tory administrations:ldquoThe last time Scotlandrsquos teachers were angry enough to go on strike Margaret Thatcher was still prime minister, I was a school teacher, the First Minister was a school pupil and some of the % of current teachers who have just rejected the pay offer were not even born.The Conservatives, who have backed pay restraint at a UK Government level, have not supported a % rise. The Liberal Democrats described the ballot result as an ldquoextraordinary and brutal rebuke to Swinney and have called for a ldquofair deal and an independent expert review."},{"url":null,"title":"rossetti-drawing-bought-in-second-hand-bookshop-for-75-to-go-on-show-at-museum","story":"The artwork, called Ricorditi Di Me, Che Son La Pia , has not been exhibited in public in  years.Rossetti featured the model Alexa Wilding, whom he first met in the street, in the  study for a painting he completed in .He used his better-known muse Jane Morris, we of arts and crafts designer William Morris, for the final painting, La Pia DersquoTolomei, which is now in the Spencer Museum of Art in Kansas.The drawing, bought by Sir Ivor Batchelor, is part of the Sir Ivor and Lady Batchelor Bequest, made to the Fitzwilliam in , with highlights of the collection to be displayed from December .Henrietta Ward, assistant keeper for paintings, drawings and prints, said: ldquoThe fact that he found it in the bookshop was quite a fluke.Sir Ivor wrote in an essay: ldquoIt was in the tiny second-hand bookshop of Robert Aitken in Bruntsfield, Edinburgh, in the years immediately after World War Two that I found drawings and prints which were within our miniscule budget and which were often of real quality.ldquoAitken was a dealer of exceptional knowledge and discrimination.ldquoIt was a red letter day in  when off the floor in Aitkenrsquos shop, with a windfall of royalties from a book, we bought for pound Rossettirsquos very fine and very large drawing for La Pia.Museum workers inspecting the piece found a typewritten note from Rossetti on the reverse, with his instructions for care.It read ldquoThis drawing not being lsquosetrsquo it will require the greatest careever removed from its frame, and was followed by Rossettirsquos address.ldquoItrsquos quite nice that he put that little warning note, said Ms Ward.She said Rossetti was ldquoquite famous for his use of models, he had very obsessive relationships with his models.He had an affair with Jane Morris and ldquoabsolutely loved her, Ms Ward said, and had been ldquoobsessed with Wildingrsquos ldquobright auburn hair and her beautul face.The exhibition, called Collecting And Giving: Highlights From The Sir Ivor And Lady Batchelor Bequest, features  objects from the overall collection of  items including drawings, bronzes, glass and pieces of English pottery.Also in the display is a .inbronze statue of Perseus by Sir Alfred Gilbert, who famously sculpted Eros in Piccadilly Circus.Perseus, who killed the snake-haired Medusa in Greek mythology, is portrayed as thoughtful by Gilbert, with one winged sandal off as he equips himself.Sir Ivor Batchelor, who was Professor of Psychiatry at Dundee University from  to , died in  aged .Lady Batchelor died in .The couple first made contact with the Fitzwilliam Museum in  and generously donated objects from their collection over the following decade.This will be the first time items from the Batchelor bequest are exhibited together, and they will be displayed at the Fitzwilliam Museum from December   to March  ."},{"url":null,"title":"university-team-given-celebrity-support-in-scottish-cup-match","story":"Sir Andy Murrayrsquos mother Judy and Olympic swimmer Duncan Scott were among  spectators at the University of Stirlingrsquos fixture against Elgin City on Saturday.It was the first time the team had competed in the third round of the national competition, but they went down - to the Scottish League Two side.Stirling coach Chris Geddes said: ldquoI have been involved with the university for eight seasons now and I have never seen anything like this at a home game before.ldquoI would have loved to have been playing today.

In his BBC interview Raab pointedly refused to endorse Theresa Mays mantra ldquono deal is better than a bad deal. And the Prime Minister is not saying that any more either. If no deal is out and the PMs Withdrawal Agreement is toast, it means Brexit is now seriously stalled.

So what happened  Two events led up to this important juncture: the failed ldquoDads Army coup and the publication of the Political Declaration.The vainglorious attempt by the European Research Group of hard Brexit Tory MPs, led by Jacob Rees Mogg, to organise a coup against the Prime Minister was a dismal failure. They failed to gather enough votes even for a leadership contest to be triggered. It exposed the entire hard Brexit faction of the Conservative Party to ridicule and underlined their own irrelevance. Strike one to Theresa May.Suddenly, the press started to feature more positive images of the PM: no longer the hapless, bumbling dancing queen but a serious politician doing her best, a stateswoman even. One Tory backbench supporter said her opponents were motivated by ldquomisogyny and many women appeared to agree.

In his BBC interview Raab pointedly refused to endorse Theresa Mays mantra ldquono deal is better than a bad deal. And the Prime Minister is not saying that any more either. If no deal is out and the PMs Withdrawal Agreement is toast, it means Brexit is now seriously stalled. This opens the way for the entire process to be halted,an when parliament rejects the May deal emphatically and finally, as it must next month.Yet at the beginning of the week, it rather looked asTheresa May was going to succeed in delivering her Chequers-derived exit deal. So what happened  Two events led up to this important juncture: the failed ldquoDads Army coup and the publication of the Political Declaration.The vainglorious attempt by the European Research Group of hard Brexit Tory MPs, led by Jacob Rees Mogg, to organise a coup against the Prime Minister was a dismal failure. They failed to gather enough votes even for a leadership contest to be triggered. It exposed the entire hard Brexit faction of the Conservative Party to ridicule and underlined their own irrelevance. Strike one to Theresa May.Suddenly, the press started to feature more positive images of the PM: no longer the hapless, bumbling dancing queen but a serious politician doing her best, a stateswoman even. One Tory backbench supporter said her opponents were motivated by ldquomisogyny and many women appeared to agree. A YouGov Times polls showed that the PMs approval rating had risen  points in one week.But then came what was probably the crunch moment in the entire two and a half years of Brexit negotiations: the publication of the  page Political Declaration.

Israel responded to the rockets with air strikes at more than  sites in Gaza. The violence was the worst in the region since the -day conflict in .In August  then Minister for External Affairs Humza Yousaf condemned rocket attacks from Gaza but added that Israelrsquos response was ldquodisproportionate.His assessment was based on the death toll in Gaza, where , people died, including , civilians. On the Israeli side,  soldiers and six civilians died.Michael Oren MKsaid: ldquoI understand the Scottish Government has taken a position on us which is probably the harshest of any political party in Europe. They vie with some of the Swedish parties and the Irish parties.ldquoBut let me say aboutdisproportionality. First of all, it is a gross misreading of international law. I studied international law. Disproportionality says very simply that an army can only use the force necessary to meet the threat. If we use a certain amount of force and rockets continue to fall on our territory then the force cannot be disproportionate, just cannot by definition.ldquoSo, itrsquos a gross misreading and I would say a gratuitous misreading of disproportionality principles. We are in fact,anything, under proportion in our use of force.ldquoMany other societies, most other societies, would use a reckless amount of force to stop rockets falling on civilians. We have not done that. We have the power, boy we have the power. We could end it very quickly.Human Rights organisation Amnesty issued a report on Israel earlier this year which accused the government of ldquocollectively punishing Gazarsquos entire population with an air, land and sea blockade.The blockade has triggered a humanitarian crisis with electricity cuts affecting clean water and sanitation and diminishing health service access. The blockade has rendered Gaza increasingly ldquounliveable, according to the United Nations.Oren said: ldquoI know this is dficult but when you think about Gaza you have to throw out everything you know about everything in human affairs. Irsquoll give you examples. Hamaswants to keep a low light on the humanitarian crisis there but it burnt down a crossing to Gaza three times. It burnt fuel lines to a population which is in any case only getting three hours a day of electricity.ldquoAnd by the way Hamas has   electricity in its tunnels and its bunkers and headquarters. No problems there with electricity, no problems with water.The Scottish Government said its position on the situation in Gaza ldquowas and continues to be in line with much mainstream international opinion.A spokesman for the Scottish Government added: ldquoMore generally, we support international efforts to bring resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on working towards a two-state solution."},{"url":null,"title":"top-israeli-politician-celtic-fans-who-fly-palestinian-flag-are-sad","story":"Michael Oren, deputy minister in the Israeli Prime Ministerrsquos office, also said collecting cash at matches for charities thathelp Palestinians is ldquoill-advised.But when asked what he thought about Rangers fans who fly the Israeli flag the politician smiled and said: ldquoI like lsquoem.The Herald revealed in September that the Palestinian and Israeli flags were on a police list of flags which could be a criminal offence to fly in Scotland.A ldquorestricted document issued to officers includes pictures of potentially criminal symbols and a brief description of the laws which may be brokenthey are flown ldquoin a provocative manner.The Israeli flag is flown by loyalists who ldquoalign themselves with Israel due to British support for the state, according to the document.

Perhaps theyrsquoll be watching tomorrow when InSight touches down on that distant world which has so long held sway over the imagination of humanity. Perhaps theyrsquoll realise that the landerrsquos mission is another vital rung placed in the ladder which will inevitably take us sooner rather than later from this blue planet to that red planet.Nasarsquos Insight lander is basically a robot geologist which will unlock the secrets of Mars - including why the planet has no electro-magnetic field to protect it from the sunrsquos deadly radiation. If Mars ever bore le then one theory has it that it was the loss of its magnetic shield which caused that le to end. Andmicroscopic le is still there, it will be hidden beneath the surface away from those killer rays.InSight left Earth in May and is set to make touch down around noon on Monday. The excitement in the space community around Insight is tangible - everyone you speak to can barely contain their anticipation, because InSight underscores that what was once thought impossible is now becoming probable: humankind will one day walk on the surface of our closest planetary neighbour, and most likely colonise it too.However, while that journey now looks very likely to take place in the near future - perhaps as early as the mid-s - the struggle to make it happen is Herculean. Lives will be lost, trillions spent, reputations made, and careers ruined. But when that manned mission happens, it will change humankind forever. Not only will we have become a space-faring species, and secured ourselves from extinction - with humans on two planets it is unlikely we will ever be wiped out by war, weather or any other wild event - but humanity will have created a collective and unying goal that will change how we co-operate across nations and see ourselves and neighbours. It would be the greatest moment of change in the history of humankind - and it will probably happen in our letime. On top of all that, we could also discover whether there was ever - or perhaps even still is - le on Mars, albeit microbial, and answer the most profound of all questions: lsquoAre we alone rsquoSome ask whether the pay-off is worth the risk. Most scientists tend to think like Jim Lovell, the astronaut who commanded Apollo  on its near fatal mission to the Moon in . lsquoIs it worth it rsquo Lovell asks himself in his mid-west drawl. lsquoUh-huh, itrsquos worth it.rsquoChapter OneFIRST STEPSRight now, in labs and research centres around the world the groundwork is being laid for the future mission. Biologists and chemists are working out how astronauts will take enough water and food to stay alive on a  million mile journey lasting around seven months. Psychologists are trying to establish how a handful of people will endure such a voyage in a gloried tin can and then live together without killing each other while pioneering the harshest environment humanity has ever experienced. Physicists and engineers are designing the sort of rockets and le support systems that will get us there - and hopefully back.Liz Seward, senior strategist at Airbus Defence and Space - which is building the new Mars rover for the European Space Agency at Stevenage in England - says the next decade will be spent learning how humans can live in space. The moon will be used as a testing ground and sometime after  people could be exploring the red planet. lsquoTherersquos water ice there so humans would be able to live there and mine it,rsquo Seward says.Seward thinks that the future of space exploration depends on private companies working with national governments. lsquoGoing into space is quite expensive,rsquo she says, adding: lsquoEventually someone has to pay for it and there has to be a reason to be out there. There are resources you can find on Mars and the Moon and on asteroids that you canrsquot find on Earth.rsquoChapter TwoGETTING THEREElon Musk - one of the richest people in the world and a man who could have stepped from the pages of a sci-fi novel himself - has as his chief project the building of cities on Mars. His company SpaceX has supercharged the new space race.Muskrsquos engineers are designing the Big Falcon Rocket- a fully reusable spacecraft. His team is evangelical - weeping when rockets crash land and ecstatic when a flight goes well.But humanity is still a long way from the goal. lsquoAll we can do right now,rsquo says Jim Green, Nasarsquos planetary science ision director, lsquois land a one tonne rover, to get humans there we need a  tonne spaceship.rsquoThe key is next-generation retro-rockets. The Martian atmosphere is so thin that there is little to slow a spacecraft coming in at Mach . Any ship will need to turn its thrusters to the surface of the planet and fire them up to cause enough drag to land safely. Bladed shields will be indispensable to stop the craft evaporating in the heat of its descent, and even old-fashioned parachutes will be required to add a little extra gravitational pull.Chapter ThreeTHE COLONYSo what do we do once we get there  Most probably the first humans to arrive on Mars will live in their ship - but that couldnrsquot last long due to the effects of solar radiation. Eventually, wersquod have to build some permanent site. This Martian outpost wonrsquot be a series of domes in the arid landscape. Wersquore more likely to set up home in the empty lava tubes of extinct volcanoes - where there might be a chance to find frozen water and where wersquod definitely be much safer from solar rays.A Martian colony would comprise a number of key buildings: therersquod be lsquohabsrsquo for living in a communications and satellite post a medical centre a cargo centre an oxygen creation centre called a lsquoMoxiersquo a water creation centre called a lsquoWarsquo a solar  field a D printer post a nuclear reactor and a mining centre. It would be austere but efficient.Chapter FourTHE FIGHT FOR SURVIVALBut would it be survivable  Astronaut, Scott Kelly, spent a year on the International Space Station, while his twin brother Mark, a former Space Shuttle commander, stayed on Earth, in order to test the long term effects of space travel on the human body. Muscles atrophy, bones weaken, the cardio-vascular system slows, red blood cell production drops, balance deteriorates, eyesight fails, the immune system is hampered. Thatrsquos just the really bad stuff - therersquos also a constant blocked up nose, insomnia, and the dreaded space farts because interplanetary travel means extra gas in the body, not a lot of fun when yoursquore trapped in a command module.So much for the physical effects - what about the mind  Two main projects have tested psychological resilience to space travel: the Hi Seas Mission at Mauna Loa on Hawaii and the Mars  Mission in Russia. In both cases, small crews were kept isolated in a simulated spacecraft for months on end. As all Mars scientists know, the human being must be as resilient as the rocket.From the Mars  experiment, only two crew remained psychologically heathy out of six. Four experienced problems with mood, impulsivity and insomnia. Most were trained astronauts and medics. We still donrsquot know why there were effected, or how to prevent such effects reoccurring.Chapter FiveTHE SWEET SPOTSo once we make the gruelling journey where would we land  Dr Philip Thomas, principal investigator with ExoMars, the joint European-Russian mission hunting for le on the red planet, says until the ExoMars satellite swung over our distant neighbour in  we knew lsquodiddly-squatrsquo. Wersquod only mapped about three percent of Mars. lsquoMoving dunes, dust devils, polar caps, are all now being seen,rsquo he says.Once we have a D map of the planet wersquoll be able to pick the safest, flattest site. Mars is known as the graveyard after all. Nasa historian Roger Launius of the Smithsonian Institute explains that only % of probes sent to Mars are successful in their mission. lsquoThatrsquos not a great track record,rsquo he says.Launias thinks our initial forays to Mars will be a little like our journeys to Antartica. Initially wersquoll explore, then wersquoll build a research station at a sweet spot that is resupplied with people and material from the outside world, and slowly wersquoll build up a presence in an inhospitable land. McMurdo Station in Antartica is now an effective city with many nations working together there.Chapter SixDAILY LIFE ON THE RED PLANETHowever, as the popular scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson makes clear: lsquoIf you want to stay there, you need to grow your own food.rsquo At first, wersquoll do this is small greenhouses, then giant greenhouses, but in the long-term the plan would be to terraform Mars - to turn the red planet green. Broadly speaking, that means creating a huge greenhouse gas effect to heat the planet and thicken the atmosphere, but as yet we donrsquot have the technology, so when we do get there it looks like wersquoll be living in habs at the bottom of volcanoes and eating greenhouse GM food for a while.Just because we get there, though, it doesnrsquot mean wersquoll survive. The docu-drama Mars, on the National Geographic channel, paints a terrying portrait of le for early settlers - all informed by scientists like deGrasse Tyson. Mars is unforgiving. It kills. Rockets mal, fires break out, minds snap - and a trail of human bodies is left littering the path to humanityrsquos new frontier.Perhaps the greatest risk to human le once we get there is weather. Nasarsquos Jim Green says: lsquoWersquove been studying dust storms for quite some time and therersquos a particular season where some of the dust storms can go global. They can be enormous -  kilometres high. They can get charged and in the case of these really large storms lightning can strike.rsquo These storms can last a month. It sounds impossible to survive.Chapter SevenWHERE THERErsquoS A WILLhellipRichard Nixon was the president who pulled back from the drive to go to Mars, following public concern in the wake of Jim Lovellrsquos Apollo  expedition, and focussed instead on Space Shuttle missions. Many in the space community call the shuttle project lsquogoing into low orbitrsquo as it didnrsquot really take humankind anywhere. It was like giving up on the New World after Columbus sailed to America.With that in mind, loss of le - which many see as inevitable - could derail any Martian exploration. Roger Launius, from the Smithsonian, says: lsquoIf you send astronauts to Mars and they die there, I guarantee you that public opinion will prohibit you from ever doing it again.rsquo Itrsquos little wonder that the moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, are named after the gods of fear and terror.The thing is, though, humanity has already dreamt of going to Mars. From the ancients through to modern science fiction writers, we have the idea of journeying to, and living on, Mars engrained in our collective consciousness. If yoursquove dreamt something, yoursquoll most likely one day do it.Peter Diamandis, co-founder of Planetary Resources - an asteroid mining company - says: lsquoTherersquos a romanticism about going to Mars and colonising it - and itrsquos a future in which we are building cities. We humans love a target. We love to have something to shoot for, to aim for hellip itrsquos been the case over and over again, whether itrsquos the colonisation of the New World, the railroads, the opening up of the west, all these things are impossible until we make them real.rsquoTHE SCOTS SCIENTIST HELPING PIONEER MARSDR PATRICK Harkness is a modestly-spoken man. Most of us wouldnrsquot be quite as humble about our endeavours as he is - after all, the Glasgow University scientist has developed a key piece of kit without which human exploration of Mars just wouldnrsquot be feasible.On Mars, low gravity makes it almost impossible to drill - the lack of weight means itrsquos extremely hard to get the necessary heft behind drilling machinery to crack the surface. But Harknessrsquos ultrasonic drill removes that problem - and think how important drilling will be on the red planet. As we know, itrsquos more likely we will live underground. Wersquoll also be searching for water beneath the surface, and microbial signs of le - whether long-dead or still alive and kicking - will probably be underground away from killer solar rays.For Harkness, though, there are big ethical questions over what we do with samples found on Mars. The plan for a Mars lsquosample and rsquo mission is already well underway. Its first stage would see a robot mission bring back rocks and possibly even evidence of extinct or extant microbial le. The work done in Glasgow has advanced the science around lsquosample and rsquo, but Harkness worries about the possible risk of Martian rocks contaminating Earth.lsquoWhen you take samples from another planet and bring them to Earth, you have to be absolutely certain they pose no threat,rsquo he says, lsquoand as unlikely as it may appear that there will be any virus or protein in these Martian samples, chances can not be taken.rsquoHarkness speculates the safest plan might be to take the samples no further than the International Space Station and analyse them there. Perhaps, they could be rendered inert on the ISS and then transferred to Earth.Hersquos conscious of the fact that with private companies now potentially leapfrogging governments in the space race that business needs to be regulated in the same way as agencies like Nasa for safetyrsquos sake. lsquoYou need regulation to stop crazy people putting the planet at risk,rsquo Harkness says from his office in the School of Engineering. lsquoTherersquos nothing wrong with doing things privately as long as they are regulated. If people just went to Mars and brought back samples that would be dangerous.rsquoAnother ethical worry for Harkness is the inevitable result of colonisation: babies. lsquoSay someone got pregnant on Mars - then you have a child who didnrsquot chose to be born on another planet. They will grow up experiencing one third of the gravity of Earth so their muscle tone will not be the same, their heart will not be strong enough to pump blood to their brainthey ever ed to Earth.rsquoDespite his caution, hersquos pretty confident that there will be men and women walking on Mars within his letime - and hersquos only . Such a monumental achievement, he said, could well uny our increasingly fractured planet and make Earth a better place for all."},{"url":null,"title":"future-shock-the-secrets-of-spiritualists-and-why-its-unlikely-any-of-them-are-going-to-heaven-themselves","story":"Yoursquoll note he didnrsquot mention women, but maybe itrsquos because therersquos simply no requirement for a defined gender ldquoup there.

Doubt the broo fork out for that one.Even something as innocuous and silly as psychic mailings ndash letters promising spiritual messages ndash is estimated to cost UK believers poundm each year, according to Office of Fair Trading research.Yet, itrsquos newer technological devilry such as online and satellite TV services that have allowed spiritualism to join the dark pantheon of digital cam-sex, casinos and bingo in casting a spell of mass zombied stupor over the nation.Right now, millions are sacricing their dignity in supermarket aisles, scrapping with strangers over yellow Whoops! sticker food items ndash just so they have enough cash to send on a one-way journey to humming servers registered for tax reasons in the Isle of Man ndash chasing the dragon of thrills and comfort clearly missing in their real lives.Tricks of the tradeThe well known terms lsquocold readingrsquo and lsquohot readingrsquo are little more than clever use of what is known to sociologists as the Forer Effectand itrsquos how even the smartest of us can be taken in by those who \"talk to the dead\" and accept all major credit cards - but would likely prefer cash in hand.The bold, brave Derren Brown has masterfully built an admirable career using similar psychological tricky, suggestion and subtle thought manipulaton but at least he and others such as entertainer Keith Barry - who made one of the most successful TedTalks of all time when he guessed the name of a womans ex with just a few quesions - never actually claim to be psychic. Quite the opposite - mentalists like Brown and Barry seem to get a kick out of exposing the woo and deception of ldquoreal mystics who monetise on human weakness and susceptibility. Its the oldest game in town.So why are so many otherwise clever folk fooled  There are countless methods, some learned, some a natural sensitivity to expressions and vocal tics, but herersquos a few familiar and perhaps not so familiar.Firstly, the fact we are social animals who assimilate to our environment and mostly play along with the overarching vibe is one always exploited by mediums. Itrsquos quite clear to psychics that you are not seeing them reluctantly like the docs or dentist - you are there for one very specic reason - and have paid money to get it. Therefore, you want value and will fool even yourself to feel you got it.Secondly, a familiar ldquovagueness of the connection to the spiritual ether allows psychics to backtrack on their many mistakes, using them as ldquofeelers. While they explain to you that the spirit world doesnt always communicate clearly, mibbie still on dial-up, theyrsquore studying each of your facersquos  muscles for the slightest twitch at their vague suggestions of common first names, initials, common cancers and medical conditions, funeral songs, coloured house doors and dog collar material. Its all very mundane in the afterle, it seems.One does wonder why spirits play games with initials. And instead of telling us that you liked the cardigan we wore at the graveyard, tell us what God is like. What has your new plane of existence revealed about the meaning of it all, granny  Oh, you liked the song we chose at the funeral - thanks for coming through from the great beyond to share that. pound well spent, but no receipt.The whistleblowerWe all like to think ourselves as unreadable behind our social masks, but the true is wersquore all pretty much open books to those who know what theyrsquore looking for - especially now in the days of ubiquitous social media. Simple, minute shts in body language, facial expression and plenty of other subtle cues also leave us standing as naked as Cheggars on Channel .One rather simple yet effective trick was part of a confession by psychic-turned-whistleblower Mark Edward, who revealed when customers paid in advance by credit card for the psychic session, the crook on the other side - of the phone, that is - will not only receive the money but be able to see an itemised credit card history. You can certainly tell a lot about people by what they buy over the course of a month. Where they shop, how much they spend, what particular items - its all builds up a very vivid picture.Fortunately for us, whilst the scam is common practice and perfectly legitimate in the US, using credit card details in this way is illegal in the UK. ldquoItrsquos not a gt, says Edward. ldquoItrsquos maybe a skill - but I call it fraud. I have met people who are very intuitive and sensitive but there is nothing supernatural about them. They just assess information that most people donrsquot think about.\"Psychic BrexitersIN a world where a TV advert highlighting the environmental folly of palm oil production is banned, you may wonder how mediums get the green light to advertise that they can contact the dead and predict the future.Well, since , they actually canrsquot ndash and itrsquos how the spiritualist community found unlikely solidarity in another set of confidence trickers ndash the Brexiters.Unamused by folk profiting from the misery and vulnerability of others, the EU brought in new Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations forcing all commercial traders to substantiate claims made about their business ndash not easy for psychics with the whole chatting to the dead thing. They clearly never saw it coming. Humiliated spiritualists have since been forced to describe their once-revered services as ldquofor entertainment purposes only or ldquoan experiment.Perhaps they should be happy theyrsquoll never need to prove their creative fabrications are valid banter from the spirit world. It also seems the EU made a sound prediction itself ndash that in Brexit Britain, more ldquoentertainment will be absolutely necessary to stop us eating each other. And are you not entertained And finally ...MY dad was once interrupted by the police while burying our dog Trudy in the grounds of a local church. ldquoWhat the f*** you playing at, mate  they apparently enquired.I donrsquot know what my dad was playing at either. He had little faith in anything beyond his next ciggie, making Richard Dawkins look like Billy Graham. Yet, he loved that dog ndash and like most of us in our agnostic clouds of fuzzy logic, my dad perhaps thought ldquowell, just in case.So did old Trudyrsquos immortal soul ascend to Heaven  Well, despite never biting anyone, giving a paw for treats and always eating her dinner, no.Yet, one Scottish medium, ldquopsychic barber Gordon Smith ndash the UKrsquos ldquomost accurate, apparently ndash claims my dadrsquos near-arrest was not in vain.He believes Trudy has simply entered another room in the great cosmic house of trans-dimensional planes. Not only that, Gordon claims that he could perhaps even make contact with her. ldquoBecause Irsquom used to having animals around me it feels natural when a deceased pet comes into contact, he is quoted as saying.Gordon recently sold out his rather wittily-named ldquoBest of Both Worlds show at Glasgowrsquos Pavilion. ldquoFor entertainment purposes, stated the poster ndash which, admirably, also makes an effort to clary to his predominantly elderly, perhaps Brexit-inclined audience, that it was the EU to blame for his demotion to mere ldquoentertainer.It might not be such a dogs le for spiritualists in Brexit Britian, however."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-what-comes-next-for-the-prime-minister-and-her-deal-with-the-eu","story":"After clearing a major hurdle, here is what lies ahead for the deal, the Prime Minister and Britainrsquos exit from the EU.Many thought it would be near-impossible for Mrs May to secure consensus among all of the EUrsquos leaders back when Article  was triggered on March  . Furthermore, few predicted that one of the biggest threats to the deal would eventually come from Brexiteer MPs when, in the early stages of the negotiations, Remain campaigners took the Government to the highest court in the land in order to secure a meaningful vote for MPs. This Commons vote is the major hurdle Mrs May must now overcomeher hard-won deal is to be enshrined in UK law. The vote is expected to take place before MPs break for Christmas in December.Led by figures including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, a swathe of Brexiteer Tories have rejected Mrs Mayrsquos deal and called for it to be renegotiated. This raises the prospect of some of Mrs Mayrsquos own MPs voting against the agreement when it goes before the Commons. Appearing at the DUP conference on Saturday, Mr Johnson said the deal will leave the UK a ldquosatellite state of the EU. In the Sunday Express Mr Rees-Mogg said the deal ldquodoes not deliver on Brexit and ldquoinstead of taking back control, in some areas it will leave the United Kingdom with even less control than it currently has: the vassal state.LIVE: Watch Rt Hon Arlene Foster MLA ndash Party Leaderrsquos Address at the #DUP Party Conference in Belfast gt https:whellip https:t.co yhGYiTENmdash DUPNovember , The Euroscepticsrsquo rejection of the plans stems in large part from the dealrsquos backstop provision for the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

The DUP say the backstop would see Northern Ireland adopt a dferent regulatory regime to Great Britaina wider UK EU trade deal fails to materialise. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the draft deal fails to protect the Union. With  MPs in the Commons, their support could be crucial for Mrs Mayrsquos deal to pass.Labour repeatedly warned that they would vote against any deal that does not pass six tests. Among the requirements are that it delivers the ldquoexact same benefits, fair management of migration and the protection of workersrsquo rights and protections.

A final public exhibition will be held on Thursdayat Kinellar Community Hall in Blackburn. Each exhibition will run from  noon to pm.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson said: “The Scottish Government has given a clear commitment to dual the A which will see delivery of around  miles of upgraded road between Inverness and Aberdeen, a huge task but one we are committed to delivering.“As part of that work, we are taking forward the design work for the  mile stretch of the route between east of Huntly and Aberdeen and now we are able to let people see the initial options we have developed for this challenging section of the A.“A number of options have been deselected at this stage as a result of existing topography, engineering complexity and environmental impact. This includes those near Bennachie and those through Inverurie on the existing A.”The removal of the plan to upgrade the A through the Bennachie Special Landscape Area has been welcomed by Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin.Last month, Ms Martin welcomed campaigners from the Save Bennachie group to meet with new Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to discuss their concerns.The group also previously met with then Economy Minister Keith Brown earlier this year to discuss their opposition to the plans.Ms Martin MSP said: “I am thrilled Transport Secretary Michael Matheson has confirmed the route passing Bennachie has now been dropped.“The Save Bennachie group have tirelessly campaigned and shown true passion and dedication for their cause.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Macdonald Pittodrie House has been shortlisted for the Wedding of the Year category\"  North east hotel makes award finals viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“I commend them all for a campaign which has been time-consuming and, those who were a part of it, for their commitment and determination.“They managed to achieve cross-party support and I know MSPs from all parties shared a collective admiration for them.“I would like to thank the Transport Minister and Transport Scotland for all their work to date and for taking the time to meet with myself, other MSPs and the Save Bennachie team to listen to their views.

Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Sunday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amAdvertorial: Date: th November  Time: .pm – .pm Venue: Kirkwall  St Ola Community Centre, Broad Street, Kirkwall, Orkney Islands KW DH sectors.sepa.org.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Sunday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The daughter of a self-made man, Coates gained a first in econometrics and went on to build her business up from scratch as a result of an instinct for the future and sheer hard graft. As that business grew, she based it in Stoke – bringing good jobs to a languishing post-industrial city – and set up a foundation which has donated £m to charities like Oxfam and CAFOD. On top of throwing energy into growing her company, she has five children, four of whom are adopted from the same family.There is a lot to commend there in , her entrepreneurship was recognised when she was awarded a CBE for her services to the community and business and the following year she was named one of the UK’s most powerful women by BBC Radio ’s Woman’s Hour.And yet for all Coates’ undoubted attributes, there is no getting away from the central fact: her online betting company, Bet, which last year had an operating profit of £m, has flourished on the back of the UK’s two million problem gamblers and the obscene salary she pays herself – which is , times the national average – is money that would have been better staying in the pockets of those iniduals who can ill afford to lose on the horses .Much attention has been paid to the evils of Fixed Odds Betting Terminalswhich have been spreading like smallpox in the UK’s most deprived areas where people stake what little money they haveon the vain hope of beating the system.FOBTs – described as the “crack cocaine of gambling” – are so pernicious because bets of up to £ can be placed every  seconds often the terminals are juxtaposed with pawnshops encouraging those who have already lost too much to trade their possessions for one more go.After a succession of suicides were linked to FOBTs, the government promised to reduce the maximum stake to £. Of course, reducing the maximum stake reduces profits, which in turn reduces income to the Treasury. It took the resignation of sports minister Tracey Crouch to force the government to back down on plans to delay the move until October . Thanks to Crouch, it will now take place in April as originally promised.This is a step forward but the understandable focus on FOBTs means the burgeoning issue of online gambling has been less publicised. Which brings us back to Coates. Coates is no stranger to high stakes. She began her career in her family’s bookmakers business. In , she realised the future of gambling was online and borrowed £m from RBS with the family firm as collateral. Her risk paid off as Bet has grown into one of the world’s largest online gambling companies, taking £.bn in wagers last year alone.But there are many things about Betthat don’t sit easy. There’s its name for a start. Bet is encouraging consistent, daily betting – not the odd flutter on the World Cup or the Grand National.Then there’s the whole tax avoidance thing. Like most online gambling companies Bet moved its headquarters to Gibraltar because of its more “favourable regulations” .But mostly, the unease with Coates’ success comes from knowing it is built onan upsurge in online gambling amongst smart phone-using millennials who can place a bet at the tap of a screen. Unlike casinos and indeed FOBTs, online gambling sites can be accessed day or night, sober or drunk, and using a credit card. The service Coates’ company offers is not merely  days a year, but also  .A recent report from the Gambling Commission showed  to -year-olds are the group most likely to have more than five online gaming accounts and to have gambled in the past four months.Online, stakes on casino games like blackjack and roulette have been known to be as high as £,. In sports, there is now a panoply of hypotheticals you can take a punt on. Where once the options were fairly limited – the final result, the highest goal scorer – there is much more focus on in-play betting: the first penalty, the first red card or even, in one famous case, whether or not a particular player will eat a pie on camera. Sure, some of this is harmless – a way of adding a bit of extra excitement to the event but it’s not the harmless gambling that brings the likes of Bet the millions it’s the problem gambling. Coates’ financial success also underlines the way in which gambling and football have become totally enmeshed. North and south of the border, betting companies such as William Hill and Ladbrokes sponsor leagues and cups and strips, largely replacing tobacco and alcohol brands.In Coates’ case, the connection is even closer Bet has . per cent of the shares in Stoke City FC Coates’ father Peter is the chairman and her husband Robert is a director.Online gambling is widespread among players who tend to have a lot of down time sitting around hotel rooms with nothing to do but play on their phones there is peer pressure too. It gives the players something to bond over, the irony being, of course, thatthey are caught gambling on football matches they face a fine or suspension.I suppose you could argue that making money out of gambling is no worse than making it out of smoking or drinking all three involve fostering potential addictions. But in Coates’ case, it’s the sheer scale of the inidual profiteering that shocks. The £m she is pocketing this year alone is more than double the total wage bill for Stoke City.That sum would be offensive enough in any sphere butshe were making her money from manufacturing a product or providing a service or creating something of social value, then at least there would be a quid pro quo.As it is, it is dirty, predatory money, and she’s made no attempt to cleanse it the addiction charity Addaction claims the sum she paid herself is over  times more than the entire industry’s contribution to treatment, and her foundation has made no contribution to that cause.To say Coates has worked hard for what she has earned is not enough to say she is not breaching any laws is a cop-out.The growth of Bet depends on persuading more and more people to squander money they cannot afford on a game that, in the long-run, they will always lose. And – successful woman in a man’s world though she is – that’s not something to celebrate.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834733.1543145149!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon there s almost nothing true in theresa may s brexit letter","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has hit out at Theresa May#s public plea for Brexit support, saying #almost nothing in this desperate letter is true#.In a “letter to the nation” published before the Prime Minister met the other  EU leaders in Brussels, Mrs May said leaving the union on March   would mark “a new chapter in our national le”.The -word message said that the result of the EU referendum in  would be honoured and that freedom of movement would end.It also stated that the UK would “take back control” of laws and money which,it suggested, could be spent on the NHS.Scotland’s First Minister described the letter as “desperate” and reiterated her calls for alternatives such as staying in the single market and customs union or holding a second referendum.Ms Sturgeon tweeted: “I don’t say this lightly, but almost nothing in this desperate letter is true.“This is a bad deal, driven by the PM’s self defeating red lines and continual pandering to the right of her own party. Parliament should reject it and back a better alternative - SM CU or #PeoplesVote.”As EU leaders endorsed the deal on Sunday, SNP MSP Brexit secretary Mike Russell said it “does not work for Scotland”.“It takes Scotland out of the European Union against our democratic wishes, it removes us from the single market against our economic interests, and it would put us at a competitive economic disadvantage compared to Northern Ireland,” he said.“The only thing it guarantees is years of damaging uncertainty, which will cost jobs and hit living standards and, by ending freedom of movement, will make it harder to attract the staff we need for our NHS“That is why the Scottish Government will now work with others to get a better deal for Scotland within the European single market and customs union - which is eight times bigger than the UK market alone - and why we support another referendum on EU membership.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834693.1543131384!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish independence campaigners aim to thrive on brexit turmoil","story":"Independence campaigners are mobilising as they seek to #seize the opportunity# presented by the Brexit turmoil engulfing UK politics, leading figures among pro-nationalist groups have said.They say Nicola Sturgeon will “absolutely get a mandate” to stage a second referendumshe puts it to the people at the next Holyrood election, as Westminster continues to withold authority.But the First Minister has been warned she must adopt a radical approach to persuade Scots that a Yes vote will avert the looming “clf edge” of Brexit and transform the country’s fortunes.It has prompted claims from pro-Union groups that nationalists will “never stop” campaigning for independence despite no sht in the polls towards a majority for independence.Sturgeon has come under fresh pressure to set out her timetable for a second referendum after publication of the final EU Withdrawal Deal was met with derision and appears likely to be rejected in the Commons. “Across the board in the Yes movement there is a real appetite to seize this moment of opportunity,” said Green MSP Ross Greer, who was also communities co-ordinator with the official Yes Scotland group during the last campaign.“A UK state that is in complete crisis, that is bogged down in its own contradictions, is causing this damage to Scotland and the UK as a whole in such a visible public way.”He said “huge numbers”ofpeople were getting involved in such things as marches outwith the formal party political campaigns.“The opportunity we have to really give the independence vision a shot in the arm is to give a vision of how things can be better – or how do we mitigate the damage of this bad decision, but present a vision for society that says this doesn’t have to be Scotland’s long-term future.”The Scottish Independence Convention, an umbrella body of  pro-independence groups recently announced plans to take on two full-time employees as part of a drive get support for a Yes vote above  per cent.

That’s why we’re setting up the company and employing staff and getting ourselves organised. We need to be ready for whenever that campaign happens. At the moment, it’s very dficult to know when that’s going to be.“We’re ready any time. We could go very quickly, butit’s a bit further down the line. we’re ready for that as well.”Margaret Young, national co-ordinator with Women for Independence, said local groups had been forming in recent months even without any particular promotional activity.“Throughout  we’ve had about one new group a month forming,” she added.The roadblock facing the SNP at Holyrood as it seeks to hold another vote is the fact that Westminster has control over the constitution and Theresa May has refused to grant the “section ” order which would pave the way for a second vote. The First Minister has ruled out a Catalonia-style vote without legal backing and indicated last week that she may put the referendum to the people by making it the centrepiece of the Holyrood election in . If a pro-independence majority was ed, such as the current SNP-Greens alliance at Holyrood, it would be seen as an irrefutable mandate.Greer added: “In those circumstances I think you absolutely can get a mandate to win another referendum and in that situation any continued opposition from the UK government would just be completely unsustainable.”The last independence campaign initiallyfloundered, Greer said, when it sought to allay voters fears’ of leaving the UK with the message change would “safe” and minimal.“The public know independence is a massively radical step,” he added.“We need to justy why that radical step is necessary and will result in better things. We need a compelling message from the start.”But pro-Union campaigners insist there is no appetite for independence among most Scots as the post-Brexit chaos ensues.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “This is a stark reminder that nationalist groups will never stop campaigning for a isive and unnecessary second independence referendum.“We know from polls that the majority of people in Scotland want to remain in the UK.“But there must be absolutely no complacency. The SNP and its allies are weaponising Brexit in the hope of boosting support for leaving the UK.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834681.1543093510!/image/image.jpg","title":"scots mps drawn to norway plan as brexit alternative","story":"Scottish MPs have held talks about a Brexit fallback plan that would see the UK stay in the single market and customs union, while escaping from the EU#s Common Fisheries Policy.The plan’s author, Conservative MP Nick Boles, said his proposal would solve the Brexit dilemmas face by Scottish Tories, and had also attracted interest from the SNP.During a day of meetings at Westminster to try to find common ground with opposition parties, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would consider the Boles plan for a “Norway plus” exit from the EU, and acknowledged that any alternative to Theresa May’s deal with Brussels would need support from Tory MPs to pass the Commons.Boles, the MP for Grantham and Stamford in Lincolnshire and a former skills minister under David Cameron, says he supports the Prime Minister’s draft deal. However, with around  of his Conservative colleagues publicly opposing it, the deal is unlikely to pass.“From my point of view, all we’re trying to do here is deliver Brexit in a way that doesn’t do damage to the Union and doesn’t do damage to our own economy, and I think EEA Efta is the best possible way of doing that,” Boles told Scotland on Sunday.“I think it’s potentially a very good plan for the Scottish people, and all parties that represent them,” he added. Under Norway plus, which EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has previously said is on offer from Brussels, the UK would remain in the European Economic Areavia membership of the European Free Trade Association , which includes single market members Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.Efta members are not members of the EU customs union, but the UK would strike a customs deal separately with Brussels to keep the free flow of goods.Because the whole of the UK would remain within the single market, as well as EU customs rules there would be no need for the Irish border backstop, and no risk of a trade barrier in the Irish Sea or competitive advantage for Northern Ireland compared with Scotland.And because accession to Efta is expected to take much less time than negotiating a new security and trade agreement between the UK and EU, there would be no risk of needing to extend the -month post-Brexit transition phase.“This would be a much cleaner, simpler, unquestionably unionist proposal,” said Boles.His original proposal was dubbed “Norway for now”, and suggested the UK use Efta as a stepping stone towards a more loose Canada-style free trade deal with the EU. However, members of the four-nation bloc rejected temporary membership.A Norway plus model would be opposed by Brexiteers andbreach most of the red lines set by May’s government, but would match the objectives set out by Sturgeon and Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer.“I’ve had conversations with some of [Ms Sturgeon’s] MPs down here and I’m very open to have further such conversations,” said Boles. “I’d be delighted to discuss with anyone in the SNP. “I’ve had discussions with Plaid Cymru MPs, with Labour MPs, with DUP MPs, and crucially with Scottish Conservatives, many of whom were not totally comfortable with the temporary idea in my original formulation.“For many of them, going into the EEA before the end of the transition, before December  is very attractive. You’d obviously get control of fisheries immediately.”Several Scottish Tories are understood to be supportive of an Efta fall-back, but one, Gordon MP Colin Clark, said he still wanted a Canada-style trade deal. “Norway would see us continuing to pay around £bn a year in contributions to the EU, and that’s not where we want to be,” he said.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Sunday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it. It’s like a wee family.

And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renowned west belfast artist to set out stall at culturlann","story":"PROLIFIC West Belfast painter and illustrator Tony Bell is set to unveil a personal retrospective exhibition entitled ‘Special People Special Places’ at the Cultúrlann on Thursday November .

These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs. This is an intolerable situation for the NASUWT, we are committed to defending the rights of our members in this school and hope that a constructive engagement can begin soon with the employers to fully address the situation.”A spokesperson for the CCMS, which oversees St Patrick#s said: “CCMS fully appreciates the right of teachers to take industrial action. However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mps to vote on theresa mays brexit deal before christmas","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Furthermore, few predicted that one of the biggest threats to the deal would eventually come from Brexiteer MPs when, in the early stages of the negotiations, Remain campaigners took the Government to the highest court in the land in order to secure a meaningful vote for MPs. This Commons vote is the major hurdle Mrs May must now overcomeher hard-won deal is to be enshrined in UK law. The vote is expected to take place before MPs break for Christmas in December.Eurosceptic rejection\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Boris Johnson speaking during the DUP annual conference in Belfast Led by figures including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, a swathe of Brexiteer Tories have rejected Mrs May’s deal and called for it to be renegotiated. This raises the prospect of some of Mrs May’s own MPs voting against the agreement when it goes before the Commons. Appearing at the DUP conference on Saturday, Mr Johnson said the deal will leave the UK a “satellite state” of the EU. In the Sunday Express Mr Rees-Mogg said the deal “does not deliver” on Brexit and “instead of taking back control, in some areas it will leave the United Kingdom with even less control than it currently has: the vassal state”.DUP oppositionLIVE: Watch Rt Hon Arlene Foster MLA - Party Leader’s Address at the #DUP Party Conference in Belfast  https:w… https:t.co yhGYiTEN— DUPNovember , The Eurosceptics’ rejection of the plans stems in large part from the deal’s backstop provision for the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Hardline Brexiteers say it risks the UK being unable to ever fully leave the EU. The DUP say the backstop would see Northern Ireland adopt a dferent regulatory regime to Great Britaina wider UK EU trade deal fails to materialise. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the draft deal fails to protect the Union. With  MPs in the Commons, their support could be crucial for Mrs May’s deal to pass.Labour opposition\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn with shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer Labour repeatedly warned that they would vote against any deal that does not pass six tests. Among the requirements are that it delivers the “exact same” benefits, fair management of migration and the protection of workers’ rights and protections. On Wednesday Jeremy Corbyn branded the deal as “botched” and a “leap in the dark”. “ breaches the Prime Minister’s own red lines and does not meet our six tests”, he said.Uncertain futureMy letter to the nation. #BackTheBrexitDeal pic VGzNeeXoqg— Theresa MayNovember , There is growing speculation that the deal will be voted down by MPs in its current form, although the PM is expected to have several weeks to build support. Aware of the widespread opposition among MPs, Mrs May is appealing directly to the public. On Saturday she issued a “letter to the nation” in which she urged Britons to get behind the deal. She has also sought the backing of business in an effort to encourage MPs to support the deal.What happensit is voted down BFE: Have you written, emailed or visited YOUR MP yet  Have you told them what you think of Mays Deal for your country  The easy to use new #PeoplesVote tool makes it a doddle!

On Saturday Chancellor Philip Hammond warned that rejecting the deal would leave Britain in “uncharted territory”, while he said a no-deal Brexit would unleash “economic chaos”.Could another deal be struck The Sundayfront page: Secret Plan B for Brexit #tomorrowspaperstoday pic ociuKaMbw— The November , EU leaders have warned they will notto the negotiating table, however a no-deal Brexit would have damaging consequences for both the UK and EU countries.

Negotiators have until the end of the transition period, which could run until the end of , to strike a deal.

And we’ll continue to have tarf free and quota free trade between Britain and Ireland which is very important for our economy.” The summit went ahead after Spain claimed the UK and European Union had agreed to its demands for guarantees over the status of Gibraltar. British Prime Minister Theresa May held meetings with EU chiefs Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk on Saturday evening to finalise details. While not necessary, the deal was also approved in the Irish parliament on Wednesday.

treatment for a rare spinal condition in that hope that it will be made available to children in the North.Donna Ferris’ three year-old son Charlie was diagnosed with progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis when he was just six months old.If left untreated, the spinal deformity can lead to severe twisting of the spine, respiratory problems and even decreased le expectancy.When little Charlie was first diagnosed back in February , doctors in Belfast told his anxious parents Donna and Jodie that their only option was to put their son in a plaster jacket to hold in the curve in his spine until he was old enough for surgery.However, determined Donna vowed to do everything in her power to keep her baby son away from the operating table and invasive surgery.After hours of online research, the mum-of-four found a hospital in the United States which offers specialised scoliosis treatment.Donna discovered that Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia offered advanced treatment which could potentially avoid surgery.She said: “When I was researching I checked for hospitals in the east coast of America as I knew it would be easier to fly into there from Ireland.  I came across Shriners Hospital and made contact straight away askingthey accepted international patients.  They said they did and sent me some forms which I filled in.  Within four days of applying to the hospital for the treatment Charlie was accepted, and within a month he was at the hospital.”On April , , Donna, Jodie and their four kids made the trip to Philadelphia for Charlie’s first appointment.Just a few days later, Charlie was fitted with a Mehta cast which was specially designed to correct the curve in his spine.Over the last  months, Charlie has made the same journey  times.Before having his first cast fitted, the curvature in Charlie’s spine was at a -degree angle.Earlier this month, during their th trip to Shriners Hospital, the Ferris family received the news they had been hoping for.“They took Charlie’s brace off  hours after arriving at the hospital and sent him for x-rays.  After this the doctors brought us in and gave us the great news that Charlie’s spine is now down to six degrees,” said Donna.“I just burst into tears crying.  I just couldn’t believe it.  The staff at the hospital were also crying and hugging us.  They were just so, so happy.  They are always willing the children on there.  It was just amazing news to get.”Donna said before starting his treatment in the US, Charlie was a ‘very restless baby’ and she ‘really struggled to get food into him’.Now, she says her son is a completely dferent person.“The boy we have now is just perfect.  He is meeting all his milestones and is doing everything a wee child of his age should be doing and he will go on to lead a healthy le,” she said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Charlie knows that he’s dferent and he has to wear a brace that not everyone  does but he’s adapted to it all from the get-go, he’s just brilliant.“The plan now is that Charlie will remain in brace until June next year and then he will switch to a night time brace for six months at least.  Hopefully he will not have to wear a brace at all eventually.”Following Charlie’s diagnosis and the news that he would have to travel to America for the specialised treatment, the Ballinderry and wider community set about fundraising for the family to help fund their travel, something which the Ferris family are ever grateful for.Donna also has nothing but praise for Shriners Hospital.“Words cannot describe how grateful we are to the hospital for what they have done for us,” she said.“When we first took him to the hospital we knew Charlie was going to be in expert hands as they specialise in infantile scoliosis.“We are so, so grateful to them and it’s very hard to put into words how good they all are.  They don’t just treat Charlie, they treat the whole family.  It’s the same people treating Charlie each and every time and he has become so familiar with them all.“Shriners is a non-profit hospital and they treat families regardless of their ability to pay.  All the time we have been there we have never received a bill from them.  To go half way across the world to another hospital and not be billed is just amazing.”Charlie’s journey over the last  months has been well documented by Donna on a Facebook page named ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’.Through the page, other parents in similar situations have reached out to Donna who has offered them support and advice.  She has also given them ‘hope of what can be achieved’.On November , Donna attended the Families First awards ceremony in Sligo Park Hotel where she was presented with an ‘Inspirational Person’ award – an accolade which she had been nominated for by a parent from Co Cavan.“I spoke to the audience and told them our story and I received a standing ovation afterwards.  I was just overwhelmed by how many people I have touched out there.  It was the perfect end to the perfect week.”Donna now hopes that by speaking out about Charlie’s treatment that it will give other children hope.“The treatment that Charlie received at Shriners Hospital has been available at Great Ormond Street Hospital since July this year however I really want it to become available across the UK and Ireland.“Charlie is living proof of what can be achieved by this gentle, non-invasive treatment so why not offer it to babies here and give them a chance.“I want to be able to help other children in our own country and want parents not to have to feel the need to travel abroad for adequate care.  I would just love to see this treatment available here so there is hope for other families.”To follow Charlie’s progress visit ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’ on Facebook."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOFxcXC8xMVxcXC8yMzE3Mjc0NFxcXC9TY3JlZW4tU2hvdC0yMDE4LTEwLTEyLWF0LTE1LjQ2LjEyLTc1MHgzNTAucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmRlcnJ5bm93LmNvbVxcXC9hc3NldHNcXFwvaVxcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmc_dj0xXCJ9IiwiaGFzaCI6Ijk3MmMxMTk4ZmE5YWU1MzJmN2Q4ODNmMTdkODBlMzc4Mjg5MWY1NmIifQ==/screen-shot-2018-10-12-at-15-46-12-750x350.png","title":"irish filmmaker wants james bulger film screened derry reopen debate case","story":"The writer and director of an award-winning film about the murder of Liverpool toddler, James Bulger, screening in Derry this weekend, said he hopes the film will open up a new debate on what made two -year-old boys murder a child.Vincent Lambe’s film, ‘Detainment’, is based on the true story of James Bulger, abducted in Liverpool in  and found brutally murdered two days later. However, the most shocking aspect of the case was that the main suspects were just children themselves - two ten-year-old boys, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. Based on their interview transcripts, the film dramatizes the police interviews which took place at the time.Detainment stars Will O’Connell , David Ryan , Tara Breathnach , Morgan C. Jones , Brian Fortune , Kathy Monahan , and introduces two exceptional young actors, Ely Solan and Leon Hughes.Speaking to the Derry News, Vincent Lamb said that he hopes the film will challenge public perception of the boys who committed the murder and open a wider debate on the matter.When asked what drew him to the story, he replied: “I was asked that same question when I was over in London where I did an interview for Sky News the UK audience find it strange that an Irish filmmaker would be interested in something so deeply rooted in the British consciousness.“But it affected the people here in Ireland just as much as the people in the UK. I was  at the time it happened and I remember it very well.“I remember growing up hearing about it and heard it mentioned again as an adult and it was unexpected how I felt about it at the time.“I started reading everything I could find on it and then I got the transcripts [of the police interviews] and felt that I was seeing something not everyone  was seeing.”SensitiveVincent said that casting the child actors for the roles of Thompson and Venables was challenging but that the young actors, Ely Solanand Leon Hughes , who have been critically-acclaimed for their astonishing performances, were ‘phenomenal’.“I had a lot of apprehension about making a film on such a sensitive story,” he said.“The public outrage at the time was unprecedented and it hasn’t gone away, it’s still there. So many people just seen these boys as being evil and couldn’t cope with the fact that they were just two little boys. The only way they could make sense of it was to see them as evil.“Newspapers labelled them as ‘evil monsters’, the spawn of Satan’ and ‘freaks of nature. People hadn’t really looked at other points of view andyou did, you were criticised – people couldn’t see any other reason for it other than they were evil.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“When I was , I accepted that they must have been evil but as an adult when I researched it a bit more, my opinion altered and I hope that this film will help other people change their minds.“By looking into the boys’ family background, I got a better understanding of what could have led two -year-old boys to commit such a horrible crime.“This film is not sympathetic to the boys and is not trying to make an excuse for them in any way but it humanises them. People may be more comfortable thinking of them as evil monsters but, after reading the transcripts, it was a tragedy for three families and that’s not a popular opinion.“The film is entirely factual, there is no embellishment – it is almost entirely verbatim. When I was making the film, given my apprehensions, it was very important to me that everything was factual.”‘Prevent this happening again’Vincent said that he was especially nervous when he heard that journalist and expert of the James Bulger murder, David James Smith, was attending one a screening of the film at the Winchester Film Festival. Smith wrote a book on the matter, The Sleep of Reason: The James Bulger Case.“He turned up at the last screening in the UK and I was terried,” he said.“He’s such an expert on the case, I was dreading to hear what he thought but he said the film was ‘authentic’ and a ‘remarkable achievement’ which was an amazing endorsement.“He also wrote a lovely review saying thatthe audience were willing to find the truth out about those boys, they could not ignore their inescapable smallness.”“People don’t talk about this case enough, butyou have any other opinion other than the boys were monsters, it’s rejected and it stles debate on the issue. We want to prevent this happening again so we need to understand the case.“I remember the Judge’s comments about the boys and I thought it was a ludicrous decision to name them but the more I read, the more I understood his reasons – he wanted a discussion about it, to look into the background of the boys and see how something like could be prevented from ever happening again. I hope that people will debate the case again after watching the film.”Vincent finally had a word for the Bulger family: “I don’t want anyone to think that I don’t have sympathy for the Bulger family, I have enormous sympathy for little James, for what he went through and what his family have been through.”‘Detainment’ by award-winning director, writer and producer, Vincent Lambe and Irish producer, Darren Mahon, will screen at Foyle Film Festival in the Nerve Centre on Sunday, November , at pm.More information about the film and upcoming screenings can be found at: www.detainmentfilm"},{"url":null,"title":"people derry urged think twice visiting emergency department winter emerges ae altnagelvin dealing 230 people","story":"UP to  people are visiting the Accident and Emergency department in Altnagelvin Hospital every day, it has emerged.The figure emerged at Novembers meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Community meeting, where senior figures from the Western Trust were in attendance to discuss its Winter Resilience Plan  .Speaking at the meeting Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals with the Trust, said that ‘demands’ were already very high on its services as it had experienced an increase in the numbers of people attending the AE department at Altnagelvin over the past year.She told the meeting that the eight per cent increase over the past year meant that the hospital was now dealing with  to  people on a daily basis, compared to a figure of  to  every day last year.Mrs McKay added that the bulk of people attending the department were Category  and Category  patients, who she said were the ‘sickest patients with the most complex needs’, adding that these patients would be in need of ‘immediate attention’, and required treatment within an hour.The meeting was told that the emergency department was facing additional pressures due to issues with gaining accesses to beds within the unit, adding that there also had been an increase in the numbers of people who have had to wait over  hours for treatment.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMrs McKay continued that it would be issuing an appeal through the media urging people to consider their condition before attending the local Accident and Emergency department.“We do believe there will be a tough winter ahead of us all, and we hope you can disseminate that information to people that they may not need to attend the Emergency Department,” she told the meeting.Mrs McKay also spoke of the extreme pressure placed on the department last winter due to the outbreak of the norovirus, and also urged people to take advice from their GPs on their condition before attending the AE.However, she also stressed thatpeople do feel that they must attend the unit, then they should not ‘take any chances’.“Go to your GP and take the advice,” Mrs McKay said.“If you need to the be there , then you need to there, because there are people who put off going there over the fear that there may be already large numbers there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"angela receives highest uk air ambulance honour","story":"WAA Chief Executive Angela Hughes receives her Letime Achievement Award.\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Angela receives highest UK Air Ambulance HonourWAArsquos fleet of four helicopters.\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"visiting tangent clubs luminary on hand to switch on llandrindod wells christmas lights","story":"Prize winners in the decorated lantern competitionreceive their prizes as Sue ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtHill presents Sophialtspan classtruncate-full-screengt Morgan with her first place award.

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though.

The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out. Olympic deserved to win, but it was cruel on the Young Men.Ballynahinch Olympic II: R Connolly, J Roddy, D Russell, N McGlew, M Rice, S Marmion, J Fennell, G Wilson, R Patterson, D Travers, S Rodgers.

The problems of vandalism and high running costs have made it virtually impossible to keep going any longer.Crisis points are no strangers to the harassed members of the hall committee. Two years ago they ran into trouble when funds for the hall completely petered out.The hall fell into an appalling state of disrepair and a public appeal to raise pound, was launched. Only pound, was raised and since then the management committee have an uphill battle to survive.While the hall belongs to the community and is run by a committee appointed at public meetings, the nature of the trust deed, under which it is held, means that it cannot be taken over or run by the district council.The hallrsquos usefulness became redundant as the old style of social s was replaced by nights out at licensed restaurants and by public house entertainment.Mrs Katie Williams, the committee treasurer, said: ldquoAlthough we still have money problems, the main thing we have to break down is apathy among the townspeople.

If anyone sees a route we have missed, please lest us know.Maurice added: ldquoWe hope that future editions can both improve the content and mapping of North Lecale and cover the Lecale coastline all the way to Dundrum Bay.ldquoThe book would make a wonderful Christmas present for anyone who loves Lecale or anyone with relatives aboard this Christmas who want to be reminded of the beautul Barony of Lecale and the local history of each parish. We have fully funded this publication so every book sold goes to develop local community walking routes and it will be available in most local shops.Cllr Enright said he was grateful for the knowledge and support he had received from older people ldquosteeped in folklore from every village and townland over the past year in producing the book as well as the invaluable technical expertise of his co-author Duane.ldquoPeople like Terry Swail, from Kilclief, Portaferryrsquos Lennie Lawson and Vincie Curran, from Myra, gave their time freely and ungrudgingly to make this publication such a success, he said.Councillor Enright said the book emerged from the process of developing village plans over the past five years with many public consultations highlighting the need for safe, off-road walking routes to keep people active and healthy.ldquoEvery village wanted to know how their walks could be integrated into the wider network of trails around Lecale, he continued. ldquoThere was a demand to know the details of the law and how they could assert local walking routes in their area.ldquoResidentsrsquo associations in the Downpatrick area led by those in Stream Street actually commissioned technical reports into how walks like the four kilometre Quoile River Walk could once again be integrated with the network of parks like Delamont and Castle Ward.Cllr Enright added: ldquoThey wanted cycleways on new greenways to Dundrum, Ballynahinch, Belfast and Comber following old railway lines and we packed all this information into the book with maps, photographs and references. I am sure that anyone with an interest in these matters will find it an invaluable reference document for their endeavours.The new publication has also been given a ringing endorsement by Dr Tim Campbell, Director of the Saint Patrick Centre in Downpatrick.He said: ldquoThis book illustrates how Downpatrickrsquos tourism hub around the Cathedral, Down County Museum and the Mound of Down could be linked off-road to every village in Lecale and rejoin the local way-marked trails like the Saint Patrickrsquos Way and Ulster Way to make a network of walks and cycle paths in East Down.The new book is available at Kevin Ogrsquos shop in Strangford, the St. Patrick Centre, The Road Houses Bar, Oakley Fayre, Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre.

Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

OK, he and his we have jetted off to Lanzarote to get a break from work, the weather and, of course, the furore over Brexit. Sandra ChapmanHe wouldn’t normally decide to take a break at this time of year. But, as a Brexiteer, he says he has had his fill of politicians, politics and the  promises over Brexit. He says he will be back, but threatens to emigratethe country falls apart.He got a lot of sympathy from Himself who also has flown off this week to the British mainland leaving me with just the dog, which I’m pretty sure is happy to get a bit of peace and quiet from the pair of us who really haven’t been able to argue in any logical fashion about the political crisis surrounding us. Dogs are wonderful at pretending they understand everything you say especiallyyou are saying it near the cupboard where the treats reside.The whole sorry saga of Brexit is impossible to escape.I was about to roll up a page of newspaper to light the fire only to be drawn to the headline at the top: ‘The EU will turn us into captiveswe sign up to this appalling sell-out.’ It was the latest rant in the Dailyfrom Boris Johnson, who wants the Northern Ireland backstop scrapped with both sidesto simply ‘commit to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland by the use of new unobtrusive checks and discussions of the future economic partnership’ where, he says ‘the Irish discussion rightly belongs’.suitcases packed.That was the day before Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald was shouting at the top of her voice about the DUP being out of step on Brexit and ‘must face reality’. Now, I wonder what that reality might be  Seconds later she was urging Arlene Foster to “wake up and smell the coffee”. This is the very same Mary Lou who claims to have “no regrets” over her handling of the Mairia Cahill case. Mary Lou can shout all she wants. Only her own side will be listening.The Northern Ireland born Labour MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey had a lot to say this week too. Ms Hoey informs us she has “ploughed through” the  pages of the proposed withdrawal agreement plus the explanation notes – that makes her a hero in my eyes – and declares that “Northern Ireland, to all intents and purposes, becomes separated in many ways from the rest of the United Kingdom”, with the backstop arrangements looking like they were written by the Irish government.All in all it means that the Republic of Ireland would, effectively, be representing Northern Ireland in the EU, she believes. A highly respected politician, one not given to exaggeration, I would say she has got it right. That was one page of newspaper I saved from the flames.Then, of course, there are the Scots whose nationalism is getting a fresh kick from the Brexit chaos.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, accuses Theresa May of asking people to “take a blindfold leap off a clf” with her Brexit deal. Ms Sturgeon, as we all know, has her heart set on independence for Scotland. She may yet be successful second time around. How amazing it is that women are playing such a big role in the whole Brexit saga.Years ago Margaret Thatcher had the political field all to herself. Had she been in charge today she would long ago have hand-bagged Jean-Claude Junker and the elegant Mr Barnier into submission. Theresa May, on the other hand, looks like the one being hand-bagged.Legacy Scandal: The IRA was able to wage terrorism on Castlederg because it was near the safe haven of the Irish Republic Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"So when does this crisis begin to calm down so that the rest of us can get on with planning our Christmas  It’s not looking good.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.
