He is pictured here in a 2007 yearbook photo On the field, Hernandez and Dennis SanSoucie worked in perfect harmony for Bristol Central High School\u0027s football team.Hernandez shined as a pass receiver with SanSoucie, the Bristol Rams\u0027 quarterback.  In the first four games of their junior year, the pair had nine touchdown completions. That year alone Hernandez would catch 67 passes for a total of 1,807 yards, smashing state records and catching the attention of top college recruiters across the country. But off the field he was developing a connection with SanSoucie that went far deeper than sport. The pair first began exploring a sexual relationship in middle school, which SanSoucie revealed continued into high school. In high school Hernandez began to date Shayanna Jenkins, who would later become his fiancee and mother of his child.\u0027Me and him were very much into trying to hide what we were doing,\u0027 SanSoucie, who later joined the US Marines, told the Globe. \u0027We didn\u0027t want people to know.\u0027 That was partially due to their traditional community, but also in large part due to Hernandez\u0027s own home.  Hernandez (pictured in 2007) shined as a pass receiver with SanSoucie, the team quarterback          In the first four games of their junior year, the pair had nine touchdown completions. But off the field he was developing a connection with SanSoucie that went far deeper than sportTo outside observers, Hernandez\u0027s father Dennis was the ultimate supportive dad. When he suddenly died at the age of 49, during his younger son\u0027s junior year, many believed it crushed Hernandez and marked the beginning of his downfall.           The pair first began exploring a sexual relationship in middle school, which SanSoucie said continued into high school. Pictured is SanSoucie in 2007But his brother has since revealed that their father ran a home where  homophobia was rampant and abuse was the ultimate motivational tool.Jonathan Hernandez, the NFL star\u0027s older brother, said his father long had concerns that Hernandez \u0027had a feminine way about him\u0027.He closely watched at how his youngest son \u0027stood or used his hands\u0027. And he became enraged when a young Hernandez expressed interest in cheerleading. \u0027He wanted to be a cheerleader. My cousins were cheerleaders and amazing,\u0027 Jonathan, 32, recalled. \u0027And I remember coming home and my dad put an end to that real quick. And it was not okay. My dad made it clear that he had his definition of a man.\u0027 Their father also frequently threw around the term \u0027f****t\u0027, which Jonathan said he used \u0027all the time\u0027.           \u0027Me and him were very much into trying to hide what we were doing,\u0027 SanSoucie, who later joined the US Marines, told the Globe. \u0027We didn\u0027t want people to know\u0027          SanSoucie himself only decided to come out to his family and friends after Hernandez\u0027s death. \u0027I really, truly feel in my heart I got the thumbs-up from him,\u0027 he said\u0027Standing. Talking. Acting. Looking. It was the furthest thing my father wanted you to even look like in our household,\u0027 he said. \u0027This was not acceptable to him.\u0027 And Dennis Hernandez was a man to be feared in the Hernandez household, ruling his sons with an iron fist. Sometimes they came as punishment, such as when their father left Hernandez with a black eye because he drank before a school dance.Sometimes they came when their father felt his boys weren\u0027t working hard enough in school or at football. Other times they came for no discernible reason at all.One time it got so bad that Jonathan threatened to call the authorities. But Dennis Hernandez remained unfazed.           But his brother has since revealed that Hernandez\u0027s father Dennis (pictured with his brother Jonathan) ran a home where homophobia was rampant          Jonathan Hernandez said their father Dennis long had concerns that Hernandez \u0027had a feminine way about him\u0027. The brothers are pictured here together while he was playing for the Patriots\u0027I picked up the phone once to call, to seek help,\u0027 he recalled. \u0027And his response was. Call them.\u0027\u0027And he handed me the phone, and he said I\u0027m going to beat you even harder, you and your brother, and they\u0027re going to have to pull me off of you when they knock down the door.\u0027  Hernandez would later tell both Jonathan and one of his lawyers, George Leontire, about the sexual abuse he suffered as a child. Both Jonathan and Leontire - who later said that Hernandez \u0027clearly was gay\u0027 - have refused to name his abuser.   Their father Dennis also threw around the term f****t, which Jonathan said he used \u0027all the time\u0027 while the boys were growing up. Pictured is Hernandez in his 2007 yearbook photoA college girlfriend later revealed that Hernandez had also told her about being molested as a child, saying: \u0027He never dealt with it. It led to issues in his sexuality\u0027.  It was just one of many secrets that appeared to torture Hernandez in his short adult life, to be revealed only after he committed suicide in his jail cell in April 2017. SanSoucie himself only decided to come out to his family and friends after Hernandez\u0027s death. \u0027I really, truly feel in my heart I got the thumbs-up from him,\u0027 he said. Hernandez\u0027s shocking suicide came five days after he was acquitted of the murder of Odin Lloyd and two years after he had been sentenced to life in prison. His family later donated Hernandez\u0027s brain to Boston University, which found that the 27-year-old suffered from the most severe case of CTE ever found in a person his age.The former New England Patriots star reportedly took his own life two days after he was outed on The Kirk \u0026amp Callahan Show.            Hernandez\u0027s fiancee Shayanna Jenkins said she had no clue about his sexuality until after he killed himself           The former New England Patriots star reportedly took his own life two days after he was outed on The Kirk \u0026amp Callahan Show, which came five days after he was acquitted of murder He was called a \u0027tight end on and off the field\u0027 and a \u0027wide receiver\u0027 on the show. But, as she did throughout his murder trial and after his death, Jenkins-Hernandez remained one of his ultimate defenders. \u0027I saw no indication that he was gay or homosexual. I wish I had known how he felt, just so we could have talked about it,\u0027 Jenkins-Hernandez wrote in a foreword for a book about Hernandez\u0027s final days.\u0027I\u0027m NOT gay\u0027: Lindsey Graham responds to Chelsea Handler\u0027s...Emotional moment TV host comes out on morning show saying he...Share this article\u0027I wouldn\u0027t have disowned him,\u0027 she continued. \u0027I would have been supportive.

Campaigners say dogs rarely die in one shot and are left twitching in agony in their final moments.Officially, the bodies are then transported out of the cities for safe burial - but photos of bodies in lakes and on roadsides have raised fears that this is not always the case.

The treatment uses LED light therapy to increase collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid production, which enhances the complexion.Her skin certainly looked flawless on Friday, with a hint of her natural freckles showing through.

I’d expected to be among, let’s face it, be-Union-Jacked fruitcakes and a few passing Japanese tourists for this, the wedding of a radiant but minor Royal.I can’t help but laugh when the woman next to me, Sheryl Arredondo, who arrived last night from Michigan and is sporting Union Jack nail polish, tells me the presenters on ITV have been debating how to pronounce the bride’s name: ‘Is it EUgenee or EuJANEee?’No one’s ever said it much, I tell her. I’m someone who has found it hard to distinguish Eugenie from her older sister, Beatrice.‘When I told my co-workers I was coming over for the wedding, they had no idea who she was,’ Sheryl says. ‘Until I said that Fergie’s her mum.’ So why on earth has she travelled all this way? ‘I’m 66. This might be the last Royal Wedding I get the chance to see.’As more people arrive, and ooh and aah at the castle, it becomes clear the reason we’re here is to be able to say we were part of history we were there.It’s not just another society knees-up, so many people – young and old – tell me: ‘The bride is the Queen’s granddaughter.’Even if we don’t know everything about her, there’s huge affection washing around, keeping us warm: ‘Eugenie is one of the quieter ones,’ admit Julie and Malcolm, now expats in Sydney. ‘We miss all this,’ they add, taking in the pomp and the pageantry. I meet Alexis and Sol, both 20, here from the US. ‘I love the fact Eugenie has a job!’ says Alexis.  Ooze sophistication like Demi in a custom-made dress by Stella McCartneyShop the current collectionAs anticipated, the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank was a star-studded affair with attendees including Victoria Beckham, Amal Clooney and Ellie Goulding. But it was Demi Moore who won serious style points in a custom-made dress by Stella McCartney.This elegant design featured a demure neckline, short fluted sleeves, cinched waist and figure-hugging fit, which created a sophisticated aesthetic. She completed her look with Gabriela Hearst’s ‘Demi’ satin bag and a delicate headdress by Stephen Jones. The gorgeous Bordeaux shade of her ensemble couldn’t be more fitting for this season. In fact, this hue is universally flattering, so we can all try it out!

But, to my huge surprise, no one’s interested not even 25-year-olds Lewis and Sydney, here on a date. They only have eyes for the Windsors. ‘I think Kate looks tired,’ says a mum with a screaming toddler in a pushchair.As I bring up each famous face on my screen, my little group squints and grimaces. At Naomi Campbell: ‘Let’s hope no one p***es her off!’ At Cara Delevingne, who has turned up in top hat and tails: ‘Has no one told her, today isn’t all about you!’ At Ricky Martin, there’s a simple: ‘Why?’The most opprobrium comes from Rav Singh, a 57-year-old former IT worker, currently caring for his dad. He thinks the Royals who court celebs are playing a dangerous game.

Family-of-seven must BULLDOZE brand new luxury...Share this article    The Mail on Sunday\u0027s Liz Jones with Joseph Afrane at Windsor for the Royal Wedding‘Look at David Beckham, getting out of that speeding ticket. If you’re photographed next to him, what does that say about you?’ I tell him Posh and Becks are a no-show, but that Jimmy Carr is here. ‘You see?’ he says. ‘Tax avoiders. They need to be careful. It looks like the Firm are fawning over famous people. They should stick to inviting European dignitaries, not models.’I counter that the British Royal Family has always courted the famous. Diana was friends with Elton John and Gianni Versace. Several women give me an ‘off with her head’ stare. No one is allowed to utter a bad word about Di. ‘She was always much more famous than anyone else,’ I’m told. ‘Eugenie is in danger of being eclipsed.’In fact, throughout the whole day, the only people I meet who are keen to glimpse James Blunt, say, or Robbie Williams – who turns up chewing gum! – is a group of horsey ladies, here rather noisily from the Cotswolds. ‘We went out to the farm shop where they were supposed to be uploading stars on to coaches, but we didn’t even see Ellie Goulding!’ Are they upset? ‘Nah! As long as we see Zara Phillips. We love her!’We watch the ceremony on someone else’s phone, as mine has died. As Eugenie says her vows, ‘I’m shedding a few tears,’ says a 50-year-old former PR who has dealt with her share of selfish, unruly pop stars. ‘It was so romantic and traditional. So English, with those rosy cheeks.’          MISCHIEF: Prince George and his cousin Savannah enjoying themselves at Eugenie\u0027s wedding          Prince George  reacts as he arrives with bridesmaids at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor CastleAs the ceremony draws to a close, everyone straightens and cranes for the moment the carriage containing the couple will flash past. Don’t we think Eugenie is making a bit too much fuss, I whisper to a woman from Wales.‘Every girl dreams of a fuss. She’s spent her life being carer to her parents, she deserves today. I hope they will be happy.’ My goodness, this crowd is generous. What about the £2 million spent on the police? ‘It’s less than was spent on Trump!’When at last the carriage passes the crowd, now four-deep but as bald as William’s head in places, I’m puzzled no great cheer goes up, just a weak titter.‘That’s because we were all taking photos on our phones,’ says a misty-eyed lady.Of course, the stars had been invited, and seemed thrilled, but they will have spent considerable time over the years grooming the young princes and princesses, slicking their own events with magisterial magic. They seem to think they are ‘better’ than the Royals, and by that I don’t just mean better looking.In church, most stars’ eyes swivelled towards Demi Moore, not the Queen. Celebrities always do as they please, too (which I doubt is a luxury Meghan can now enjoy), thinking rules don’t apply to them, which is why some sneakily posted on Instagram from inside the church. Whatever happened to respect?The other wedding that took place on Friday morning was one between celebrity and Royalty. It was a marriage of convenience, one guaranteed to reap the most coverage and viewers, but where will it lead?It implies, with the positioning of the gum-smacking Robbie Williams and his wife so near the Queen, that the famous and the Royals are equal. That they belong to the same club. The one that digs up basements and annoys neighbours, lives in faux Georgian mansions, has affairs and runs out of money. This young batch of Royals (‘they are so good for PR,’ one 55-year-old woman proudly wearing a £5 Eugenie and Jack scarf tells me) have only just got the Firm back on track. Let’s not derail it now.          Even the choice of car to carry the couple from the reception – an Aston Martin made for the James Bond film Spectre – pays homage to fictionThe Royal Family are different, and if they’re not, then why are we paying for them? If Euge! and Jack are no better than Posh and Becks, why should we revere them and wave to them in glass carriages? We will turn into America, where money, not history or duty, rules.I’m sure the Queen has famous friends, but I doubt they snort coke. I wonder, too, at Beatrice’s choice of reading, from The Great Gatsby. It’s a book about spoilt, rich, empty idiots who destroy everything and trample over everyone around them. That’s not the Royal Family. That’s Hollywood.Even the choice of car to carry the couple from the reception – an Aston Martin made for the James Bond film Spectre – pays homage to fiction. There’s a danger the bona fide glamour of the Royals will be tarnished by this constant clamouring for the faux. They will become a chimera, as easy to erase as a Pixar cartoon.Oh, and by the way, Williams was no longer chewing when he emerged after the ceremony.

He was the pope of Francis\u0027 formative years as a young priest in Argentina and was instrumental in giving rise to the Latin American church\u0027s \u0027preferential option for the poor\u0027 that Francis has made his own.Francis also has a close personal connection to Romero, and like him lived through  right-wing military dictatorships when Francis was in Argentina. Francis was responsible for eventually declaring Romero a martyr for his fearless denunciations of the military regime at the start of El Salvador\u0027s 1980-1992 civil war.In his homily, Francis called Paul a \u0027prophet of a church turned outwards\u0027 to care for the faraway poor.

A day before he was killed, he had delivered the latest in a series of sermons demanding an end to the army\u0027s repression - sermons that had enraged El Salvador\u0027s leaders.Almost immediately after his death, Romero became an icon of the South American left and is frequently listed along with Martin Luther King Jr and Mohandas Gandhi as one of the world\u0027s most influential human rights campaigners. The United Nations commemorates the anniversary of his death each year.But his popularity with the left led to a decades-long delay in his saint-making cause at the Vatican, where right-wing cardinals led by Colombian Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo warned that his elevation would embolden Marxist revolutionaries.Eventually Pope Benedict XVI unblocked the cause and Francis saw it through to its conclusion Sunday.

Under his auspices, the church agreed to allow liturgy to be celebrated in the vernacular rather than in Latin and called for greater roles for the laity and improved relations with people of other faiths.Paul is also remembered for his two most important encyclicals, or teaching documents, which have had a profound effect on the church: One denounced the mounting inequality between rich and poor, and the other reaffirmed the Catholic church\u0027s opposition to artificial contraception.   Francis has also adopted the \u0027church of the poor\u0027 ethos that Paul embodied when Paul formally renounced wearing the bejeweled papal tiara.More than 1,000 Hondurans trek to the US border in \u0027March of...Woman has a SWASTIKA carved onto her stomach by supporters...Pope Francis defrocks two bishops caught in Chile\u0027s widening...Pope Francis says having an abortion is like \u0027hiring a...Kim Jong-un invites the POPE to North Korea... as it is...Pope Francis blames the DEVIL for Catholic Church\u0027s sexual...Share this articlePaul is also very important to Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, whom Paul made a cardinal in 1977.

Because he knew they were going to kill him,\u0027 added university professor Julia Lainez.For a long time, efforts to recognise Romero met with heavy opposition from conservative Catholics and the Salvadoran right, who saw veiled Marxism in his sermons.          Catholic faithful look at candles dedicated to  Romero in  Ciudad Barrios, some 102 miles from San SalvadorBut Francis - the first Latin American pope - beatified Romero as a \u0027martyr\u0027 in 2015, to popular acclaim.Paul VI - who encouraged Romero in his struggle - was the first head of the Roman Catholic Church to attempt to reform the Vatican\u0027s powerful and unruly Curia, the church\u0027s governing body. It was a challenge Francis also took on.Romero is praised for standing up for peasant rights in the face of a right-wing backlash which painted him as a radical supporter of \u0027liberation\u0027 theology in his small, impoverished central American nation.On March 24, 1980, the man dubbed the \u0027voice of those without voice\u0027 was shot in the heart, killed by a single bullet as he prepared communion. His killing came at the start of a bloody civil war which claimed some 75,000 lives.Relics of each new saint were carried to the altar - part of a bone for Romero and the shirt Paul VI was wearing when he was stabbed in an assassination attempt at Manila airport in 1970."},{"url":null,"title":"Aaron Hernandez secret high school gay lover speaks out","story":"Dennis SanSoucie (right), Aaron Hernandez\u0027s secret gay lover from middle school and high school, is speaking out for the first time  Family members have also since revealed that Hernandez was molested as a young child.

My cousins were cheerleaders and amazing,\u0027 Jonathan, 32, recalled. \u0027And I remember coming home and my dad put an end to that real quick. And it was not okay. My dad made it clear that he had his definition of a man.\u0027 Their father also frequently threw around the term \u0027f****t\u0027, which Jonathan said he used \u0027all the time\u0027.           \u0027Me and him were very much into trying to hide what we were doing,\u0027 SanSoucie, who later joined the US Marines, told the Globe. \u0027We didn\u0027t want people to know\u0027          SanSoucie himself only decided to come out to his family and friends after Hernandez\u0027s death. \u0027I really, truly feel in my heart I got the thumbs-up from him,\u0027 he said\u0027Standing.

Other times they came for no discernible reason at all.One time it got so bad that Jonathan threatened to call the authorities.

The public vote went as follows:Ariel Kahn – Raising Sparks – 108Naomi Booth – Sealed – 105Will Dean – Dark Pines – 94Rebecca Ley – Sweet Fruit, Sour Land – 24Dervla McTiernan – The Ruin – 14Marc Nash – Three Dreams in the Key of G – 3This meant that Raising Sparks carried two votes through to the final round. But our judges – who also each had one vote – didn’t feel able to add the extra endorsement that would get it over the line. They felt that Kahn’s novel, for all its virtues, relied too much on coincidence, contained too much exposition and didn’t quite realise its attempts at magical realism. The stark poetry and sincerity of Ley’s novel, in contrast, made them certain in their choice. It’s also notable that this novel rewarded rereading more than others on the list. As you can see from my earlier piece, Sweet Fruit, Sour Land wasn’t my favourite novel – but that makes this choice so much the better and so much the more interesting. The judges weren’t swayed by my opinions or suggestions about other books and were absolutely solid in their decision. It surprised me – but again, I’m taking that as a positive.

It will shut a further 142 stores by the end of the year, following 46 recently announced store closures. The company had 506 Sears stores and 360 Kmart stores in August.The bankruptcy, which Sears said would help it to restructure its business, comes after years of decline. Once a symbol of the American lifestyle that prided itself on selling everything to everyone, it has been losing out to rival retailers Walmart and Amazon.“The company believes that a successful reorganization will save the company and the jobs of tens of thousands of store associates,” Sears said.The Sears workforce has dwindled to about 68,000 from 302,000 a decade ago. It has been run over that period by the hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert, who sold off many of the firm’s brands and properties but failed to win back customers, many of whom now prefer to shop online.For generations, Sears served working-class homeowners hoping to buy high-quality products by offering them monthly instalment programmes.

So what do people think?One month after the French channel port of Dunkirk introduced free public transport for all, a small revolution is taking place.Two women, perfect strangers until now, are chatting across the aisle about nothing in particular. One admits she sometimes takes the bus “just for the fun of it”. A young man wearing headphones is charging his mobile in a socket just above the “request stop” button.On another bus, Claude Pointart, 65, who is retired, says free buses mean her pension goes further. “I’m saving money and they come every 10 minutes so I don’t have to wait long. But there’s a lot more people taking the bus so you have to avoid the rush hour if you want to sit. Still, I think it’s a good thing.”On a city bus making its way around the historic port city, passengers smile at the driver and say “Bonjour” as they board. Some of the city’s fleet of new buses, painted in dazzling colours – pink, orange, green, yellow and blue, with upholstery to match – have wifi. The urban authorities have plans for debates, music and possibly the occasional celebrity on board. A “Sport-Bus” with an interactive game, quiz screen and a selfie camera is already in operation.Georges Contamin, 51, says he has reconsidered how he travels about the city since the buses became fare-free. “Before, I almost never took the bus, but the fact they are now free as well as the increase in the cost of car fuel has made me reflect on how I get about,” Contamin says.At the bus stop opposite the port, even the persistent drizzle and howling wind rocking the boats cannot dampen Marie’s enthusiasm. “I never used the bus before,” she says. “It was too much bother getting tickets or a pass. Now I leave the car at home and take the bus to and from work. It’s so easy.”One month ago, Dunkirk – with a metropolitan population of 200,000 – became the largest city in Europe to offer free public transport. There are no trams, trolleybuses or local commuter trains, but the hop-on-hop-off buses are accessible and free – requiring no tickets, passes or cards – for all passengers, even visitors .The scheme took its inspiration from Tallinn in Estonia, which in 2013 became the first European capital to offer a fare-free service on buses, trams and trolleybuses, but only to residents who are registered with the municipality. They pay €2 for a “green card”, after which all journeys are free. The city has reported an increase of 25,000 in the number of registered residents – the number previously stood at 416,000 – for which the local authorities receives €1,000 of each resident’s income tax every year.In February this year, Germany announced it was planning to trial free public transport in five cities – including the former capital Bonn and industrial cities Essen and Mannheim. In June this was downgraded to a slashing of public transport fares to persuade people to ditch cars.A study into free public transport by online journal politics found an increase in mobility among older and younger people, and an increased sense of freedom.“The subject of free public transport is full of dogma and prejudice and not much research. This dogma suggests that if something is free it has no value. We hear this all the time in France,” he says.Bus routes have been extended, with special lanes and city centre priority introduced. The fleet has been expanded from 100 to 140 buses, including new greener vehicles which run on natural gas.“The increase in passengers since it went free has surprised us now we have to keep them. We’re trying to make people look at buses differently. We have put the bus back into people’s head as a means of transport, and it has changed attitudes.“Before the bus was for those who had no choice: the young, the old, the poor who don’t have cars. Now it’s for everyone.”Free public transport, however, also has its critics. The French transport union UTP believes fare-free transport is often “associated in France with a lack of value and, by extension, a lack of respect”.In Paris the income from tickets on public transport is reported to make up half the running costs. When mayor Anne Hidalgo suggested she would look at scrapping fares, Frédéric Héran, a transport economist, said the measure “made no sense”.“Who will the new public transport users be?” he asked. “All studies have shown they will be cyclists, then pedestrians and very few motorists. This clearly shows it’s an anti-cycling, anti-pedestrian measure and not very discouraging to cars.”Vergriete believes this is all part of an erroneous received dogma. He admits free public transport may not work everywhere, but says that, as well as being good for the environment, it is a social measure, a gesture of “solidarity” and promotes a more egalitarian redistribution of wealth than tax cuts.“We have been pragmatic: we looked at the advantages of free transport and weighed them against the disadvantages and decided €7m is not a lot to pay for all the benefits. If I can pass one message to other mayors it’s to fight the dogma. Put the advantages and disadvantages on the table and consider it realistically. It may be that the financial cost is too great, but don’t underestimate the social advantages. You can’t put a price on mobility and social justice.”Additional reporting by Emmanuelle DepeckerFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e74a0a8fc515f6b65ca1a55c35281a05d2537db/0_12_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc05e16acc921a7c1d9e827e393fa3eb","title":"sensitive images upsetting photos essential truthful account","story":"Pictures can be upsetting, so a lot of time is spent considering, and reconsidering, their usageKhalid Masood was lawfully shot dead by police after he killed five people at Westminster in March 2017, a coroner’s inquest in London concluded on Friday. Over several days of covering the hearing,  editors had access to a limited range of images of Masood. For one report they used a photo of him taken in the Great Mosque of Mecca, Islam’s holiest site.Some Muslim readers expressed to me concern that the image linked a particularly important aspect of their religion to the awful crimes of this inidual. One of the five pillars of Islam is for Muslims, if physically and financially capable, to make the hajj, a pilgrimage to the site, at least once in their lifetime.From an editorial standards perspective, there was nothing wrong with the image. Legitimately obtained, it depicted a smiling Masood dressed in the traditional white, and behind him the Ka’bah, the great cube, around which pilgrims walk seven times.Conscious that the Muslim community can suffer discrimination when terrorist acts are committed in the name of a political ideology that feigns religiosity, as a gesture of goodwill the editors replaced the photo for another image, a police mugshot. Muslims who had raised the issue were appreciative.It is essential that journalists cover the crimes that constitute terrorism, and the legal processes which follow. Coverage can justifiably include images of perpetrators but should take care not to glorify them. Had the photo related directly to evidence given in the inquest it might have been necessary to retain it.A different case of image sensitivity arose from an online gallery of 29 photographs taken at Tarragona, Spain, where teams compete to form the highest and most complex tower of interlinked humans. A feature of Catalan culture, the “castellers” demonstrate great feats of strength, balance and daring but most of all, it seems to me, of trust and unity. The towers collapse at times, and one image online shows the aftermath. The camera looks down from above at a man lying on his back surrounded by team-mates. The beautifully composed image evokes El Greco. A plea arrived by email in my office. The writer, who seemed close to the event, said the man had been unconscious. The message was ambiguous about whether he had later died. It respectfully requested that the image be deleted in recognition of grief, privacy and “the integrity of the injured person”.Depictions of distressed, seriously injured or dead persons need to be handled with care. The editors checked with the suppliers of the images and learned that the man had regained consciousness and was recovering from a shoulder injury.I agree with the editors’ decision to keep the image online. It is one part of a public cultural event in which danger and injury are elements of a truthful account. The reader took the explanation in good heart.Reasonable people can differ on these kinds of calls, but in my time in this role I have been consistently impressed by the willingness of  editors to consider, reconsider and explain their decisions.• Paul Chadwick is the ’s readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32f1fac441d768d3fef2caa1f9a13560a8434f3d/0_180_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d93b2483c2adc0de74a0729aa163caf","title":"we can rebuild economy foundations up","story":"The late Prof Mick Moran, who taught politics and government at Manchester University for most of his professional life, had, according to his colleagues, once had “a certain residual respect for our governing elites”. That all changed during the 2008 financial crisis, after which he experienced an epiphany “because it convinced him that the officer class in business and in politics did not know what it was doing”.After his epiphany, Moran formed a collective of academics dedicated to exposing the complacency of finance-worship and to replacing it with an idea of running modern economies focused on maximising social good. They called themselves the Foundational Economy Collective, based on the idea that it’s in the everyday economy where there is most potential for true social regeneration: not top-down cash-splashing, but renewal and replenishment from the ground upwards.Foundational activities are the materials and services without which we cannot live a civilised life: clean, unrationed water affordable electricity and gas without cuts to supply collective transport on smooth roads and rails quality health and social care provided free at the point of use and reliable, sustainable food supply. Then there’s the “overlooked economy” – everyday services such as hairdressing, veterinary care, catering and hospitality and small-scale manufacturing – which employ far more people, across a wider geographical range, than the “high-skill, hi-tech” economy with which recent governments have been obsessed.For the Foundational Economy authors, focusing on the fundamental value of invisible and unglamorous jobs “restores the importance of unappreciated and unacknowledged tacit skills of many citizens”. It’s a way of looking at economics from the point of view of people rather than figures, and doing something revolutionary (yet so blindingly obvious) in the process. What is the point of “growth” if the basic elements of a decent life are denied to a large and growing number?Because everybody has these everyday needs, their provision is not – or ought not to be – specific to one or a few regions, and is comparatively resistant to automation. If applied by government as a central plank of industrial strategy, prioritising the foundational economy could fundamentally transform people’s quality of life outside London and the south-east – which would be the direct opposite of the dire “northern powerhouse” template that has only created even more cynicism.Visions of an economy run for social good, rather than inidual gain, are being developed by Labour through a series of regional workshops on the “new economics”. As the examples of Preston, Enfield and Oldham councils have shown, it hurts nobody to bring services back into local authority control and to est from the outsourcing firms whose own definition of “growth”’ is extracting profit from social misery.A change in thinking is urgently required to bring about a permanent and ongoing renewal of the foundations of a good society.This brings to mind a long-buried yet prescient quote by Raymond Williams. In his 1960 novel Border Country, he describes a character witnessing “a slow and shocking cancellation of the future” in the wake of the 1926 general strike. This quote has been leapt upon in recent years by a reinvigorated and youthful left.It’s as though, nearly 60 years later, we’ve woken up to the idea that a better future can be reinstated, but that we have to get it back ourselves. Restoring decent basic services for everyone, then keeping the bar high for everyone, is a task akin to painting and repainting the Forth Bridge, and this alone is enough to keep millions of people in stable, valuable work.For a future better than the one we’re dreading, we need to start rebuilding the foundations now. • Lynsey Hanley is a freelance writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6259393982d84513f59f439c232fc01a8b376128/0_0_620_224/master/620.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6ba98d70511714e6fa3bb80c768c2441 1880w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of yellow","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘yellow’The closing date is Wednesday 17 October September at 10am.

It said the controversial ingredient had already been taken out of half of its own-label range, with the rest to be reformulated by the end of 2018.Palm oil – a cheap and mass-produced ingredient renowned for its versatility – is currently found in more than half of all supermarket products, from bread, pastry, biscuits, cereal and chocolate to soap and detergent.But only a small percentage of palm oil comes from an officially approved sustainable source.

It ought to do well there, as its thrilling set-pieces, strong performances, dramatic score and sweeping emotions achieve escape velocity from typical biopic trappings.You’d think a movie like First Man wouldn’t have too many surprises most people know that Apollo 11 landed on the moon and safely returned. (Some, like my late grandmother, think it was a hoax, but there’s not much that can be done about that.) Yet there’s a lot to rummage through in all this lunar dust. Chazelle and company make a lot of unusual choices. One of those choices got a little blown out of proportion into a quasi-controversy when “alt-right” bozos such as renowned troglodyte Dinesh D’Souza, repeated the bad faith argument that First Man didn’t show the US flag. It’s complete poppycock (I saw the movie I saw the flag) but it is true that there is no typical, shot-from-below moment of a flagpole penetrating the alien soil in Michael Bay-esque slow motion. It’s just there, in the background.There is, of course, a reason for this. Chazelle is a sincere film-maker, and he’s telling a story. When we are finally on the moon with Armstrong (in glorious Imax, if you have the bread for the upgraded ticket) we are with him dramatically, and his head (at least in Chazelle’s version) is back on Earth, thinking about his emotional failures and loss.Unlike Apollo 13 or The Right Stuff, First Man is very much focused on one inidual: Ryan Gosling’s interpretation of Neil Armstrong. Interpretation is a key word because Armstrong was notoriously tight-lipped and avoided the spotlight. His guarded nature is no mere character shading, it is a significant plot point.Armstrong is the right man to be the First Man because he is driven, and this film suggests that his laser focus on excellence is all a way to avoid dealing with the death of his two-year-old daughter. We see him hiding his tears and avoiding his wife (Claire Foy) and fellow astro-pals whenever they try to broach this topic. It’s plausible! But it is conjecture.Armstrong rejected the advances of official biographers for years (including James A Michener and Stephen Ambrose) before allowing, in 2002, James R Hansen the right to tell a straightforward version of his story. That book, First Man: The Life of Neil A Armstrong, is what Chazelle and screenwriter Josh Singer adapted into this film and, from a legal perspective, the film-makers can use it as a launchpad for artistic licence (within reason) and still say it is based on the official biography.Nowhere does Hansen suggest that Armstrong was haunted by visions of his late daughter. And, considering how every milligram brought aboard was scrutinised by Nasa (thanks to a prank on Gemini 3 involving a corned beef sandwich) the probability that Armstrong tossed his little girl’s bracelet into a crater is next-to-nil, and leading space historian Michael Neufeld at the Smithsonian Institute agrees with me.The punchline is this: Armstrong was all business, or at least that’s how he liked to present himself. Maybe he did sob on the lunar surface, like Ryan Gosling does. But it’s fair to say that Armstrong would have hated this movie.So was Buzz Aldrin, the Second Man, really such a jerk? All signs point to … possibly. He certainly had a big personality. He and Armstrong were very different in that regard. Armstrong was the level-headed technician, Aldrin had engineering and astronautics degrees. He certainly had a looser tongue and let it be known that he wished he had stepped out first, not Armstrong.But First Man makes some interesting omissions. During a pause between touching down and exiting the lunar module, Aldrin, who was an elder in the Presbyterian Church, silently took communion. A moment of solemnity like that doesn’t really fit Corey Stoll’s performance. What does is what famously happened in 2002, when a conspiracy jackass named Bart Sibrel repeatedly got in Aldrin’s face accusing Apollo 11 of being a hoax. Aldrin socked him in the jaw and I think even the most avowed pacifists would say this guy had it coming.First Man is definitely a pro-space exploration film, even if it does show its dangers. (Three Apollo astronauts died before they even left Earth.) But not everyone at the time (or now, for that matter) felt we should be concerned with “up there” till we fix “down here.” Among them, poet-singer-activist Gil Scott-Heron, best known for the track The Revolution Will Not Be Televised. His first album, Small Talk at 125th and Lenox featured a live recording of a darkly satirical proto-rap entitled Whitey on the Moon. Backed only by percussion, Scott-Heron makes a strong argument for the plight of the poor while gobs of cash were fired into space by white politicians.A montage sequence late in First Man, when the programme looks to be spiralling out of control, includes protesters (and footage of an unimpressed Kurt Vonnegut!) set to Leon Bridges covering the tune.Chazelle’s last film, La La Land, has numerous graceful and well-choreographed musical sequences. First Man changes things up with brain-rattling moments of interplanetary peril. Faces are shown in closeup, the camera quaking to the point of making abstract expressionist images out of the usually dreamy Ryan Gosling. Trouble comes three times in the film, aboard an X-15 rocket plane, on Gemini 8 and when Apollo 11’s lunar module (the Eagle) is moments from landing.The first two sequences get their exposition. But in the heat of the big finish Chazelle decides to just let audiences stay confused. (One can rationalise this: it took a while until Armstrong and the others found out what almost botched the landing.) But here’s what that weird “1202 error” was all about: basically, the late-60s-era computer just had too much data flying in its face.There are some very detailed explanations that get more specific, but in layman’s terms there were two different types of radar-like sensors that, under normal circumstances, could compensate if they were not in phase with one another. But at this moment, with the early computers (which were incredibly advanced for their time) doing so many other things, it couldn’t also “focus” on the equipment that was out of phase. So it just freaked out. Nowadays we just see a spinning wheel on our monitors and know it’s going to be OK. Back then, in the boundless vacuum of space with all of humanity watching, it could cause a little more stress.But at that moment, with the amazing Justin Hurwitz score blasting behind glorious extraterrestrial imagery, is anyone interested in an IT lecture?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa5f99d0b39ab112e3d063d00b9e7b1816fb4947/742_168_2657_1595/master/2657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b475fa2ec9e77e489fb079dcfa5da69","title":"venom new greatest showman tom hardy","story":"Critics mostly hated the ‘poisonously dull’ superhero movie – but it’s a monstrous worldwide hit with cinema-goersIt is a truth universally acknowledged that a cinema-goer in search of a bad movie at the multiplex today must be in want of Venom. Tom Hardy’s unhinged superhero tale – based on a Spider-Man villain, but lacking even a passing reference to the now Marvel-owned web-slinger – is being showered in the viscous black goo of negative critical reviews. Chris Hewitt on The Empire Podcast declared it could set comic-book movies back 10 years and this publication’s Peter Bradshaw said it was “riddled with the poison of dullness”.And yet, people are going to see Venom. Its global box office opening weekend of $205m has doubled its $100m production budget and the mammoth $80.3m domestic bow smashed the $55m record for an October opening previously held by Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-winning Gravity. It topped the box office again in its second week and is already within touching distance of the global box office total of Solo: A Star Wars Story.This void between critical and commercial response will be familiar to anyone who followed the fortunes of The Greatest Showman – Hugh Jackman’s all-singing, all-dancing, all-glitter musical biopic of circus impresario PT Barnum. That movie was dismissed by critics as a colourful failure, but that didn’t prevent it from becoming an all-out global phenomenon. It made $430m worldwide and was still playing on cinema screens in its sing-along incarnation until early May, several weeks after it was available to buy on Blu-ray and DVD and months after the behemoth of Star Wars: The Last Jedi made the hyperspace jump out of multiplexes. Its soundtrack also high-kicked into the record books, spending the most weeks at No 1 of any release on the UK album chart for 50 years.Numbers aside, Venom and The Greatest Showman have a great deal in common. They’re both defiantly silly movies arriving in the wake of heavier, more serious counterparts. Showman’s twee sensibility and embrace of glitter-ball camp felt like a response to the bleakly real rise-and-fall relationship dynamic of La La Land, which had been a critical and commercial smash less than a year previously. With its toe-tapping musical numbers and convenient airbrushing of any material that could have been contentious or difficult, The Greatest Showman was like a breath of sugar-scented fresh air for movie fans over the festive period.Venom, similarly, is the latest superhero film to step tentatively into the goliath shadow created by Avengers: Infinity War – a movie that ends with an act of finger-snapping, universe-ning genocide. After that level of heft, audiences can be forgiven for wanting to watch Hardy do not one, but two funny voices and bite the heads off villains’ shoulders as if they’re jelly babies.Much like The Greatest Showman, Venom appears to have been punished for its refusal to meet audience expectations. Prior to the release of Showman, the movie was being talked about as a potential awards contender in the La La Land mould, with Jackman expected to be a major player in the best-actor race and many assuming the best original song Oscar – a gong that was ultimately handed to Pixar’s Coco – was in the bag. The finished film was emphatically not an awards season beast, playing noisily to the cheap seats rather than the rarefied front row.Venom, similarly, was initially promised to comic-book devotees as a violent antidote to the homogeneity of many superhero adventures. Many of those edges, however, were smoothed off in order to net that lucrative teen-friendly PG-13 rating in America, though the movie’s occasionally shocking violence was enough to get it a 15 certificate in the UK. Fans of the violent, edgy 90s comic-book incarnation of the character were never likely to warm to Hardy’s goofy antihero, who talks the violent talk, but seldom follows through with the claret-soaked brio of a Logan or a Deadpool.Those unburdened by these expectations for Venom, though, were seemingly impressed by the movie’s defiant desire to go its own way. In an era in which even the best superhero movies feel as if they are at least cut from the same comic-book cloth, Venom is the partygoer who arrives in a clown outfit when the dress code is black tie.It’s not likely that Venom will infect popular culture in the same way that The Greatest Showman has bled into every inspiring TV musical montage and holiday-camp cabaret act, but the two movies provide a valuable lesson in terms of the value of silliness in cinema. When the world outside is tearing itself apart environmentally and politically, sometimes a hilariously committed Tom Hardy blabbering on about “turds in the wind” while bathed in inky black pixels is exactly what the doctor ordered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/623239e7183dd0cbd2957439fed20c7406a64d99/0_860_8054_4833/master/8054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b938fa2737c3479e95ccdba6045ecbc2","title":"rachel roddy marinated courgettes with mint and garlic recipe rachel roddy","story":"A rummage among dusty charity-shop bookshelves unearths a gem of a recipe for spicy-sour courgette suffused with the fresh taste of mintFor the past 10 years, some of my best cookbook purchases have been from Oxfam on London’s Marylebone High Street and the Mercatino dell’Usato in Monteverde in Rome. I visit both as often as possible, always feeling the same high on book-buying endorphins as I make a beeline for the cookery shelves.Oxfam is relatively small: you have only to walk a few steps, passing mostly women’s coats and Fairtrade chocolate, to get from the front door to the cookbook section. It’s harder at the Mercatino, which is a warehouse a tetris of antiques and junk, 80-piece crockery sets, novelty ashtrays, designer furniture and old electric guitars. My cookbook endorphin, though, is stronger than the one for Apulian plates and mannequins, even though I am sure a mannequin would come in useful. Will the shelves be exactly the same as the last time, or will there be new arrivals? Has that first edition of A Feast of Floyd been bought? Has someone recently donated a recently passed relative’s entire cookery book collection?After a period in which the shelves in both places stayed more or less the same, a fresh batch of books arrived in both places – at least two dozen in each, the nature of which suggested someone had either downsized or died. While new books smell crisp and inky, secondhand books smell like old wardrobes and vanilla, and come with a history: the immediately obvious one, a name inscribed inside the cover, scribbles in the margin or a fringe of Post-it notes but also the clues that make you feel like a detective – the folds and creases, a smudge of sauce or oily print. Patricia Wells’ Bistro Cooking (one of a five-book haul from Oxfam) belonged to Siobhan in 1993: there are Post-its marking bagna cauda, tartelettes aux pommes and mon gateau au chocolat which, according to the margin notes, is “v good”, “needs 35 mins” and to “see Gary Rhodes page 233”. The mark in a €1 copy of La Cucina Napoletana by Jeanne Caròla Francesconi is both less and more obvious – it simply fell open on page 196, at a recipe for zucchine a “scapece”.Alla scapece, like saor in Venice and carpione in the north of Italy, is a technique of cooking fish or vegetables by first frying and then covering them in a marinade of vinegar, aromatics and herbs. The origin of the word is Spanish – escabeche – a reminder of the Spanish influence in Italian cooking, and dishes cooked alla scapece are often typical of port towns in which this influence first arrived with hungry merchant sailors.The zucchine a scapece of Naples is pretty much the recipe I learned in Rome. Like the stuffed courgettes I wrote about a couple of weeks ago, the mint is vital, like a breath of fresh air up against the soft, oily courgette, vinegar rasp and heat of the chilli. With bread, salami, olives and cheese, zucchine a scapece are one of the greatest antipasti, but also excellent with fish or stuffed into a sandwich. The book suggests a 24-hour wait, but a few hours will do, and I have noted that in the margin of my copy.1kg courgettesOil, for frying (olive or vegetable)1 handful mint or mentuccia150ml red wine vinegar150ml water2 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced1 small, dried red chilli, crumbledSlice the courgettes into rounds roughly 3mm thick. If you have time, spread them on a clean cloth and leave them to sit – ideally in the sun, otherwise any dry place – for an hour, turning after 30 minutes.In a medium frying pan, heat a couple of thumbs of oil and then, working in batches, fry the rounds until lightly golden. Using a slotted spoon, lift the courgettes on to a kitchen towel to blot.When drained, layer the courgettes in a bowl, sprinkling salt and tucking ripped mint between each layer and in the gaps.In a small pan, bring the vinegar, water, garlic and chilli to the boil, and continue to boil for five minutes.Pour the vinegar mixture over the courgettes, along with three tablespoons of olive oil, either from the frying pan or the bottle. Toss the courgettes, cover, and leave to sit for at least an hour – ideally 24 hours.

Mix the garlic, chilli, balsamic vinegar and olive oil in a jar.Top, tail and peel the onions, and cut each into eight wedges. Put into a large bowl with the tomatoes and toss the lot in the balsamic mix. Spread over two large baking trays, season generously with salt and pepper, then roast for about half an hour, until the vegetables are looking caramelised and delicious.Meanwhile, bring a pan of salted water to the boil and cook the farro for 20-30 minutes, (cooking times vary according to brand) until tender and plumped up. Drain and rinse under cold water to cool, then transfer to a salad bowl or platter.Once the squash and tomatoes are out of the oven and cooling, spread the hazelnuts out on a baking tray and pop in the oven for four to five minutes until just golden, then remove and leave to leaveset aside to cool.Next, make the basil oil. In a pestle and mortar or a small food processor, crush the garlic with a big pinch of salt, then start adding the basil leaves, either bashing or whizzing them until fine. Stir in the vinegar, then add the oil in a steady stream until you have a bright green dressing. Season, then stir two-thirds of the dressing through the farro, keeping the rest to drizzle over later.Gently fold the squash and onion through the farro, then lightly crush the hazelnuts and sprinkle them over. Shave the cheese over everything, add a little extra dressing, if you want, then serve.If you want to save the planet with what you eat, look for Hodmedods online – a brilliant producer of British-grown grains and pulses, which would work brilliantly in this recipe.

The Chelsea defender’s previous loan, at Sunderland last season, was overshadowed by back-to-back dismissals and now another red card – and a harsh one, too – was about to be shown in his direction. Holding his head in his hands, Clarke-Salter had only one thought: “Not again.”Pulling up a chair at St George’s Park ahead of England Under-21s’ game against Scotland on Tuesday, Clarke-Salter talks about “a massive learning curve” as he reflects on those red cards and his loan experiences, starting two years ago at Bristol Rovers, where he ended up having a metal plate inserted in an arm after a painful fracture-dislocation of his elbow.At times it has been a test of his character as much as anything, especially at Sunderland, where Clarke-Salter had been so keen to have a positive impact only for everything to unravel. “It was tough, I was 20 years old and obviously I had to deal with the responsibility because they were my mistakes,” he says. “The first sending-off was a derby game and I made a badly timed tackle. The second one was just a bit of inexperience on my side. I’d just come back into the team, so I was gutted. But I’ve learned from it.”Although his dismissal against Basel was controversial and hard to accept – Clarke-Salter clearly make contact with the ball first – he could be forgiven for worrying about picking up a reputation for seeing red. “You say that but then Sergio Ramos has had 20-something red cards in his career and he’s one of the best centre-backs ever, so it happens,” Clarke-Salter replies. “It might be the last red card in my career. It might not be. But you live and learn.”It is easy to overlook the leap from academy to senior football, even for those who have enjoyed spectacular success at youth level – and Clarke-Salter falls into that category. He was a member of the England squad that triumphed at the Under-20 World Cup last year, part of the Chelsea team that lifted two Uefa Youth League titles and is among a select group of teenagers to have won three FA Youth Cups. Yet first-team level presents a fresh set of challenges. “It’s a lot different to academy football,” Clarke-Salter says. “Every point matters. But fighting for those points in front of fans is the best feeling ever.”Although Chelsea’s close ties with Vitesse will naturally lead some to assume that Clarke-Salter had little say in joining the Dutch club this summer, the 21-year-old insists it was “completely my choice”. He met Steven Gerrard, the Rangers manager, at the Toulon tournament in the summer with a view to going to Ibrox and several Championship clubs were interested, but Clarke-Salter liked the thought of playing in the Ereisie, where Mason Mount excelled on loan from Chelsea last season.“A lot of young English players at the moment have gone abroad,” says Clarke-Salter, who has started every league fixture for Vitesse and is playing with more and more confidence. “I think it’s the regular game-time that is important to us. That’s the main thing – playing games can open up so many opportunities. Mason is an example of that. He didn’t play much for the first couple of months at Vitesse, then all of a sudden he ripped the league apart.”Listening to Clarke-Salter it is clear that he has had to grow up fast on and off the pitch. He is one of six children – the youngest is 10 – and his responsibilities extend beyond being an older sibling. “My mum and dad separated when I was about 11. So I’ve been a father figure for my little brothers and sisters, and tried to be like a role model for them, supporting them and hopefully giving them a better childhood,” Clarke-Salter explains. “I’m trying to be a positive influence on them that’s one of my aims really, to be there for them.”Succeeding at Chelsea has focused his mind in that respect. He joined the club he grew up supporting when he was nine and his determination to make the grade shone through from an early age. Academy staff at Chelsea still smile at the way Clarke-Salter would knock their door again and again. “I just always wanted to try and improve,” he says. “So I was asking questions, like: ‘How can I do better?’ I never wanted to waste a training session. I always wanted to try to be at the top and progress with the older age groups, like some other players were doing.”Thoughts of playing again for Chelsea can wait. At the moment it is all about getting a full season behind him at Vitesse, who are fifth in the Ereisie, retaining his place in Aidy Boothroyd’s England Under-21 squad, which is something that means so much to him, and taking the positives from a couple of tricky experiences. “I feel like I’ve learned to be a man,” Clarke-Salter says, “and I think that’s helping me now, because I’m confident and playing well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd3743cfa67341a8066d5f37d38711d0853a8219/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8264defb5006bae0792876cfb37218aa","title":"womens super league talking points from the weekends action","story":"Arsenal look unstoppable, Chelsea are missing Chapman, miserly Birmingham win again and Yeovil are improvingThe way Arsenal are brushing teams aside this season is reminiscent of their glory days. They have won every match, most of them with ease – their four league games include two 5-0 wins and a 7-0, and this week it was the reigning champions on the receiving end. The major difference this season is how clinical they have been in front of goal, with Vivianne Miedema, who has six goals and four assists already and scored another two at Chelsea, seeming unstoppable. Their best play comes down the middle, with Miedema combining with Kim Little and Jordan Nobbs to cut through their opponents. They only had 11 shots on Sunday, and seven on target, but five of those went in. They are getting the rub of the green in some situations – their third goal was a cross from Nobbs that flew straight in – but that kind of clinical chance conversion demonstrates the confidence bubbling through the team at the moment.If Chelsea wanted to know what their vulnerabilities were, they were laid bare by Arsenal. Last season they were reliant on being offensively dominant, which helped to make up for some defensive vulnerabilities. This season the attack isn’t clicking and not a lot has changed defensively. They actually had more shots than Arsenal, and five on target. Last season, when it was all very fluid, front-foot stuff, they would have converted a few of those, but the confidence has dried up. What is becoming increasingly apparent is that they miss the retired Katie Chapman massively, someone who could drag her team through games, pull them out of situations where they were spiralling towards defeat, someone who would literally do anything, put her body anywhere, to help her team. This season the captain’s armband has been handed around: Karen Carney and Hedvig Lindahl have led the team but both were on the bench this weekend, when Millie Bright got the honour. She’s a good organiser, but that’s a massive responsibility for a relatively young centre-half. The way the captaincy is being handed around suggests that the team is maybe lacking a clear leader.• Chelsea v Arsenal: as it happenedMarc Skinner’s side may not be free-scoring, but the results they are getting this season are remarkable. For the fourth time in five games they won 1-0, to remain level on points with Arsenal. They lost a few players in the off-season – Jess Carter went to Chelsea, and might be regretting that decision now – but Skinner has created a very hard-working, very organised, very disciplined team, and it’s great to see a young manager come in and have such an effect. Bristol City put numbers behind the ball and tried to shut them out, but despite missing a penalty Birmingham eventually came good. It must feel so great to think before the game, ‘Come on, try to beat us.’ Everyone must know their role so well, and as a team that must feel really powerful. Bristol didn’t have a single shot or win a single corner: Birmingham are just so rigid and organised, their defence is extremely hard to breach. There has been a big change since last season and though they have some excellent players – Meaghan Sargeant is emerging as a strong leader and an extremely good young centre-half – Skinner deserves most of the credit.• From Roebuck to Salmon: 10 young English footballers to watchI remember going on a tour of Japan with Caroline Weir when she was 16 years old, and her quality was obvious even then. She was very young when she came through at Arsenal, then moved to Liverpool to play more first-team football, but since switching to Manchester City this summer her game has gone up a level. She seems now to be feeling the freedom to express herself as a footballer. She’s a craftsman, a set-piece specialist, someone with an eye for a pass and the ability to thread balls through. City beat West Ham 7-1 and Weir opened the scoring in the second minute and got a couple of assists. Put simply, if she has a good season then City will have a good season. After a disappointing start they have certainly got their mojo back, and perhaps it has also helped them that the likes of Nikita Parris and Steph Houghton have flourished on international duty and successfully brought that form back with them. With Chelsea at the moment it looks like players are drained when they come back from internationals, but City are proving that you can use those breaks to your benefit.Last season Yeovil lost their first 12 league games without scoring a goal. In 10 league matches since then, across last season and this, they have got a couple of draws and scored four times. The table still doesn’t look very encouraging – after four games they have no points and a goal difference of -13 – but there is improvement there, there is progress. Lee Burch was appointed manager in the summer, and that is a heck of a job. Footballers want to win, whatever team they’re playing for, and Burch has to manage that disappointment, to somehow sustain morale, to take positives from games like Sunday’s 2-1 defeat at Liverpool and have them go into their next match feeling they could get something. They could have nicked a point on Sunday – it took an 87th-minute goal from Jess Clarke for Liverpool, with Chris Kirkland still in caretaker charge, to beat them – and this team hasn’t been in that position very often. Yeovil have had to make some huge changes to become a full-time professional team, and the amount of progress they have made in a short space of time has to be commended. Having scored in their first four games as many goals as they did in the whole of last season, they don’t look all that far away from getting a positive result to back that up.• From ‘party girl’ to the Belgian top flight: Emma Coolen’s remarkable riseBT Sport has coverage of the FA Women’s Super League all season.

We found that girls experience more of the risks but fewer, if any of the benefits without the time or permission to develop the confidence to explore more sophisticated uses of mobile, girls’ tech literacy is hampered.”The researchers trained teenage ambassadors to interview 1,400 15- to 19-year-olds in Nigeria, Tanzania, Malawi, Rwanda, India and Bangladesh. Though smartphones are commonplace across each of the six countries, it was found that girls face disproportionate barriers to accessing technology, diminishing their digital literacy.Bertermann said that girls who resorted to secretive phone use felt unable to tell parents or friends about safety issues arising from their use of social media. The study identified male harassment as their foremost concern.The researchers found marked differences in the way boys and girls used mobile technology. In Nigeria and Malawi, for instance, boys tended to use phones for a more sophisticated range of activities, from spending time on social media and searching the internet for news to finding jobs. Girls in these locations were more likely to be restricted to simple tasks like calling their parents or using the calculator.In India and Bangladesh, girls with mobile phones face stigma within their communities. Those breaking rules imposed on their usage reported punishments including severe beatings, being kept out of school or even early marriage.In Malawi and Rwanda, where access to mobile is restricted and tech literacy among girls is low, girls expressed fears that a phone might lead to unwanted pregnancy by making it easier to contact boys. However, an overwhelmingly majority also felt that a phone could help to keep them safe.Girl Effect, which is aiming to improve digital literacy and online safety among girls, said the results would help them to provide targeted services to the estimated 7 million girls using borrowed phones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a7399fe61b974f76baab6dd66dd2bdbea41b099/0_61_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6e9f55f4cb0e2b07c401fe0bb78853d","title":"yemen on brink worst famine 100 years un","story":"UN warns that famine could overwhelm country in next three months, with 13 million people at risk of starvation Yemen could be facing the worst famine in 100 years if airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition are not halted, the UN has warned.If war continues, famine could engulf the country in the next three months, with 12 to 13 million civilians at risk of starvation, according to Lise Grande, the agency’s humanitarian coordinator for Yemen.She told the BBC: “I think many of us felt as we went into the 21st century that it was unthinkable that we could see a famine like we saw in Ethiopia, that we saw in Bengal, that we saw in parts of the Soviet Union – that was just unacceptable.“Many of us had the confidence that would never happen again and yet the reality is that in Yemen that is precisely what we are looking at.”Yemen has been in the grip of a bloody civil war for three years after Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, seized much of the country, including the capital, Sana’a. The Saudi-led coalition has been fighting the rebels since 2015 in support of the internationally recognised government.Thousands of civilians have been caught in the middle, trapped by minefields and barrages of mortars and airstrikes. The resulting humanitarian catastrophe has seen at least 10,000 people killed and millions displaced.Speaking on Sunday evening, Grande said: “There’s no question we should be ashamed, and we should, every day that we wake up, renew our commitment to do everything possible to help the people that are suffering and end the conflict.”Her comments came after the UN and humanitarian workers condemned an airstrike in which the Saudi-led coalition targeted Yemen’s Shia rebels, killing at least 15 people near the port city of Hodeidah.Video footage released by the rebels showed the remains of a mangled minibus littered with groceries following the attack on Saturday, which left 20 others injured.The Houthi rebels reported that five members of the same family were among those killed, adding that many children were among the casualties. “The United Nations agencies working in Yemen unequivocally condemn the attack on civilians and extend our deepest condolences to the families of the victims,” said Grande.She added: “Under international humanitarian law, parties to the conflict are obliged to respect the principles of precaution, proportionality and distinction. Belligerents must do everything possible to protect civilians not hurt, maim, injure or kill them.”Hodeidah, with its key port installations that bring in UN and other humanitarian aid, has become the centre of Yemen’s conflict, with ground troops allied to the coalition struggling to drive out the rebels controlling it.The killing and maiming of civilians including many children in the Red Sea city of has soared in the last three months according to aid workers.Since June more than 170 people have been killed and at least 1,700 have been injured Hodeidah province, with more than 425,000 people forced to flee their homes.A Gulf coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has been trying to wrestle back control of the strategic port city.If the array of Yemeni militias takes the city it would be their biggest victory against the rebels, although the battle on the Red Sea coast also threatens to throw Yemen into outright famine.Last month Save the Children warned the fighting was turning into a “war on children” with thousands suffering life-changing injuries in the attacks.On a visit to Yemen the charity’s CEO, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, warned attacks on schools and hospitals were on the rise, with children on the frontline of violence and medics unable to cope with the influx of the wounded.Meanwhile the country’s currency has collapsed and food prices have doubled in the last month, fuelling the threat of famine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d298f34e3769fe173aa4080841a9d33241b6b97/597_742_5163_3098/master/5163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5238b84cecc20af1547c44ff3397bcfa","title":"get management to listen sharmadean reid","story":"Set aside idealistic notions in favour of commercial viability, says Sharmadean ReidI’m new at an established company with a set way of doing things.

Is it a response to our troubled times – or inidual expressionism?Outside, Tania James’s home looks fairly average, a flat in a Victorian conversion on a north London street lined with trees and speed bumps. Inside, it’s a riot of colour.Neon pink, yellow and orange zap across the walls, while dozens of 60s and 70s tea trays line the stairs, each a different pattern. In the living room are green and pink sofas with leopard-print cushions. A pink plastic light-up pigeon and a toy plastic horse sit on a shelf alongside a big yellow plastic bird she found in a charity shop. “I was like, oh my God, £4 – that’ll go with the pigeon!” she says. On another shelf sits her brightly coloured glass-bottle collection, which she has been adding to for the past 20 years – “it’s a one-in, one–out policy now”. There is a fireplace painted highlighter yellow, pink and purple, with a baby-sized blue plastic bear standing to attention in the grate. In the bay window, a jungle of house plants spreads its fronds. “I don’t want to say I’m attached to stuff,” says James. “I’m not materialistic – but it’s important to me to have how I feel inside, out.”She understands that the home she shares with her family is “Marmite” – someone once told her: “It’s like 10 cups of coffee with a migraine.” But she loves it. “I work from home and I literally need it,” she says. And while it may sound chaotic, on a sunny Monday morning it feels surprisingly serene.In 2018, James’s maximalism has found its moment. After decades in which the idea of a stylish home tended towards a minimalist aesthetic of pale walls and bare wood, the past few years have seen a decisive turn, with everywhere from Gucci to John Lewis to River Island bringing out flamboyant homeware ranges. Ikea once urged people to “chuck out your chintz”, but last month it launched an accessories collection by artist Per B Sundberg, who describes his work as “lush, rough and burlesque” it includes skull-shaped vases and candlesticks in the shape of poodles.On Instagram, maximalist interiors abound. James is known as Ms Pink on the site (she and her partner run a company called Quirk and Rescue, selling cushions and prints) and she points out the democratic nature of social media you would have had to buy specialist magazines in the past to access anything approaching this range of ideas. But the move towards maximalism also seems to be about other shifts: a reaction to grim political times, and a rejection of the idea of a house as, primarily, a commodity.In the 00s, as house prices rose swiftly, cultural forces, including TV property shows, encouraged home-owners to keep their house beige and bland, the idea being that this would increase its appeal should they ever need to sell or let it. Now there seems to be a move towards making our living space – big or small, rented or owned – into an expression of our personality. In other words, a home.Maximalism can be read as an escape from a world and culture that at times seems bleak. James sees it in part as a backlash against austerity: “People are like, right, what can we do to make ourselves feel good?” The American interior designer Jonathan Adler suggests it’s because “minimalism is a bummer. When you’re about to kick the bucket, you don’t want to look back and see an endless haze of beige.” He says maximalism is about surrounding yourself with things that make you “feel a little bit more glamorous than you think you are”. Rather than more-is-more, he describes this as “glamour-upon-glamour”.Pati Robins, a full-time carer whose maximalist rented home on the outskirts of Cardiff has attracted more than 50,000 Instagram followers, says maximalism for her is about “a collection of things that I love … I have to feel something for them. If something gives me a great joy or any reaction, I pick it up.” When she and her husband first started renting their home from a housing association in 2006, she says it was a nicotine-stained, “magnolia hell, all Scandi and Ikea, all white and empty”. She had moved from Poland with one suitcase and her husband “was a homeless veteran, so he didn’t have many belongings. When you live like someone else is living because you don’t want to stick out too much,” she says, “you end up feeling like a guest in your own home … it was just awful.”Tomris Tangaz, course director in interior design at Chelsea College of Art, says that during eras when “things get tough, people find ways of negotiating those climates and I think private spaces in particular – your four walls – are the only spaces that are not loaded, that are free of authority and rules”. (There are, of course, often a lot of rules that come with renting a property, which can impinge on tenants’ ability to express themselves, so it’s interesting to see how Robins and many other people on Instagram are finding ways to negotiate that.)Tangaz says there is a sense that our homes represent a rest from the world outside, and while Robins doesn’t want to ascribe too much of her home’s decor to turbulent political times – “I didn’t start maximalism after Brexit,” she says – she does think of it as her “own personal sanctuary. I close the door and I escape the world.” It’s a feeling she says her husband, who suffers from mental health problems, shares. When the house was still empty, “he felt more on edge … it reminded him of hospitals”. Now it is filled with their objects, “he’s a bit calmer”, she says.Her version of the aesthetic feels very different from James’s – her walls are painted dark colours, for instance. In her living room, the head of a donkey juts from a neon pink frame.Maximalism is all about expressing iniduality and personality, and so the cultural reference points are hugely varied. Ben Spriggs, executive editor of Elle Decoration magazine, mentions the colour-saturated worlds of Wes Anderson and the Italian palazzo look of Call Me By Your Name. Both he and James namecheck the 1980s Memphis design movement, with its squiggly patterns and bold colours, especially the aesthetic of its founder, Ettore Sottsass, whose fans included David Bowie and Elio Fiorucci – Sottsass co-designed the latter’s flagship New York store.In Luke Edward Hall’s one-bedroom flat, there are shell-shaped wall lamps, merman candlesticks and so many books that his shelves sag under their weight. He is one of the artists and interior designers most associated with today’s maximalism, and says that at a time when the world can be quite grim, it is about escaping into a fantastical universe.For him, that involves being surrounded by objects that have a story. “It is a way of expressing yourself,” he says, sitting on a mustard yellow sofa. “In the same way I have scrapbooks, it’s a way of having these memories surrounding you.” On a nearby table are small glass anchovies picked up on a trip to the Amalfi coast with his partner on another there are glass chicory and asparagus picked up in Venice. He and his partner “love anything shaped like a fish, vegetable or animal”, he says. His fridge is adorned with magnets of crustaceans, Campari and Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus. In the bedroom, there are palm-print bedsheets and a leopard-print carpet, green wallpaper and pink curtains.For James, one of the most appealing aspects of maximalism is its DIY quality – her living room includes fake cheese plant leaves bought for less than £2 from Ikea and spray-painted neon orange and pink, as well as a customised Mothercare clock from when her children were young. This customisation reminds her of the punk scene she was part of in the 70s: “People are realising that you don’t have to be rich and able to employ an interior designer – you can just get stuff you love and make it look good.”With minimalism there was a clear aesthetic, while maximalism embraces everything from Robins’s dark walls, James’s neon birds, and Hall’s shrimp magnets. “It’s much more personal,” says Tangaz, “much more about what you want to create.” Robins believes people are “getting sick and tired of living like everybody else. I think we just want to be seen as iniduals.” If that means pink walls, orange floors and lamps in the shape of artichokes, so be it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24a561cdd8ac4966536b25d61779641d27544a4e/0_158_5807_3484/master/5807.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a04814d1d9e20c5d39606f8246c099c","title":"dobet gnahore review kings place london","story":"Kings Place, LondonThe versatile Ivory Coast singer’s soulful side was overshadowed by her rapid-fire dance routines and a backing band at full tiltBorn in Ivory Coast and now based in France, Dobet Gnahoré is a striking-looking, highly theatrical performer with a style that blends west African influences with western pop and includes anything from ballads to funk and dance tunes. She is also an impressive, energetic dancer and an effective percussionist. But she needs more distinctive settings for her often socially concerned lyrics, and a more sympathetic backing band.She began with Djoli, a pleasant, drifting electro-pop ballad from her recent album Miziki, and it was soon clear she would not be helped by her keyboard player, who added anything from mbira-like effects to thumping bass lines, and a guitarist and drummer who clearly couldn’t wait for their solo spots. Their full-tilt approach may be necessary on the festival circuit, but in this intimate setting it rarely allowed her to show the more delicate, soulful side of her work.As a result, her increasingly rapid-fire dance routines and theatrics were often more interesting than the music. She carried a calabash in a tribute to African women, and threw fake bank notes across the stage before announcing that love is more important than money. She used masks as props in the cool, drifting La Clé, and showed off her drumming skills on Education.The best songs were left until the end, and included the emotional ballad La Source, the final, stomping Miziki, which brought the audience to its feet, and then the encore, Palea, from her second album more than a decade ago.

Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman, said it was almost inevitable the UK would end up with no deal.He told the Belfast Newsletter: “Given the way in which the EU has behaved and the corner they’ve put Theresa May into, there’s no deal which I can see at present which will command a majority in the House of Commons. So it is probably inevitable that we will end up with a no-deal scenario.”EU negotiators had been open to introducing an EU-UK customs union, even on a temporary basis, which could supersede the backstop, in which Northern Ireland stays in the single market and the customs union as the rest of the country withdraws.But diplomats noted that the prime minister had repeatedly committed to a “specific” solution for Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement that would give the Irish Republic the necessary assurance that a hard border could never be introduced with Northern Ireland.May had said in her letter to Tusk, which was demanded in March by the EU as part of an attempt to move the negotiations on, that she was committed to “specific measures in relation to Northern Ireland”, and would work on “a legal text for at least the ‘so-called backstop option’ set out” in December’s joint report, which first introduced the need for Northern Ireland alone to stay in the EU’s structures.Raab had arrived in Brussels on Sunday unexpectedly, ahead of this week’s crunch leaders’ summit at which the EU has demanded “maximum progress” be made to allow the talks to develop.He is understood to have told the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that the volatility of UK politics meant a plan to strike an agreement on Monday on the backstop was not possible.Ambassadors for the EU27 were subsequently told on Sunday night by Sabine Weyand, the bloc’s deputy chief negotiator, that the “Brits need more time”. “The problem is at the British end,” a diplomat said.Speaking on Monday, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, rejected the idea of Labour helping May get a Brexit deal through parliament, saying his party would stick to its long-declared six tests for what constitutes a good Brexit.On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Starmer rejected the idea that if May gave way and she faced opposition in parliament from rebel Conservative MPs and the DUP, Labour should help push though a deal.“At the moment we don’t even know what the proposal is that everybody has fallen out about over the weekend,” he said. “What we’re saying is that’s got to be published and that needs to be looked at and scrutinised by parliament.”“This is politics around the cabinet table that’s holding the country back.”Labour had sought to find a consensual solution beforehand but had been rebuffed, Starmer said: “Every time we have tried to involve parliament, the government said no. So now to come at the end of the exercise and say parliament has got to rubber-stamp whatever comes back, that really isn’t right.”All negotiations between the EU and the UK have been put on hold. The prime minister has been invited to address the EU27 heads of state and government before a dinner on Wednesday night but she has yet to accept.The impasse is set to prompt further calls from May’s Tory critics for her to abandon the entire backstop idea, and her wider Chequers plan.In his regular column for the Daily , the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said the EU was “treating us with naked contempt”. He wrote: “Like some chessplayer triumphantly forking our king and our queen, the EU commission is offering the UK government what appears to be a binary choice. It is a choice between the breakup of this country, or the subjugation of this country, between separation or submission.”But Claire Perry, May’s climate change minister, said Johnson and the former Brexit secretary David Davis, who called over the weekend for ministers to rebel against May, were using “playground language”.Perry told Sky News: “This is the time for incredibly serious grownups to be round the negotiating table, and I am very confident that she will come back with a deal. It might not be this month, we’ve got this timing thing that we’ve put into our heads. But we will get a deal, and she’s the right person to get it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51d9503699f77d1242b7c3ed13e7bd25ffa2f0ac/73_201_3397_2038/master/3397.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b47262c29d6b564882e349c9cfff67c","title":"brexit uk accuses eu of trying to impose backstop to the backstop politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenKatya Adler also says that EU sources are claiming that the UK government blocked discussion of the Irish backstop in the Brexit talks for months because it was too politically sensitive.Katya Adler, the BBC’s Europe editor, says diplomats in Brussels are not too worried about the breakdown in the Brexit talks yesterday.Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, is holding talks with Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg this morning with Brexit high on the agenda.The meeting with Simon Coveney started before 11am and is expected to last around an hour. Coveney, who is also Ireland’s foreign minister, has said that a time limited backstop is a “deal breaker” but is confident that a deal can still be reached to keep the Irish border open and invisible after Brexit through a combination of the withdrawal agreement and political agreement. The Irish government is said to be “calm” about the collapse of talks yesterday.They feel that it was clear last week that it was “impossible” to achieve a deal for the EU council summit and will be pushing heads of state at the meeting on Thursday to “give it one more opportunity” with a full Brexit summit in November.Coveney’s view is that the optimism over last week’s talks was misplaced. In reference to the confidential meetings between officials on both sided last week, sources said that “not everything that happened in the tunnel was bad” and there was no need “throw the baby out with the bathwater”.The French president Emanuel Macron has previously stated that the November meeting should not happen unless enough progress has been made on the Irish border.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has just finished a speech on Brexit at the RSA thinktank in London. My colleague Pippa Crerar has tweeted these from the event.Sturgeon is now taking questions. There is a live feed here.My colleague Peter Walker has tweeted out more excerpts from the Cox report.The House of Commons authorities have this morning published the independent report into the bullying of Commons staff compiled by Dame Laura Cox. You can read it here (pdf). Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot’s story about its findings.Cox did not investigate specific allegations about named iniduals. But her findings are nevertheless quite damning. Here is an extract from Cox’s opening statement.The nature and extent of the allegations of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment, made against other members of House staff as well as against some members of parliament, are disturbing, and the effects of such misconduct have been exacerbated by the inadequate procedures in place to tackle them. Extensive experience in the field of employment law over several decades, involving many 4 different public and private sector employers, marks the House out as a stark reminder of how bad things used to be ...Members of Parliament are elected representatives, but their mandate does not entitle them to bully or harass those who are employed in the House to support and assist them. Amongst current and former staff alike there is an obvious pride and affection for the House and its status. Working there is, for many, a privilege – whether as a member of House staff or as an elected Member of Parliament - and there is an expectation of loyalty to the institution they serve. But that sense of loyalty has been tested to breaking point by a culture, cascading from the top down, of deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence, in which bullying, harassment and sexual harassment have been able to thrive and have long been tolerated and concealed ...Underpinning all the recommendations in this report is the need for broad cultural change in the House and the need to restore the trust and confidence of the staff and of the wider public. Delivering fundamental and permanent change will require a focus and a genuine commitment on the part of the leadership of the House. However, the inescapable conclusion from the views expressed during this inquiry is that it will be extremely difficult to build confidence that there will be fundamental change when the levers of change are regarded as part of the change that is needed. Whoever is ultimately responsible for delivering this change, there has to be, at the outset, an honest and open acknowledgment at senior level of the failings of the past and of the need to rebuild trust and restore the confidence of all those who work for the House. I’m just back from the lobby briefing. And we got some news.I will post a full summary soon.And Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, has also got his weekly column in the  today (paywall). He has used it to restate his opposition to Theresa May’s Brexit plans, but he seems to have escalated his contempt for the EU. He is now accusing them of acting like bullies, and of treating the UK with “naked contempt”. He says:There comes a point when you have to stand up to bullies. After more than two years of being ruthlessly pushed around by the EU, it is time for the UK to resist ...In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt. Like some chess player triumphantly forking our king and our queen, the EU Commission is offering the UK government what appears to be a binary choice. It is a choice between the break-up of this country, or the subjugation of this country, between separation or submission. It is between treating Northern Ireland as an economic colony of the EU, or treating the whole of the UK as such a colony. It is a choice between protecting the Union or saving Brexit. It is a choice between two exquisitely embarrassing varieties of humiliation.He also says it was “completely wrong” for the government to agree to the backstop plan in the joint report published in December. He says:It was completely wrong of the government to agree this so-called Northern Irish “backstop”on December 8 last year, and those of us who had doubts at the time have been more than vindicated. We were told that it was just a form of words we were told that it was merely temporary we were told that these were redundant phrases that would never be invoked. As it is, that Irish backstop has been turned into the means of frustrating Brexit, because the alternative is even worse.The last time he made a similar point Number 10 pointed out that he did not object at the time, when he was serving in the government as foreign secretary.I’m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am.In an article for the Daily  (paywall) Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s leader at Westminster, says the DUP are not bluffing when they say could never accept the Irish backstop plans as currently proposed. He says:One part of the UK cannot be left behind, bound to rules set in Brussels. The constitutional and economic consequences of such an approach would be catastrophic in the long run.The importance of what is decided on the backstop issue cannot be understated. This backstop is going to be legally operational and binding, unlike the political declaration on any future trading relationship. And what is being proposed would bind the UK and Northern Ireland into a trap whereby Northern Ireland remains subject to certain Single Market rules and the UK including Northern Ireland remains in the Custom Union unless and until the EU decides that something better comes along that they can agree with.That is why the issue of a time limit is so important. How can we hand over the decision on our future trading and economic future to the EU ...Let me be clear again - we will not be party to the abandonment of fundamental principles and harm to the Union to be codified forever in a withdrawal agreement. We could not support such a proposition. Bluff? We don’t gamble with the Union.This is from Sky’s Deborah Haynes, who is at the EU foreign affairs council in Luxembourg.On Wednesday I hope that we can see it a bit more clearly.Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, will meet the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar for a private dinner in Dublin this evening, the Press Association says. The PA report goes on:It is understood she will stress a desire for a strong relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to continue post-Brexit.She will tell Varadkar that she wants to see a deal that works for both jurisdictions. It is understood Foster will seek to strike a conciliatory tone with Varadkar after a year that has seen relations between the pair fray over Brexit.On her visit to the Irish capital, Foster will also meet Micheal Martin, the leader of main opposition party Fianna Fail. She also will meet a leading cardiologist to discuss a cross-border heart service that treats children from both sides of the border and visit St Patrick’s Church of Ireland cathedral.Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman, has described a no deal Brexit as “probably inevitable”, the Belfast News Letter reports. Wilson said:Given the way in which the EU has behaved and the corner they’ve put Theresa May into, there’s no deal which I can see at present which will command a majority in the House of Commons.So it is probably inevitable that we will end up with a no deal scenario.I think that anybody looking at it objectively would say that what is on offer from the EU is a far worse deal than a no deal, and therefore she’d be mad to be railroaded into accepting it.As Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, arrived at the meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg (not Brussels, as I wrongly said earlier), he said he thought a deal was still possible. But he also said Theresa May would never agree to a deal incompatible with the EU referendum result. He told reporters:I think everyone in the UK should have confidence that this prime minister, Theresa May, will never sign a deal that is not compatible with the letter and spirit of the referendum result.But we also firmly believe that we can find a deal on that basis that works for the European Union and our partners and friends in Europe.EU foreign ministers are meeting in Luxembourg today. On his arrival Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister, said that the failure to reach an agreement yesterday was “frustrating and disappointing” and that, effectively, UK and EU negotiators were going to put their talks on hold until after this week’s summit. He told reporters. I think we are frustrated, but we are still pretty calm about that. I think everybody would like to have seen clarity this week on the withdrawal agreement. Time is moving on. Ratification mechanisms are going to take time, whether that’s in Westminster or in the European parliament. So I think there was a real effort over the last 10 days by the two negotiating teams to intensify engagement so that they could have a set of recommendations for political leaders this week. That hasn’t proven possible. Yesterday the negotiating teams agreed to disengage, effectively, until after this week’s European council meeting. That is frustrating and disappointing from an Irish perspective, as the country that is more exposed to the fall out of Brexit than any other EU country outside of the UK itself.We want to see an outcome that settles nerves, that allows us to move ahead with a managed, sensible Brexit. I still think it’s possible to do that, but clearly it’s going to take a bit more time than many people had hoped.Coveney also said that the UK had already agreed to an Irish backstop, in the joint report agreed in December. The backstop will be there unless and until something else is agreed. But unless you have something to replace it, well then the backstop needs to be there as an insurance mechanism. That’s all we’re asking for.One of the joys of Brexit as a story is that it is an endless source of new jargon and terminology. And this morning we have a new addition to the collection: “backstop to the backstop”.This is the phrase that UK government sources have been using to describe what they say the EU is trying to impose on them. This is from the Press Association.The Brexit talks have run into a “significant problem” over the fraught issue of the Northern Ireland border, government sources have said.Negotiations are on a knife-edge after a hastily-arranged meeting on Sunday between EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab broke up without a breakthrough. Discussions were said to have broken down after EU negotiators demanded a “backstop to the backstop” to prevent a return of a “hard border” between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Theresa May has proposed the backstop - which would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the single market while a permanent solution is found - should apply to the whole of the UK.However it is understood the EU is insisting it should be backed up by the original Northern Ireland-only backstop as it first proposed. That could lead to customs checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK - effectively imposing a “border in the Irish Sea” - something May has said is unacceptable. “Backstop to the backstop” is an ingenious piece of branding. It makes it sound as if the EU is demanding something new. But in fact the EU has always argued that the backstop plan - the scheme to avoid a hard border in Ireland, if the overall Brexit trade and customs agreement does not achieve this - should involve Northern Ireland effectively remaining in the single market and the customs union. The British government published a partial plan in June for a backstop involving the UK as a whole effectively staying in the customs union. But this plan did not cover single market regulatory aspects, and the EU said it would not suffice on its own because there would be checks at the border in Ireland unless goods circulating in Northern Ireland complied with single market regulations.Here is our overnight story about the state of the talks.Labour are pushing for a Commons statement.

According to audience-monitoring charity Audience Agency, younger people are in such short supply at the theatre that the typical crowd’s average age is 52 years old. This lot, it seems, are the exceptions.The group are taking a week-long theatre course that’s part of ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative, which works in partnership with the Prince’s Trust, to give people aged 16–25 not in education or employment a leg-up. The initiative includes starter courses in all sorts of digitally-focused creative industries that you might expect the younger generation to opt for instead of fusty old theatre, so what’s the allure of this most analogue of mediums?“It’s an evolving art form, which fascinates me,” says 21-year-old Freddie Apperly. “What’s considered the norm of theatrical practices today, could be old school and prehistoric in 20 years’ time.” Considering the proliferation of immersive theatre, and the cross-pollination of mediums evident in entertainment such as Secret Cinema and escape rooms, it’s hard to disagree with him.For Laurie Weston, 22, a grounding in theatre is the ideal way to pick up transferable skills. “It’s a great way to learn collaboration and teamwork,” he says. “You’ve got actors who bounce off each other, then you’ve also got people who design the set, sound and lighting who all have to work closely together to get the cues right.”To other young people, the very fact that theatre isn’t a primarily digital medium is all part of the appeal. “Curiosity drove me because I just wanted to know how it works,” says 18-year-old Harry Bell, who’s keen to get backstage to find out more about sound and lighting. “I went to see Chicago with school – now, I can’t remember a thing about Chicago, but I just remember thinking: ‘How are they getting those actors’ voices from there to my ears?’ I wanted to know how it worked, the acoustics of the theatre, I wanted to understand that.”As well as a reputation for appealing to older generations, theatre also carries an image of inaccessibility and elitism at a grassroots level. And while today’s would-be thesps are well aware of the barriers to entry, it seems these are not enough to put them off. For 20-year-old Danni Manley, it just means being more selective about the doors you try to shove your foot in. “I went to apply for drama schools, but you have to pay to audition and I couldn’t afford them all, so I only did two out of three,” she says. “It’s quite annoying. It doesn’t put me off, it just makes it harder.”Bell, for one, is taken by a medium that offers an alternative to the polished, nipped and tucked output of most digital media consumed through a screen. “With theatre, you can’t really fix anything in post,” he says. “You have to get it right, there and then. That’s definitely something I want to do, without a doubt in my mind.”To find out more about ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative visit skodadsi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcea54fddc362db29806267451127267b580c543/0_127_8167_4900/master/8167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=399ff83ffcd61f37e8bff8e7ca41db77","title":"stephen hendry yips snooker interview","story":"“It was a mixture of embarrassment, anger, frustration, sadness, everything,” Stephen Hendry says as he remembers how his dominance of snooker unravelled into, in his mind, a shambling wreck of a game. When the end came, in the quarter-finals of the 2012 world championships, Hendry was so besieged by psychological demons “there was nothing positive left.”Hendry’s favourite sportsmen are Tiger Woods, Michael Schumacher, Nick Faldo and AP McCoy and he was once as imperious as they had been. He holds the record for the most world titles, with all seven being won in the 1990s, and he was world No 1 for eight successive seasons. But the great champions feel it most when vulnerability takes over.“It started about 12 years before the end,” Hendry says of his slow decline. “Of course it’s psychological and, when you strike a cue ball, you’re supposed to accelerate through the ball. But as you tighten up you end up decelerating. By 2012 my game was shot. You’re sitting on your chair watching players leagues below you play shots you can’t. That destroyed me.”In his new book, which provides graphic insight into this implosion, Hendry accepts that people compare his condition to a golfer’s ‘yips’. He scrunches up his face. “That trivialises it. I hate the word because it’s much more than that.”It resulted in humiliation for Hendry. He had to qualify for his final world championships by playing at the Institute of Sport in Sheffield instead of his beloved Crucible. “It felt degrading. That’s no disrespect to other players but I had owned the Crucible for a decade with seven wins and two finals.”Hendry ground his way through qualifying and in the first round against Stuart Bingham at the Crucible he sank a 147 maximum. Hendry had already decided to retire and become an ambassador for 8-ball pool in China. “I got to the Crucible having flown to China and back, with one day there to meet my new employers. Somehow, the 147 came about. It was amazing because, of the 36 shots, only six were played properly. My game had debilitated so far it was mostly shots I wasn’t hitting properly. I’d given every shot a pint of blood to get it in the pocket. The outsider was probably saying, ‘That’s amazing.’ Inside, it felt horrible.”He beat John Higgins in the second round but, 3-0 down to Stephen Maguire in the quarters, it was over. “Clearing up in the fourth frame, I knew if I didn’t get perfectly on the blue I’d leave myself this pink. So consequently, on the brown, you’re thinking about two shots later and ‘I can’t play it.’ I was finished.”He admired the way in which Woods, at his most swaggering, rarely looked surprised or elated when winning. “I really empathise with that. When you get a trophy why go jumping and crying? Winning’s a great feeling but everything else is an anti-climax. I really had to force a smile because winning was my job.”In his book, Hendry details the way in which his manager, Ian Doyle, controlled him. Doyle even made Hendry break-up with his girlfriend, Mandy, because he believed the young Scot should be consumed by snooker. Later, when he had finally married Mandy, Hendry horrified Doyle by mixing with other players. But Hendry believes now that losing his Ice-Man image undermined him.“Without a doubt. In the 90s, I never socialised with other players. That changed. I wanted to spend more time in the players’ lounge. I became friendly with Mark Williams. There’s no doubt it affected my invincibility. Ronnie O’Sullivan is still the best player in the world on his day now and he doesn’t mix with the players. You need that coldness. But I missed out as a teenager and thought: ‘I want to enjoy being with people and going out for dinner.’ It was to my detriment as a competitive animal.”During his 26-year career Hendry straddled different eras and faced a range of compelling players from Alex Higgins to O’Sullivan. He describes how drink once ran through the game. “Jimmy White and the others would have half a lager while playing. Bill Werbeniuk had to start drinking four hours before a match. He had this condition where he either took beta blockers, which were banned, or alcohol to calm his heart rate. If he had a match at 10 in the morning, he got up at six to start drinking beer. Alex obviously liked to drink. Sometimes we practised and he used the table to hold himself up. But he still played unbelievable snooker.”Higgins was initially kind to Hendry but, “it turned to resentment. He directed it at Steve Davis and then me because Alex believed he made snooker. In a way he was right. But when he wasn’t as good as us he couldn’t cope.”Hendry was still disappointed when many younger players failed to travel with him to Belfast for Higgins’s funeral in 2010. He feels even deeper affection for White, his boyhood hero, whom he beat in four of his seven world championship final victories.He smiles with nostalgia rather than in judgement. “Kenny Dalglish said, ‘Show me a good loser and I’ll show you a loser.’ Jimmy was an amazing loser. I’m sure inside he was devastated but he never showed it. If I’d had lost that final, I would be inconsolable.”Hendry was still a teenager when Davis demolished him in every game of a six-match exhibition. “I hated it, losing to Steve night after night but I would do the same in his position. I’d be willing to kill the young upstart every night.”Davis didn’t compliment Hendry when the Scot finally beat him – and Hendry shared that mentality. “I’d practised with John Higgins for years and when he became world champion I couldn’t congratulate him. A normal person says, ‘Well done.’ I couldn’t. It didn’t matter if it was my best friend, my brother, I didn’t want anyone else to win. It still hurts me, watching people win at the Crucible. Steve let it go years ago. That’s why he played longer than me. He treated it as a day out. I could never do that.”Hendry and O’Sullivan have fallen out occasionally but, now, ‘We get on. Mates is probably too strong a word because Ronnie is complex. There are times you’ll be his best friend and times he’ll virtually not say hello to you.”There is, instead, respect and rivalry. “Ronnie’s the best player I’ve ever seen and people forget I actually played him. I was obviously on my way down and he gave me some hammerings.”Hendry responds emphatically when asked what would happen if he and O’Sullivan met each other at their very peak. “I believe I would win. If we had a four-session match, where things change, I would back myself every time. I was stronger mentally. But he’s more talented than me, making shots left-handed and sinking a 147 in 4½ minutes. My fastest maximum would be over nine minutes.”Flying to China 15 times a year, to promote Chinese pool, and working as a UK snooker pundit, Hendry admits that, “compared to the 1990s life now is dull. Back then you were the world’s best player. Nothing could touch you. I’ve not got a bad life now but I have days where I think: ‘What is there to look forward to? What’s the buzz?’”He takes solace in his belief that, as arguably the greatest snooker player in history, his world championship record of victories remains safe. “I can’t see anyone beating it. O’Sullivan’s got five. He can do it if he keeps playing. But there are four others playing at that level. At his absolute best, Ronnie wins. But he’s getting to that age where he’s not doing it often. He’ll talk all sorts of bullshit, saying he doesn’t care about the record. But deep down he wants to beat me while, of course, I want to hold on to the record.”Hendry sounds, briefly, like a perennial winner again. But he is too likeable now not to give in to honesty as, considering his involvement in a new senior circuit, he admits his game is still ruined. “I’ve played it a few times and in practice I’m fine because no-one’s watching. But once it starts I’m totally embarrassed by my shots. It’s horrible.”The 49-year-old former world champion laughs ruefully. He then shakes his head when asked if he will ever free himself of these demons. “There’re probably people out there who think they can cure me but it’s a mental thing. At exhibitions I have a couple of drinks before I play to relax. It works sometimes but that’s not a way out. I have to live with it now.”Stephen Hendry’s Me and the Table is available from bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d422d9ba3e8ccf25ecd244698c7991640379ba5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74ab903e2c5c882ecadfe00485c956dd","title":"rugby union talking points from the weekend european action","story":"Toulon’s nightmare speaks to French woes, Saracens are miles ahead of the pack and Freddie Burns had a weekend to forgetIt seemed as if all talking points would have to revolve around the 52-3 destruction on Friday night of the former multiple champions Wasps by Leinster – or the Ireland team plus James Lowe, which means the Ireland team in a couple of years’ time. But then Freddie Burns came along. Immediately all talking points became other examples of the flagrant squandering of tries. There are plenty but it is hard to think of any at such a crucial juncture of a game, to cost a team a match and coming so soon after the same player had missed a sitter of a penalty, which would also have won the encounter. It will surely take its toll on Burns. Bath, meanwhile, are sick of wasted opportunities.Of all the chastening results for the English over the first two days perhaps the most sobering was the inability of Exeter, now installed in the top two of the Premiership, to prevail over Munster at home. It is as if they were spooked by having to take on their own doubles. Munster played more like Exeter than Exeter, and vice versa. A dour 616 metres were chiselled out by the relentless ball-carriers, Munster the only side this weekend to fail to average two metres a carry, with 250 from 130. Still, the same tactic makes Thomond Park almost as formidable a lair as it used to be. Gloucester go there next week. The onus is on Danny Cipriani to introduce a different dimension.If the weekend was a positive one, on the whole, for the Pro14, Pool 3 contained the most encouraging and dispiriting results. Cardiff’s win at Lyon, flying so high in the Top 14, was as invigorating as any the Welsh have managed in Europe. The Blues have been Wales’s great underachievers but they are bristling with back-rows and have serious talent behind. Glasgow, meanwhile, might not be in Leinster’s class but they are fixtures now at or near the top of the Pro14. Here they ran into the Saracens brick wall. They say the Premiership is a two-speed affair. Actually it is three: the others, Exeter and then Saracens – not at their best in Glasgow but brutal and light‑fingered by turns.Ulster are a bit of a mess in the Pro14 but that does not need to matter when taking on Leicester at the moment. The Tigers’ capitulation in the second half felt gruesomely familiar. Curiously their England half-backs are playing quite well. George Ford was given a very unfortunate yellow card in the first half but Leicester survived that before falling away in the pouring rain of the second. The jury is still out on Ulster but a trip to Racing next week ought to hasten a verdict. The Parisian club survived the lightning strikes of the Scarlets to clinch a late away victory. They look the likeliest contenders from this pool and from the Top 14 in general.A disappointing weekend for the French, and Pool 4 showed them up the most. Toulon have fallen far and fast from the heights of only a handful of years ago. Saracens tore them apart two years ago, the first team to win at Stade Mayol in the Champions Cup. Now Newcastle have become the second, despite currently sitting bottom in the Premiership. Toulon, mind you, are off the relegation zone only by points difference. They look stroppy, uninterested and at times just witless. How are the mighty, etc. Montpellier, meanwhile, very much one of the Top 14’s current leading lights, got away with murder at home to Edinburgh. The Scots were incredibly unlucky to be denied a potentiallywinning try. They may yet surprise in this pool.There is nothing new about kicking penalties to the corner, but teams seem so confident now of their chances of driving a lineout over that the corner is becoming more sought after than the good old-fashioned three points. The policy was adopted time and again this weekend and reached a new height of lunacy when Toulon turned down three late points – despite trailing by one.To standout among this Leinster team, which is basically the Ireland team, takes some doing. Lowe was virtually unplayable, running by far the most metres (164), scoring two tries (although it felt like more) and generally creating mayhem. What is more, he qualifies for that Ireland team in two years’ time. They cannot wait.No red cards – and yet time and again contact was made between shoulderarm and head during this fast-moving and physical sport. Thankfully, referees showed sense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/965cfcbc7a7b05a88f7366e887b8178c57395c0e/0_144_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff3792059213736ed3177913a0e038b7","title":"blockchain democracy decentralisation bitcoin price cryptocurrencies","story":"Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin result in the concentration of wealth, not greater equalityFaced with the public spectacle of a market bloodbath, boosters have fled to the last refuge of the crypto scoundrel: a defence of “blockchain,” the distributed-ledger software underpinning all cryptocurrencies. Blockchain has been heralded as a potential panacea for everything from poverty and famine to cancer. In fact, it is the most overhyped – and least useful – technology in human history.In practice, blockchain is nothing more than a glorified spreadsheet. But it has also become the byword for a libertarian ideology that treats all governments, central banks, traditional financial institutions, and real-world currencies as evil concentrations of power that must be destroyed. Blockchain fundamentalists’ ideal world is one in which all economic activity and human interactions are subject to anarchist or libertarian decentralisation. They would like the entirety of social and political life to end up on public ledgers that are supposedly “permissionless” (accessible to everyone) and “trustless” (not reliant on a credible intermediary such as a bank).Yet far from ushering in a utopia, blockchain has given rise to a familiar form of economic hell. A few self-serving white men (there are hardly any women or minorities in the blockchain universe) pretending to be messiahs for the world’s impoverished, marginalised and unbanked masses claim to have created billions of dollars of wealth out of nothing. But one need only consider the massive centralisation of power among cryptocurrency “miners,” exchanges, developers and wealth holders to see that blockchain is not about decentralisation and democracy it is about greed.For example, a small group of companies – mostly located in such bastions of democracy as Russia, Georgia and China – control between two-thirds and three-quarters of all crypto-mining activity and all routinely jack up transaction costs to increase their fat profit margins. Apparently, blockchain fanatics would have us put our faith in an anonymous cartel subject to no rule of law, rather than trust central banks and regulated financial intermediaries.Moreover, the centralisation of crypto development – for example, fundamentalists have named Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin a “benevolent dictator for life” – already has given lie to the claim that “code is law,” as if the software underpinning blockchain applications is immutable. The truth is that the developers have absolute power to act as judge and jury. When something goes wrong in one of their buggy “smart” pseudo-contracts and massive hacking occurs, they simply change the code and “fork” a failing coin into another one by arbitrary fiat, revealing the entire “trustless” enterprise to have been untrustworthy from the start.As should be clear, the claim of “decentralisation” is a myth propagated by the pseudo-billionaires who control this pseudo-industry. Now that the retail investors who were suckered into the crypto market have all lost their shirts, the snake-oil salesmen who remain are sitting on piles of fake wealth that will immediately disappear if they try to liquidate their “assets”.As for blockchain itself, there is no institution under the sun – bank, corporation, non-governmental organisation or government agency – that would put its balance sheet or register of transactions, trades and interactions with clients and suppliers on public decentralised peer-to-peer permissionless ledgers. There is no good reason why such proprietary and highly valuable information should be recorded publicly.Moreover, in cases where distributed-ledger technologies – so-called enterprise DLT – are actually being used, they have nothing to do with blockchain. They are private, centralised and recorded on just a few controlled ledgers. They require permission for access, which is granted to qualified iniduals. And, perhaps most important, they are based on trusted authorities that have established their credibility over time. All of which is to say, these are “blockchains” in name only.It is telling that all “decentralised” blockchains end up being centralised, permissioned databases when they are actually put into use. As such, blockchain has not even improved upon the standard electronic spreadsheet, which was invented in 1979.No serious institution would ever allow its transactions to be verified by an anonymous cartel operating from the shadows of the world’s authoritarian kleptocracies. So it is no surprise that whenever “blockchain” has been piloted in a traditional setting, it has either been thrown in the trash bin or turned into a private permissioned database that is nothing more than an Excel spreadsheet or a database with a misleading name.• Nouriel Roubini, a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and CEO of Roubini Macro Associates, was Senior Economist for International Affairs in the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton Administration.

The result is a winning blend of beach life, bohemian bars and great seafoodTo understand Falmouth (and arguably the rest of our island nation) you need to understand its relationship with the sea. The cavernous National Maritime Museum Cornwall, a beautiful building in itself, contains several floors of exhibitions that explore the changing influence of the sea on our lives – stories of discovery, survival and tragedy – and an active traditional boat workshop. Highlights include the undersea gallery in which visitors can watch fish swimming in the harbour from the sea bed, and the 30-metre lookout tower from which they can track the comings and goings of naval ships, superyachts, dinghies and cruise liners.The museum is popular with families who come for the performances, storytelling and treasure trails during the holidays, and warrants multiple visits, which is handy, especially when the weather turns. Celebrating its 15th birthday in 2018, the museum was central to the regeneration of Discovery Quay, now the focus for the town’s many festivals. The museum’s major exhibition, Titanic Stories explores the controversies, myths and stories that surround the best-known sinking of the 20th century. • Adult £13.50, child £6 (pay once, get in all year), open daily, nmmcOnce a spit-and-sawdust pub that served the crews of the Falmouth Working Boats, the Star and Garter, which opened in 1892, is now a smart gastro pub that prides itself on its nose-to-tail menu. The pub and the three self-catering apartments that sit above it command some of the best views across Falmouth harbour towards the Roseland peninsular on the opposite side of the Fal estuary. It is perhaps the best place on land from which to watch the regular squalls that blow into town, the brightly coloured topsails of the Working Boats as they race on the estuary during summer, or as they dredge for wild Fal oysters under sail in winter. • One- and two-bedroom apartments from £120, starandgarter.squarespaceFalmouth has no lack of coffee shops, and while the cafe scene is dominated by Espressini, which has two outlets in town, it’s easy to overlook smaller cafes such as Jam Records, with its two cracked leather sofas and a selection of new and used vinyl. Visitors should expect eclectic music with their cuppa, shabby chic and a charming, if unexpected, display of typewriters, TV monitors and ancient Macintosh computers – which is somewhat indicative of how Falmouth rolls.• 32 High Street, jamrecordsFor a small town, Falmouth has an art gallery that punches well above its weight. There are only three exhibition rooms, so some of Falmouth Art Gallery’s best works are often not on public display. But ask nicely at the desk and you could get a tour of the storerooms, where paintings by the town’s two Royal Academicians – Charles Napier Hemy and Henry Scott Tuke – rub shoulders with paintings by Pablo Picasso, John Singer Sergeant and John Williams Waterhouse.

HAND bar and bottle shop offers over 200 craft beers, and on a warm evening drinkers spill out into the yard and create the sort of atmosphere you’d expect to find in Berlin or Seville rather than Cornwall. The Chintz is a different matter entirely. The small, Alice in Wonderland-themed bar is gaudily kitted out in rococo style and offers wine, cheese and charcuterie. There are also regular live music. Expect –blues, retro soul, funk and jazz – and spoken word nights.Aside from glimpses of the water through the opes – passageways between shops on the high street and the water – in the centre of town it’s easy to forget that Falmouth is a seaside town.

Pendennis Point gives some of the best opportunities to spot sea life, as well as super-yachts making their way to Pendennis Shipyard, which fits out boats for the rich and famous. On a clear day it’s possible to see the Manacles rocks on Cornwall’s Lizard peninsula. The headland is dominated by Henry VIII’s iconic fort, Pendennis Castle, the gateway to Falmouth from the sea. Squint – to block out the modern boats and naval ships – across to the castle’s near-twin on the Roseland, St Mawes, and it’s possible to get an idea of what Falmouth was like almost 500 years ago.Pendennis Point car park is also the starting point for an excellent walk on the South West Coast Path taking in three of Falmouth’s town beaches: Gyllingvase, Swanpool and Maenporth.It’s easy to tell when there are waves worth surfing at Gyllingvase beach, from the hordes of surfers running down to the sea with boards beneath their arms. While many surfers favour Cornwall’s north coast, surf culture is very much alive in Falmouth. Independent surf shop Freeriders sells low-key surf wear as well as used and custom boards from local shapers. In a bid to become a hub for the surf community, it has recently added a cafe and cinema space. • The Moor, freeriders.coFalmouth’s creativity is visible in the number of independent craft shops in town, and the main street heaves with galleries. The highest concentration is at the top of the High Street and ranges from bookbinder Juniper Bespoke to local potters who create works while manning their shops.

She knows there is something different about their daughter’s development, and is petrified by the dawning realisation that her baby has a serious learning disability.Even in a TV landscape swarming with stony-faced sad-coms, it may seem as though the premise of There She Goes is stretching the limits of comedy to breaking point. In fact, for most of its runtime, the new show from Have I Got News For You writer Shaun Pye manages to spin its heartbreaking subject matter into something not just moving, but mordantly, outrageously funny.Based on Pye’s own experiences of having a daughter with a rare chromosomal disorder, the show knits together two timelines. One focuses on the months following the birth, during which the parents (David Tennant and Jessica Hynes) become increasingly sure there is something wrong with their daughter. The other takes place a decade further down the line, as they sanguinely navigate the trials of caring for a nine-year-old with severe learning difficulties (in the case of Tennant’s character, this is achieved with generous helpings of un-PC humour).Ultimately, watching There She Goes is an uplifting experience, a drawn-out demonstration of how the pain, anger and disappointment that comes from parenthood not going to plan can eventually give way to unexpected joy. Yet it’s also a series determined not to dress that pain, anger and disappointment up in cosy sentimentality – or couch it in a parable about the saintly self-sacrifice of motherhood.Hynes is spectacular as Emily, an academic who quickly notices that her daughter’s behaviour bears little resemblance to that of their elder son, despite the reassurances of those around her. Her reaction is to doubt everything: her mind the medical establishment and, most crucially, her own maternal instinct. Will it wither away in the face of such a challenge?What is perhaps most remarkable about There She Goes’ willingness to shine a bright light on the desolation often felt in early motherhood is that it’s not the only show on the BBC this autumn to do so. The Cry, starring the erstwhile Doctor Who companion Jenna Coleman, is about an isolated young mother struggling to maintain her sanity after giving birth to a baby who won’t stop wailing. Tonally, it couldn’t be further from There She Goes’ cathartic humour and studious realism – The Cry soon descends into a uniquely horrifying thriller – but both shows construct drama around the same kernel of unwelcome truth.Generally, women are encouraged to put up and shut up about the negative side-effects of motherhood for moral reasons: it’s ungrateful to complain about a healthy child who won’t sleep it’s cruel to question your feelings towards any baby and if you discuss your traumatic labour you risk damaging other women’s mental health (a recent debate asked whether mothers posting stories about their difficult births online was responsible for a rise in tocophobia, the pathological fear of childbirth).Last year, however, TV finally began to protest against this societally imposed silence. Sharon Horgan’s uproarious sitcom Motherland exposed the mind-frazzling frenzy of life as a working mum Australian comedy The Letdown captured the sleep-deprived farce that is looking after a newborn Boston-set sitcom SMILF delved into the struggle of single-motherhood and US comic Ali Wong’s Netflix specials drilled down into her and her friends’ birth injuries. Meanwhile, tear-jerking comedy Mum took a long-term look at motherhood, exploring the way a life of maternal sacrifice feels from the inside.Thanks to There She Goes’ split narrative, we know that everything turns out OK in the end. Emily no longer spends her days in the throes of mental anguish, or anything remotely resembling it – and she does come to love her daughter. But the show doesn’t pretend her life is easy. Rather than being depressing or frightening, however, the effect is oddly consoling: it puts something concrete and matter-of-fact in the place of mysterious sacrifices and shadowy fears. It is no secret that motherhood is hard, but just how hard it can be is still kept largely under wraps. Let’s hope There She Goes is the first of many such unveilings.There She Goes begins on 16 October at 10pm on BBC4 The Cry continues on Sundays at 9pm on BBC One."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7afb13c13c3be638a7d5b6445a897a251b6d3da4/0_61_3670_2202/master/3670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e6dfc15ecd4e59a768296a8e8529afa","title":"bavaria poll humiliation for angela merkel conservative allies","story":"Exit polls show CSU losing majority it has long enjoyed as far-right AfD makes gainsAngela Merkel’s conservative partners in Bavaria have had their worst election performance for more than six decades, in a humiliating state poll result that is likely to further weaken Germany’s embattled coalition government.Markus Söder, the prime minister of Bavaria, called it a “difficult day” for the CSU, but said his party had a clear mandate to form a government.Annalena Baerbock, the co-leader of the Greens, said: “Today Bavaria voted to uphold human rights and humanity.”Andrea Nahles, the leader of the SPD, delivered the briefest of reactions at her party’s headquarters in Berlin, calling the results “bitter” and blaming them on the poor performance of the grand coalition in Berlin.Katrin Ebner-Steiner of the AfD told jubilant party supporters she would spend the next five years “representing your strong voice” at a time when Germany and Bavaria were in a “dreadful state” over migration. “We’re cut from a different wood from the bloodless mainstream parties,” she said, promising to “fight for victory not for us, but for Bavaria”.The CSU, the sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), has ridden for decades on a ticket of folksy beerhall rhetoric and pledges to protect the heimat (homeland), combined with the drive for economic success – often referred to as “laptop and lederhosen”.Merkel did not react to the results, but the CDU’s general secretary, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, called them “bitter … but not surprising”, citing the governmental infighting of recent months. She said the party would urgently consult before a state election in Hesse in two weeks’ time. “We need to address the issues which are burning under people’s fingernails,” she added.The party more or less took for granted its dominant position as the standalone leader in Bavaria, but its power base started to erode with the demise of the mainstream political landscape across Germany and elsewhere in Europe.However, the dramatic slide in the CSU’s fortunes coincided with the arrival of about 1 million refugees to Germany in the summer of 2015 through Bavaria, causing uncertainty and some xenophobia.The CSU leadership under Söder and the party leader, Horst Seehofer – who is also the federal interior minister – did its best to blame the growing sense of instability in Bavaria on Merkel’s refugee policy.In an effort to tackle the backlash against Muslim refugees, it introduced a law requiring classrooms and public buildings to hang the crucifix and ban the full-face Islamic veils.The fallout over the refugee crisis and disputes between Seehofer and Merkel over how to control Germany’s border have almost led to the collapse of her fragile coalition.But in the weeks running up to the election, successive polls showed the CSU’s hardline stance and its near-success in causing the government’s collapse had prompted a haemorrhaging of voters to other parties.The CSU’s dismal result leaves in doubt the political futures of both Söder and Seehofer.Speaking on Sunday evening, Seehofer said the party would “draw the necessary consequences” from the poor result over the following weeks, but did not refer to his or Söder’s futures.The forthcoming makeup of the Bavarian government is unclear, although the Greens have signalled their willingness to enter a coalition with the CSU, which in turn is uneasy about such an alliance. Statistically, the CSU could also form a government with the Free Voters, with whom they have considerably more in common.Reacting to the vote, Thomas Steinleitner, a 50-year-old baker from the town of Deggendorf who abandoned the CSU for the first time, said the party had lost touch with its supporters.“They just repeated what the AfD said, and I don’t identify with them any more. The CSU and CDU – all the big parties – it feels like they work together with industry, but us normal people are not important to them,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52e31aca7cc8e5b30833508fc6b3468379af6ae4/629_688_3576_2145/master/3576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c460bbfd1b26dbe8c97a105a7ca066a","title":"jamal khashoggi turkey looks to uk to persuade saudi arabia to cooperate","story":"JP Morgan and Ford join ranks of companies pulling out of Saudi conference as UK, Germany and France call for credible investigationSaudi Arabia has said it will retaliate against any sanctions imposed over the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, as JP Morgan and Ford swelled the ranks of western companies pulling out of a high-profile conference in Riyadh next week.The diplomatic standoff over the fate of Khashoggi, who has been missing since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October and is presumed to have been murdered, threatens Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s to reform efforts to reform the kingdom’s economy. The Riyadh stock market had its biggest fall in years on Sunday.Donald Trump has threatened the US ally with “severe punishment” if Khashoggi, who has been critical of Bin Salman, has been killed.The French, German and UK foreign secretaries ratcheted up the pressure by releasing a joint statement calling on the Saudi government to give a complete and detailed account of Khashoggi’s disappearance, adding that those found to be responsible must be held to account.Riyadh vowed to hit back against any action. “The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether through economic sanctions, political pressure or repeating false accusations,” it said.The country’s foreign ministry issued a series of tweets rejecting the accusations as “attempts to undermine” Saudi Arabia, writing in one post “demise is the outcome of these weak endeavors”.Business leaders as well as media companies including Bloomberg and CNN have pulled out of an investment conference next week in Riyadh, dubbed “Davos in the desert”.Jamie Dimon, the powerful boss of JP Morgan, on Sunday became the latest to say he would not be attending. Ford chief executive Bill Ford also announced he would not be going. Neither gave a reason for the cancellations.The belligerence of the Saudi statement is likely to anger US senators pressing for the Trump administration to take tough economic action against Riyadh, including sanctions.It showed no sign of contrition or clarification of the promise last week to conduct an inquiry into Khashoggi’s disappearance. Instead, Riyadh condemned a “campaign of false allegations and falsehoods”. In what is likely to be a reference to Turkey, and possibly its Gulf rival Qatar, Saudi Arabia claimed some were “rushing and seeking to exploit rumours and accusations to achieve goals and agendas unrelated to the search for truth”.Saudi Arabia’s vast oil reserves, said to be about 260bn barrels, give it enormous clout in the global economy. It has significant power to drive up prices, which would hurt every major developed economy.Turki Aldhakhil, the general manager of Al Arabiya, the official Saudi news channel, claimed in an opinion piece that Riyadh was ready to implement 30 measures “without flinching” the moment US sanctions were imposed, including cuts to oil production that could lead to prices rising to $100 a barrel.“The truth is that if Washington imposes sanctions on Riyadh, it will stab its own economy to death, even though it thinks that it is stabbing only Riyadh,” he wrote.Aldhakhil warned the repercussions of US sanctions could include a military alliance between Saudi Arabia and Russia, and an end to intelligence sharing.In the firmest joint language to appear from Europe since the crisis broke, the European foreign ministers said “light must be shed on Khashoggi’s disappearance”.They said they shared the “grave concerns” expressed by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and “are treating this incident with the utmost seriousness. There needs to be a credible investigation to establish the truth about what happened, and – if relevant – to identify those bearing responsibility for the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi and ensure that they are held to account.”The statement added: “We encourage joint Saudi-Turkish efforts in that regard, and expect the Saudi government to provide a complete and detailed response. We have conveyed this message directly to the Saudi authorities.”Over the weekend, Turkey pressed the UK to use its influence to ensure Saudi Arabia abides by its commitment to launch a joint investigation into Khashoggi’s disappearance.The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, is due to meet his British counterpart, Jeremy Hunt, in London on Monday afternoon. He complained that Saudi Arabia was not allowing Turkish investigators to enter the consulate.Speaking on Sunday, Hunt said: “What they need to do is cooperate fully with the investigations … and to get to the bottom of this.“If, as they say, this terrible murder didn’t happen then where is Jamal Khashoggi? If they have got nothing to hide then they will, and should, cooperate.” The UK also suggested the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, may withdraw from the investment conference if it is shown the Saudi government was involved in the suspected murder.The official UK position is that Fox’s diary for that week is yet to be finalised. Any British action is likely to be coordinated with the US.Speaking at the weekend, Trump said – without being specific – there were “very powerful” things the west could do to hurt the Saudis, but stopping arms sales would in the end be America punishing itself.Democratic senators on the US foreign relations committee said classified intelligence briefings suggested Khashoggi had been murdered by the Saudis or rendered back to Saudi Arabia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d3ae4b850971f6d0e4f219bcbc41a2dca1d155/0_88_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55a0b241ef03d1859013c812937ea17b","title":"canada money laundering casino vancouver model","story":"The impacts of the Vancouver model - as the scheme came to be known - is linked to the opioid crisis and unaffordable real estate marketThe briefing took place just a few days after David Eby began his new job as British Columbia’s attorney general – and it began a warning.“Get ready,” Eby remembers being told by casino regulators in the western Canadian province. “I think we are going to blow your mind.”What they showed him was footage of iniduals wheeling suitcases stuffed with $20 bills into casinos. Others used hockey bags to haul the cash. Surveillance videos then showed the iniduals trading in the cash for casino chips.It was Eby’s first glimpse of what some in the global intelligence community had taken to calling the Vancouver model – a scheme in which some of the province’s casinos were unwittingly used to launder more than C$100m during the past decade.“We are famous internationally – or, more accurately, we have become infamous – for money laundering,” Eby told a federal parliamentary committee earlier this year.“It’s just mind boggling,” Eby told the  in an interview. “The sheer volume and the size of these transactions on a regular basis in casinos is just astounding.”Soon after that first, eye-opening briefing in 2017, Eby’s government introduced measures aimed at curbing the transnational scheme demanding proof of a legitimate source for casino payments of more than C$10,000and round-the-clock surveillance by regulators at high risk establishments.These efforts have sent suspicious transactions at casinos plummeting 100-fold since 2015, according to government estimates.Still, the impacts of this cash flow – much of it linked to criminal organisations – are believed to have been felt across the province. “I can tell you it is tied to the opioid crisis that has taken thousands of people from their families,” said Eby. “It’s linked to the real estate market and housing prices that have made life unaffordable for British Columbians.”Earlier this year, Eby’s office tasked a former police officer and money laundering expert with delving into the model. Peter German’s first report, made public in June, outlined how the scheme worked and linked the practice to wealthy Chinese citizens seeking to circumvent their own country’s currency controls.Before traveling to Canada, ostensibly to gamble, these iniduals would arrange to have someone deliver cash to them in Vancouver or the surrounding regions. In exchange, they transfered money from their bank account in China to another account in China.“The money that they receive in Vancouver is the money that is the proceeds of some sort of crime – we just don’t quite know which. We have some guesses, but we don’t know yet,” said Eby. “They show up at the casino and someone meets them at the casino and gives them a box or bag full of cash and they then walk into the casino.”The stacks of neatly-bundled cash are used to buy casino chips. From there, any gambling losses flow into provincial coffers, while winnings come out clean.“At the end of the day, a gangster is able to pass off a bag full of 20s and end up with the money transferred into their bank account in China or somewhere else in the world,” said Eby. “And the person who is actually spending the laundered money at the casino – when they do the background checks – is not the actual criminal who generated the 20-dollar bills in the first place.”While these transactions have been worth as much as C$1.2m, said Eby, “the only real evidence of a problem is a guy lugging a hockey bag full of $20 bills into the casino.”The practice is believed to have started in 2009 – around the same time that provincial authorities turned over the policing of casinos to local police – reaching its apex in 2015. From there the amount of suspicious money flowing through the province’s casinos began to decline, amid heightened scrutiny by police and local media.Eby, a New Democrat politician whose party vaulted into power earlier this year, laid some of the blame on the province’s former Liberal government, accusing them of lax oversight during their 16 years in power.In his report, German suggested that infighting among the provincial agencies responsible for regulating gambling may have left casinos vulnerable to exploitation by criminal organisations from China, Colombia, Mexico and other countries.German shied away from blaming the gamblers at the heart of the scheme. “It must be remembered however, that many of the high limit gamblers who used dirty money to feed their gambling activities were dupes,” he noted. “Others were simply attempting to remove their own money from China, in order to make a life for themselves in Canada.”Eby’s office is currently waiting on a second report examining whether the scheme might have played a role in transforming Vancouver’s housing markets into one of the world’s least affordable. “We have a list of iniduals who are walking bulk cash into casinos in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and filling out forms that listed their occupations as being involved in the real estate markets,” said Eby. “We can’t ignore that red flag.”A 2016 report by Transparency International Canada found that nearly half of the 100 most expensive homes in Vancouver were bought using shell companies, trusts or nominees – structures that can be used to conceal the true identity of homeowners.“If you were driving around in your car and the police stopped you and you had hockey bag full of 20s in the backseat, there would be a lot of difficult questions you would have to answer,” said Eby. “But for some reason when you did the same thing in a casino, it was a relatively straightforward form that’s filled out – and that’s it. And then there’s no follow up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52656232ba7994dad80631ad1c8e29b632b08383/1543_115_718_431/master/718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=293b6de6a01bd73435049b89eea2bf63","title":"indian minister mobashar jawed akbar denies metoo allegations","story":"Mobashar Jawed Akbar says allegations made against him by 12 women are baselessAn Indian government minister accused of sexual misconduct by at least 12 women has said the claims are “wild and baseless” and filed a defamation lawsuit against one of his alleged victims.Mobashar Jawed Akbar, India’s junior foreign minister, returned from government business in Nigeria on Sunday to face mounting allegations he harassed or abused employees during his previous career as a journalist.“The allegations of misconduct made against me are false and fabricated, spiced up by innuendo and malice,” he said in a statement on Sunday. “Accusation without evidence has become a viral fever among some sections. Whatever be the case, now that I have returned, my lawyers will look into these wild and baseless allegations in order to decide our future course of legal action.”On Monday, he filed a lawsuit against the journalist Priya Ramani, the first of the women to name him as her alleged abuser.The lawsuit, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, names Ramani as the sole accused and says she “intentionally put forward malicious, fabricated and salacious” allegations to harm Akbar’s reputation.Ramani was not immediately reachable for comment.Akbar, 67, is one of the highest-profile figures to be named in the past fortnight as part of a wave of sexual misconduct allegations by Indian women that activists are calling the belated arrival of India’s #MeToo moment.He had been silent since the first accusation surfaced on Tuesday, when Ramani claimed he was the unnamed editor she had described sexually harassing her in a 2017 article for Vogue.At least 11 other women have come forward in the week since, the most recent on Friday when Majlie de Puy Kamp, a journalist with CNN in New York, said Akbar forcibly kissed her when she was an 18-year-old intern at his newspaper Asian Age in 2007.“What he did was disgusting, he violated my boundaries, betrayed my trust,” De Puy Kamp told Huffington Post India.India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has not commented on the allegations but the textiles minister, Smirti Irani, called for Akbar “to speak on this issue”. She said: “Anybody who is speaking out should in no way be shamed, anybody speaking out should in no way be victimised or mocked.”Amit Shah, the president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party, to which Akbar belongs, indicated on Saturday that the accusations would be looked at. “We will have to see if the allegations are true or false,” he said.As Akbar prepared to return to India on Sunday, several media outlets reported that he would resign or step aside pending an investigation. Instead he came out fighting, claiming the allegations were part of a political conspiracy before general elections scheduled for the first half of 2019.“Why has this storm risen a few months before a general election?” he asked. “Is there an agenda? You be the judge,” he said.More than a dozen Indian journalists, actors and musicians have been accused in the past fortnight of behaviour ranging from making inappropriate advances to violent sexual assault.Chetan Bhagat, a bestselling author, made a public apology after a woman posted screenshots of a conversation in which he said he was trying to “woo” her. Alok Nath, an actor, has been threatened with expulsion from an industry organisation after he was accused of raping the screenwriter Vinta Nanda, an allegation he denies.Akbar has been a prominent figure in Indian public life for decades as an author, the editor of several newspapers, a confidant of the former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and now as the only Muslim minister in India’s Hindu nationalist government.How the allegations against him are handled will be seen as an important indicator of whether the #MeToo accusations will usher in new standards for public figures.Harinder Baweja, one of the women who has accused Akbar, wrote on Twitter that his response and legal threats were absurd. “All the women who tried to deal with the trauma for two to three decades and were now encouraged to share their pain had the general election in mind?” she said.There are 48 members of parliament across India with cases registered against them relating to crimes against women, a quarter of them members of the BJP, according to statistics from the Association for Democratic Reforms thinktank."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c69f7a6f449c2b6420e6039ce5e310188f1c790/142_478_2484_1491/master/2484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=709bf272292f8cdc2ab252b135a91353","title":"teens tiaras quinceanera celebrations cuba havana diana markosian in pictures","story":"The quinceañera, the 15th birthday rite of passage into womanhood, is widely celebrated in Latino culture.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Farmleigh on a beautiful autumn day, the trees turning brown under a clear blue sky the kind of place you bring the family for a tramp along leaf-strewn paths on a Sunday afternoon.You could hear those families enjoying themselves outside while a minute’s silence was being observed in a meeting room for other families who have been sundered by cancer, and who were attending the launch of the support group for the women at the centre of the CervicalCheck controversy.The silence was for Emma Mhic Mhathúna, who was buried last Wednesday leaving five children behind for a woman identified only as Julie, who died a week ago leaving behind four children and two grandchildren and for the 18 other women who have died.“Silence,” as Stephen Teap, whose wife Irene died of cervical cancer two years ago, noted, “is the most deafening sound” for many of the women and families affected.“I don’t know what was worse – the day Irene died or the day I found out she could have lived,” Mr Teap told the meeting, referring to the day he learned her cervical cancer had been missed by two smear tests. “None of us wants to be part of this scandal.”Six months on since Vicky Phelan’s court settlement blew the lid on the botched audit of the CervicalCheck programme, it is clear that for many of the women involved, the hurt is undiminished.Galway woman Lorraine Walsh says she has drawn comfort in dealing with her cancer diagnosis from the support she has received from her fellow women and families involved in this “disaster”.“The day I found out I had cancer was what I thought was the worst day of my life. I was wrong the day I found out that I shouldn’t have got cancer had my smear been read properly was the worst day of my life.“I am now riddled every day with the awful thoughts of ‘what if?’ which has shaken me to my very core and challenged me mentally and emotionally beyond any physical or emotional challenges that I ever experienced before.”“It has been traumatic for all of us,” Ms Phelan remarked, though the women involved have been affected in “221 different ways”.“There was harm done to women. We all have been harmed and traumatised by the failure of the CervicalCheck programme.“Often people ask me, ‘You’re terminally ill, how come you are not crying and sad? How are you doing what you’re doing?’ I can only explain it by saying I have a new sense of purpose. This gives me purpose, that’s what I’m put here for.”A patently optimistic and analytical woman, Ms Phelan has attempted to process the enormity of her fate by following best practice for coping with trauma. With the shock of the original revelation of her cancer and her misread tests behind her, she has moved on to action and “meaning-making”.“I never saw myself as a campaigner. If you told me six months ago, I would have said ‘no feckin’ way’, but your heart takes over and you’re so passionate about what you’re doing that your head gets out of the way and you start talking. I haven’t stopped talking since.”Six months on, it is also clear that the full extent of the controversy may never become apparent. How many women’s slides were misread? How much negligence was involved? What difference would a different smear result have made to their health? We may never know.Even the name of the “221-plus” support group acknowledges that the exact number of women affected is not known. And may never be known, as only a minority of the group have consented to their slides being re-tested in a further review of smear tests to be carried out shortly in the UK."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3663271.1539539243!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"only one quarter of cervicalcheck women give consent for new review","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStephen Teap, Lorraine Walsh and Vicky Phelan at the launch of 221+ in Dublin on Sunday.A support group for the 221-plus women and their families affected by the CervicalCheck controversy has held its first meeting.The 221+ CervicalCheck Patient Support Group is funded by the Department of Health but will operate independently of the Health Service Executive.The group has been set up to represent the “known and unknown” women and families impacted by the CervicalCheck controversy by providing information, advice and support.The launch on Sunday heard presentations from some of those most prominently involved in advocating for the women, including Vicky Phelan, Lorraine Walsh and Stephen Teap, husband of Irene Teap, who died of cervical cancer in 2017.The intiative is supported by the Irish Cancer Society, Marie Keating Foundation and Irish Patients Association. The launch in Farmleigh in Dublin was attended by about 50 women andor family members.A High Court action by Ms Phelan, from Limerick, over her cervical cancer diagnosis brought the controversy to light. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2014 and told of the false negative in the smear test in September 2017. It later emerged that the smear tests of more than 200 women who were subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer had been re-categorised after an audit but most of the women were not informed about the audit.Twenty of the women have died, including Emma Mhic Mhathúna, who was buried last Wednesday just months after making a €7.5 million court settlement for her five children with the HSE and US laboratory Quest Diagnostics. Quest admitted misreading her slides and the admission of liability by the HSE related to failing to disclose the findings of cervical cancer. The new group aims to provide practical support for women with cervical cancer and the families of women who have died from the disease. Only about 50 of the 221 women at the centre of the controversy have consented to their smear tests being re-audited in a further review being carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , Ms Walsh told the meeting.The RCOG report will therefore be reflective of less than one-quarter of the women, she said, adding: “I’m not sure what kind of answer we will get from RCOG”.The RCOG review, which is unlikely to be completed until spring 2019, is looking at the slides of 1,850 women in total - the 221 women who were previously audited by the HSE and a further 1,630 whose cases were reported to the National Cancer Registry after they were diagnosed with cancer. Little is known about these Registry cases but Ms Walsh said 1,060 of these cases had had no previous cytology. She said it number of these women who had not had screening was “frightening”.Ms Walsh said she had drawn comfort in dealing with her cancer diagnosis from the support she has received from her fellow women and families involved this disaster. “The day I found out I had cancer was what I thought was the worst day of my life! I was wrong the day I found out that I shouldn’t have got cancer had my smear been read properly was the worst day of my life!”“I am now riddled every day with the awful thoughts of `what if?’ which has shaken me to my very core and challenged me mentally and emotionally beyond any physical or emotional challenges that I ever experienced before.” A scoping inquiry into the controversy by public health doctor Dr Gabriel Scally last month made a number of recommendations on how the Minister for Health and his officials should interact with the affected women and their families.Dr Scally said the Minister should give consideration to how women’s health issues can be give more consistent attention within the health system. He also said the Department of Health should examine current arrangements for patients to have access to their hospital medical records. Dr Scally has also called for compensation to be paid to the women."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3663509.1539551125!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vicky phelan calls for laws making health managers accountable","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCampaigner Vicky Phelan:  ‘We’re living in a country where people think they can get away with it at a management level and not be sanctioned.’ Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireWomen impacted by the CervicalCheck controversy have called for the introduction of new laws making managers in the public service accountable for the errors they make.Unless the law is changed, “we are going to keep having scandals of this nature again and again and people will not be held accountable,” Vicky Phelan, the Limerick woman whose court settlement last April brought the controversy to light, warned.Ms Phelan was speaking at the launch on Sunday of a new support group for the 221-plus women affected by the controversy. The 221+ CervicalCheck Patient Support Group, funded by the Department of Health for three years, will provide expertise and advice to the women, all of whom have been diagnosed with cervical cancer, and their families.Only about 50 of the 221-plus women have consented to their smear tests being re-audited in a Government-ordered review being carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) in the UK, the meeting heard.Some of the women have been advised not to give consent because their lawyers fear it may prove difficult to retrieve their slides afterwards for use in future litigation. The low consent rate means the review will struggle to establish how many women had their slides misread and what difference this made to their medical outcomes.Ms Phelan said she still felt it was correct that HSE director general Tony O’Brien and CervicalCheck clinical director Dr Grainne Flannelly stood down as a result of the controversy. However, she accepted that there wasn’t a cover-up “as such”.Group member Lorraine Walsh said the group would wait and see what came out of the further investigations being carried out by Dr Gabriel Scally, the public health doctor who carried out a scoping inquiry into the CervicalCheck controversy, before deciding whether further investigations were needed.“There are a lot of answers still to be answered. We’re pressing a pause button on deciding on a commission until we see what we get” from Dr Scally’s further work and the RCOG review,said Ms Walsh.Ms Phelan was diagnosed with cancer in 2014 and told of the false negative in the smear test in September 2017. It later emerged that the smear tests of more than 200 women who were subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer had been re-categorised after an audit, but most of the women were not informed about the audit.Twenty of these women have died of their cancer, and Sunday’s meeting observed a minute’s silence in memory of them.Meanwhile, the State is set to take over the operation of a large part of the smear test examination services for the CervicalCheck programme.All-night talks on Friday between the HSE and two laboratories currently providing the service resulted in agreement that about 15 staff of MedLab Pathology would be offered positions in the Irish public service. A second private lab, Quest Diagnostics, is being offered a contract extension at a higher price.The existing agreement with the labs was due to run out on Sunday but is being extended until the new deal is signed."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Backstop promise \u0026lsquocannot be time-limited\u0026rsquo, Minister for Foreign Affairs insistsDavid Dooley, originally from Tullamore, got into difficulty while walking along beachUnion\u0026rsquos move comes amid dispute over demand for job evaluation schemeMeetings with ministers must be formal and open to all bidders, says Dr Paul DavisDuffy names Emily Dickinson and Seamus Heaney when asked for favourite poetsGarda\u0026iacute in Ronanstown investigate after man taken to Tallaght hospital on Sunday nightEquate complains of campaign from groups opposed to making schools more inclusiveHealth decisions based on political expediency, says Sligo consultant Donal MurrayOnce popular first names now facing \u0026lsquoextinction\u0026rsquo in IrelandNumbers down 56,000 over seven years but charity says the \u0026lsquoworking poor\u0026rsquo do not qualifyMigrant Rights Centre Ireland says scheme will be \u0026lsquolife-changing\u0026rsquo for those eligibleLocals close ranks around the former minister as he opens heritage trail in RoscommonStand-off shows \u0026lsquolack of understanding\u0026rsquo between Travellers and settled communityProposal emerges to maintain vital link if no deal in talks with existing service providerScheme to protect farmers from claims by walkers with Attorney GeneralMother of three says back to school allowance covers less than a quarter of her costsUS visual artist Suzanne Lacy worked with 300-plus people for Ulster Museum projectLimerick woman speaks at launch of 221+ CervicalCheck Patient Support GroupNorth\u0026rsquos sheep sector faces \u0026lsquomajor problems\u0026rsquo, says Upper Bann MP David SimpsonCouncil \u0026lsquouncertainty\u0026rsquo over Shane Ross\u0026rsquos key project after State fails to cover harbour costs"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660278.1539269071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit the truck driver and 20 tonnes of frozen chicken","story":"Simon Carswell travels with truck driver Stephen Heasley to find out how post-Brexit customs checks could affect food supplies. Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyThe 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit. The 1998 Belfast Agreement (also known as the Good Friday Agreement) brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for checks along the Border. It also established North-South regulations and institutions that helped support the peace process. The Border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure or the creation of a hard border.It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials, border inspectors, police or military. The fear is that the return of customs officials or border inspectors would be so unacceptable to people who travel freely across an open border that it would lead to anger and, potentially, violence. That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.Neither party to the negotiations to both the withdrawal agreement and any future trade agreement post-Brexit wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text - not just a political declaration - around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland. It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Brussels believes a hard border can be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit. This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries. Northern Ireland would also stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules.It has not offered one yet. It does not want a hard border but has not said how it would achieve this by way of a backstop while still proceeding with its plan to leave the EU single market and customs union.No. Theresa May has said that no British prime minister could agree to different rules applying to different parts of the UK that would separate Northern Ireland constitutionally and economically from the rest of the UK.Yes, the Democratic Unionist Party, the largest part in Northern Ireland whose 10 MPs at Westminster prop up May’s minority Conservative government, and hardline Brexit supporters within her party. Both have said that Northern Ireland cannot be treated any differently from the rest of the UK after it leaves the EU in March 2019 and is opposed to any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.It remains to be seen. In early October 2018, the British government appeared to float the idea of maintaining alignment for the whole of the UK with EU customs rules and that Northern Ireland would specifically remain aligned with EU rules on goods for a period beyond the transition period to December 2020 when current rules continue to apply. Both options would, May says, avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The DUP, however, has repeated its insistence that there should be no checks between Ireland and Britain, which this option would inevitably entail. The party’s leader Arlene Foster has warned that its “red line” - that there could be no Brexit deal that would ide Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom - was “blood red”. The EU has said that the Chequers plan is unworkable as its own negotiators try to “de-dramatise” its own backstop to make it more politically acceptable to the UK government and the DUP.The UK government does not like the idea of a permanent backstop that would keep Northern Ireland tied to the EU customs union and parts of the single market indefinitely, preferring a time-limited backstop instead. This is because of Conservative fears that it could result in the UK overall being tied to the backstop indefinitely and hamper the UK’s future plans to agree trade deals with other countries. The EU believes that any backstop for Northern Ireland should be permanent. This was why both sides failed to agree a deal in crunch negotiations over the weekend ahead of the October summit of EU leaders. The EU said that it would be willing to consider a temporary backstop but that if no trade deal avoiding a hard border has been agreed by the time-limited backstop expires, then the Northern Ireland-only backstop would kick in. The UK rejected this.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Britain and the European Union yesterday abandoned efforts to reach a deal on the Northern Ireland backstop ahead of Wednesday’s EU summit, after they failed to agree on whether it should be time-limited.“I think we are frustrated but we are still pretty calm about that,” Mr Coveney said. “I think everybody would like to have seen clarity this week on the withdrawal agreement. Time is moving on. Ratification mechanisms are going to take time whether that’s in Westminster or in the European parliament.”He said there had been a real effort over the last 10 days by the two negotiating teams to intensify engagement so that they could have a set of recommendations for political leaders this week, but that had not proven possible.“Yesterday the negotiating teams agreed to disengage effectively until after this week’s European Council meeting. That is frustrating and disappointing from an Irish perspective as the country that is more exposed to the fall-out of Brexit than any other EU country, obviously outside of the UK itself.“So for us we want to see an outcome here that settles nerves that allows us to move ahead with a managed sensible Brexit. I still think it’s possible to do that but clearly it’s going to take a bit more time than many people had hoped.” Mr Coveney said the Government was not looking for anything new, but wanted to ensure that commitments made last December, “and in particular last March”, were followed through on. “Last December it was agreed that in the absence of agreeing something better there would be a back stop in place which essentially means that the UK would maintain full alignment with the rules of the customs union and single market, the areas necessary to protect NorthSouth co-operation on an all-island economy and the peace process, or the peace agreement.“Then in March the commitment was very clear that that backstop would be legally operable in terms of text in the withdrawal agreement and it would be there unless and until something better was agreed. “So in other words nobody wants to ever trigger the backstop. But it needs to be there as an insurance mechanism to calm nerves that we’re not going to see physical border infrastructure re-emerging on the island of Ireland.”Mr Coveney said the commitments had been made in writing by the British government, “and what we’re saying is we want no more and no less than the follow through of those commitments. “And that’s what needs to happen. A back stop can’t be time-limited. That’s new. It hasn’t been there before” as a demand, he said. The backstop was supposed to remain “unless and until something better is agreed”.The backstop guarantee agreed in the December by the EU and UK is supposed to lapse when the UK reaches a comprehensive agreement with the EU on their future relationship. Ireland is insistent that, as Mr Coveney put it, such an agreement must be “better” than the backstop, or, in other words, provides sufficient safeguards to ensure that the border can remain frictionless.By insisting instead on trying to time-limit the backstop the UK is indicating clearly that it does not expect any future agreement to reach such a standard.Mr Coveney said he believed Mrs May was “absolutely genuine” in terms of following through on the commitments that she had made, and that she recognised the complexity of politics in Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland.“We expect her to follow through on the commitments that she has already made during these negotiating processes so far.”Meanwhile, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said it would be wrong for “extreme” Brexiteers to be allowed to dictate policy. “It would be a chronic miscalculation and an utter disgrace if the policy of the British government was to be set by the most extreme elements of the Brexiteers and the needs and desires and the idiosyncrasies of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP),” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.And the DUP’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson has said his party believes a no-deal Brexit is “probably inevitable”.“Given the way in which the EU has behaved and the corner they’ve put Theresa May into, there’s no deal which I can see at present which will command a majority in the House of Commons.“So it’s probably inevitable that we will end up with a no deal scenario,” Mr Wilson told the Belfast .Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

While on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves make more than eight times more than the have-nots. Photograph: GettyBulgarians and visitors to their capital Sofia were offered a dazzling show of ancient and modern wealth earlier this year. The country’s national gallery, housed in an elegant former royal palace, displayed 62 glittering treasures dating back to 1,000BC in an exhibition called “The Golden Fleece. The Quest of the Argonauts”.It included 16 pieces that were on show for the first time, having resided in the well-guarded storehouses of the Thrace Foundation, a creation of multi-millionaire businessman Vassil Bojkov. The exhibition brought some cultural sparkle to Bulgaria’s six-month presidency of the EU, and may also have added a little lustre to Bojkov’s shadowy reputation.Established in 2004, the Thrace Foundation says it funds research and improves access to museums and protection of cultural heritage while caring for its founder’s collection of more than 3,000 precious artefacts.Bojkov, whose name is sometimes spelled Vasil Bozhkov, is thought to be Bulgaria’s richest man, with an empire ning construction to gambling operations that he built during his nation’s chaotic and sometimes bloody switch from communism to capitalism in the 1990s. With the Thrace Foundation perhaps the tycoon nicknamed “The Skull” is trying to give something back to the poorest and most unequal country in the EU.Some 11 years after Bulgaria joined the EU – raising hopes for a swift rise in prosperity, a more robust democracy and broader social justice – data from Eurostat in Brussels now make for bleak reading.Bulgaria has the lowest average salary in the EU (€575), the lowest minimum wage (€260) and the smallest average pension (€190).The upshot is that more than 40 per cent of Bulgarians are now at risk of poverty and social exclusion – twice the proportion of Germans who find themselves in the same predicament.In addition, while on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves\u0026nbspmake more than eight times more than the have-nots – without accounting for undeclared wealth.“There are three Bulgarian realities,” says Daniel Kaddik, the Sofia-based director of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation in southeast Europe.“People with an average salary don’t live a good life here, with prices for food, energy and other things that are comparable with elsewhere in Europe.”“Then there is a relatively small middle class who have their own bubble, and work in start-ups or international companies, and live in some areas of Sofia that are comparable with parts of Berlin, for example.”“Then there’s the upper class, which is detached from everything else. They have very fancy cars and private members’ clubs, and there is very often an overlap with shady business.”“I lived in Berlin and I never saw a Maybach,” he adds. “In Sofia I’ve already seen three.”The economy is growing at around 3.5 per cent, but the World Bank says it needs to expand “by at least 4 per cent per year over the next 25 years for Bulgaria to catch up with average EU income levels and thus boost shared prosperity”.Bulgaria leads the EU when it comes to one unpalatable indicator – the prevalence of corruption, and graft is draining the economy, scaring away foreign investors and serving to keep people poor.The country was the EU’s most corrupt nation in the latest Transparency International index, ranking in 71st place alongside South Africa and Vanuatu.Just as alarmingly, an EU survey found last year that only one-quarter of Bulgarians would trust the police to deal with a corruption complaint, and police and customs officers are seen as the public servants most likely to take bribes.The European Parliament estimates that corruption costs Bulgaria about 15 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and graft reaches into every facet of life – from rigged tenders, opaque contracts and kickbacks in multimillion-euro deals to the need for ordinary citizens to pay bribes to smooth their path through the country’s health and education systems and its Byzantine bureaucracy.All these backhanders, big and small, feed a grey economy in Bulgaria that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found last year was equivalent to 29.6 per cent of its GDP, the largest such share in the EU.The result is a debilitating cycle of tax evasion and capital flight, depleted revenues for the government, sub-standard services for the public, and a grinding sense of injustice, grievance and mistrust towards officials and state institutions.An EU survey last year found that when it came to achieving success in life, more than twice as many Bulgarians believe that “knowing the right people” is a bigger factor than having a good education.This feeling that the game is rigged in favour of those with connections, and that poverty is permanent, is writ large in Bulgarian demographics - young people are leaving, couples are having fewer children and the population is falling fast.The UN says Bulgaria is actually the world’s fastest shrinking nation, with its current population of about 7 million people expected to dwindle to 5.4 million by 2050 and 3.9 million by the end of the century.Bulgaria has already lost almost 2 million people from a peak of nearly 9 million in 1989, revealing the massive and long-term impact of the transition from communism to capitalism on eastern Europe - where eight other countries are also expected to suffer a population decline of more than 15 per cent by 2050.The EU’s highest mortality rate, coupled with one of the bloc’s lowest birth rate and the emigration of tens of thousands of workers each year, leave Bulgaria with a headache over how to fund pensions and healthcare for an ageing population.It is no surprise that tens of thousands of Bulgarians seek jobs abroad each year, with Germany, Britain and Spain their favoured destinations, creating a chronic shortage of staff in country’s health service, schools and other major sectors.“There are now places where you don’t have doctor within radius of 50km. You have to bring own toilet paper to the hospital and these kinds of things. It’s a climate that lots of people just don’t want to live in anymore,” says Kaddik.While young professionals are leaving home in search of higher wages, better working conditions and a less corrupt environment, many Bulgarians do not even wait until graduation to start looking abroad for opportunities.About 17 per cent of Bulgarian students went to a foreign university last year, and some of the country’s top universities are now trying to fill hundreds of empty places for the new term.A glimmer of good news for people returning from abroad is that they will probably find the family home waiting. About 84 per cent of Bulgarians own the place where they live, compared to just 53 per cent in Germany.“People were given the apartments where they were living (when communism collapsed) and they are lucky to own their homes, otherwise they simply could not afford their housing,” says Kaddik.“A lot of Bulgarians, especially the elderly, rely on food grown on a little family plot outside the city. The family bond is strong here, and among friends and relatives there is a lot of exchange of small services and helping each other out – but it’s out of necessity because of a lack of good services.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3663948.1539591237!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"meghan markle is pregnant kensington palace confirms","story":"Kensington Palace has announced that Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.

But when her Boko Haram handler escorted her to the target, she recognised faces in the crowd as former neighbours. She hesitated just long enough for police to arrive.A year on, Aisha is among hundreds of ex-Boko Haram captives at a rehabilitation charity in Maiduguri, the dusty city in north-east Nigeria where the country\u0027s jihadist movement sprang up.Recovering from life in a group that treats women as either sex slaves or cannon fodder is not easy: Aisha was so traumatised that she was mute for the first few months, while others are plagued by nightmares, flashbacks and thoughts of suicide.Yet for Fatima Akilu, the NHS-trained psychologist who runs the charity, what is equally disturbing is that not every former hostage regrets their time with the group.In the remote, impoverished villages where Boko Haram has its strongholds, becoming a bush wife is the closest some women ever get to empowerment.A teacher holds a counselling session for boys at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Maiduguri, NigeriaIt isn\u0027t true of all cases, but some of the wives of senior Boko Haram commanders have told me that while they were with the group, they felt empowered for the first time in their lives, said Dr Akilu, a Nigerian Muslim is also a children\u0027s author.They\u0027d often be in command of a harem of women themselves, sometimes hundreds of them, and they\u0027d learn how to use weapons as well.They felt a power they\u0027d never have in their own communities, where they\u0027d usually get married aged 12, and where husbands would then dictate their lives.Counterintuitive though they may be, Dr Akilu\u0027s insights draw on a lifetime studying the murkier side of the human psyche.Educated at boarding school in Tunbridge Wells, she studied psychiatry in Britain and the US before working with young offenders, paedophiles and murderers, including John Hinckley Jr, the man who shot President Ronald Reagan.In 2012, Nigeria\u0027s National Security Agency asked her to devise a local equivalent to Britain\u0027s Prevent counter-extremism project, after reading articles she had written on the role of education in fighting radicalism.How the Nigerian government is fuelling Boko Haram\u0026#039s kidnapping industryAs Director for Behavioural Analysis, she ran prison deradicalisation programs for jailed Boko Haram commanders and their wives, before setting up her own charity, the Neem Foundation, in 2016. It aims to help the tens of thousands of other Nigerians who have spent time in Boko Haram camps, be it voluntarily or as hostages.The group, which has killed an estimated 20,000 people, remains a force to be reckoned with, despite losing much of its turf in the past three years. It still holds around 100 of the 276 schoolgirls snatched from the town of Chibok in 2014, and last month also killed one of three kidnapped local aid workers.But as well as the ongoing military struggle, there is now a hearts and minds challenge to re-integrate those once brainwashed by the group. There are thousands of these people now drifting back into cities and refugee camps,” Dr Akilu said. “They need help, otherwise the problems could last for decades.”At a compound down a backstreet in Maiduguri, the Neem Foundation provides a school for female ex-captives, which is often their first experience of a classroom.\u0026#34Amina\u0026#34, a 17-year-old former hostage of Boko Haram at the Neem Foundation school in Bakassi refugee camp in Maiduguri. She spent 18 months with the groupConducted in English rather than local languages, it is a rebuff to Boko Haram\u0027s mantra that Western education is sinful, although the syllabus goes beyond just the 3Rs. Diversity is an important lesson too, given the inter-tribal chauvinism that Boko Haram exploits.A lot of our pupils are brought up to believe that their own tribe is greatest, be they Hausa, Fulani or Kanuri (the latter the tribe of Boko Haram leader Abubakr Shekau), said Aisha Bukar, the school\u0027s deputy head. By getting them to swap tribes in role-plays, we teach them that Nigeria is a place of many tribes and faiths.Indeed, a few of the program\u0027s clients are unaware that Nigeria even exists as a country, thinking it represents just the wider area around their village.Such limited horizons make them easy prey for Boko Haram’s doctrines, which include the bizarre claim that the world is flat. It also lets the group present itself variously as a world-conquering jihadist force, a glamorous Mafia, and even a local version of the Boy Scouts.There\u0027s a whole range of reasons why people join up, mostly to do with lack of opportunity, said Dr Akilu. For some, it\u0027s the chance to be in a gang and carry a gun. For others, especially adolescents, it\u0027s just a chance to be part of something, to have an adventure. Then there some who join up because Boko Haram gave them money to start a business. It may be just cash to buy a wheelbarrow, but that means the world to people in communities that have nothing.She stresses that despite such blandishments, Boko Haram still has to recruit most of its followers by force. Yet stigma abounds.In a refugee camp where the charity runs another program, Amina Ahmed, 17, who was impregnated by her captors and then miscarried, told how even her own mother blamed her at first. She asked me: \u0027why did you accept?\u0027, and I told her it was because I had no choice, she said, a tear rolling down her cheek. Here I can at least meet other people who\u0027ve had the same problems.A \u0026#34conflict resolution\u0026#34 class at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Bakassi refugee camp in MaiduguriTo date, the Neem Foundation has helped more than 7,000 people affected by Boko Haram, some via a special counselling on wheels service that sends staff out to remoter areas. How successful it will be, only time will tell, although Dr Akilu does already have an endorsement from one important source.During her time working with Boko Haram\u0027s jailed commanders, she persuaded one of the group\u0027s chief imams to back her program, after months of fiery debate about different interpretations of Islam.  He was one of the main leaders who opposed Western education, but halfway through the program, he changed his mind and decided he\u0027d been misleading people. she said. He asked if we could get his children into school, which we did, and now that he\u0027s been freed from prison, he\u0027s gone back to school too.The names of some interviewees have been changed.Newsletter promotion -

The show will reportedly last for up to 110 minutes.Speaking about the news, her father, Mitch, said: “To see her perform again is something special that really can’t be put into words. Our daughter’s music touched the lives of millions of people and it means everything that her legacy will continue in this innovative and groundbreaking way.”The tour will raise money and awareness for the Amy Winehouse Foundation, a charity which educates young people about drug and alcohol misuse. Winehouse died from alcohol poisoning in July 2011. The charity also aids the development of disadvantaged youngsters\u0026nbspthrough music.Winehouse will follow in the footsteps of Roy Orbison and opera singer Maria Callas who are also the subject of such tours from company Base Hologram.Other artists, including Billie Holliday and Tupac, have also been the source of their own hologram shows with the former “performing” 40-minute shows every day at the Hologram USA Theatre in LA.\u0026nbspNew documentary, Amy Winehouse – Back to Black, will be released in November featuring “previously unseen footage” of the singer.

The group has total debts of more than $5.5bn, and its biggest creditor is chief executive Eddie Lampert. The company, which also owns Kmart, also announced plans to close 142 shops by the end of the year, but said all other stores and online and mobile platforms will remain open, offering “a full range of products and services” while the bankruptcy progresses.The group said it had received commitments for $300m debtor-in-possession financing, and is negotiating a further $300m in junior debtor-in-possession funds. OUTLOOK: Chapter 11 is not a bankruptcy panacea, but it does have itsClaire’s files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in USMr Lampert, who is also chairman of Sears Holdings, said: Over the last several years, we have worked hard to transform our business and unlock the value of our assets. “While we have made progress, the plan has yet to deliver the results we have desired, and addressing the company\u0027s immediate liquidity needs has impacted our efforts to become a profitable and more competitive retailer.”Mr Lampert said the Chapter 11 process would give Sears the “flexibility to strengthen its balance sheet, enabling the company to accelerate its strategic transformation, continue right sizing its operating model, and return to profitability”. He added: “Our goal is to achieve a comprehensive restructuring as efficiently as possible, working closely with our creditors and other debtholders, and be better positioned to execute on our strategy and key priorities.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Nick Johannsen\u0026nbspexplains how even urgent action may not be enough to\u0026nbspsave this stately beastClick to followThe IndependentThe fungus causes leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the tree\u0027s crownAs a child growing up in East Anglia, two mighty elm trees were anchors in my world.\u0026nbspEven more feral than my own children, wherever we wandered above the Dedham Vale, two gigantic elm trees signalled home. Without warning these beautiful twins were quickly and ruthlessly cut down by Dutch elm disease. Our welcoming elms became giant, gloomy monoliths, quickly felled, logged and stacked.\u0026nbspDutch elm disease was good for the chainsaw and log stove market. Across Britain there ensued the removal of dead and dying elms on a drastic scale, which created a dramatic diminishment of much loved landscapes. In my own East Anglian clay land, the change was appalling, lanes which were once tunnels of cathedral-like elm trees became scrappy hedges field trees felled and not replaced, woods completely altered, the landscapes changed forever. When my father died nearly 40 years later he had not finished burning the logs he cut and stacked even from our tiny farm.And now for ash, perhaps our most graceful tree, the die seems cast. Ash dieback was first recorded in Britain in 2012, although there is speculation that it\u0026nbspwas here years before. Also known as\u0026nbspHymenoscyphus fraxineus, is a fungal pathogen and a most serious disease of ash trees. It\u0026nbspis stealthier than Dutch elm the death of ash trees is slower: there are moments of apparent recovery, but the eventual decline seems irrecoverable. The estimates are that between 95 per cent and 98 per cent of our ash trees are threatened\u0026nbspthis would seem to be borne out by what we are witnessing in some of the ash dominated woodlands in east Kent.The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreSo great is the threat that common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), the everyday tree of our streets, hedges and woodlands, is now listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.\u0026nbspAsh dieback was first identified in Europe in Poland, in 1992, where it is believed that it arrived on commercially imported ash from East Asia. In its native Asia, the fungus will have co-evolved with the Asian species of ash, on which it therefore has limited\u0026nbspimpact European ash has far less immunity.\u0026nbspThe fungus lives in the leaf litter and has a delicate if peculiar beauty. Thousands of airborne spores are released and can disperse naturally on the wind over tens of kilometres. Continual cycles of infection and reinfection from the leaf litter below produce trees punch drunk with pathogen.\u0026nbspAsh dieback is well described: the effect of the fungus is to block the water transport systems in trees causing leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the crown of the tree. Young trees succumb quickly in older trees the decline can take between six\u0026nbspto 20 years. When the fight is lost, the weakened tree succumbs or is attacked and ultimately killed by another pest or pathogen. The elegant, luxuriant deep green of a late summer venerable ash is reduced to a threadbare tangle of branches and twigs. Desperate new “epicormic”\u0026nbspgrowth emerging from the trunk and branches changes the form and elegance of the tree, once more diminishing our landscapes.An ash tree is a whole ecology: almost 1,000 species use ash as a habitat, including wood mice, liverworts, wrens, blue tits, bats, lichens, fungi and beetles. Bullfinches will eat ash keys in winter when food is scarce. The caterpillars of many kinds of moth feed on ash leaves.\u0026nbspMany lichens are hosted by ash. Lichens are not a parasite and they do not feed off the tree, but use it as a support. According to Oliver Rackham, author of the brilliant book The Ash Tree, the ash is the last refuge of many declining tree lichens, especially those that once grew on elms before they fell victim to loss of habitat through Dutch elm disease. King Alfred’s Cakes (Daldinia concentrica) are specific to ash, and a number of beetles that live only on this fungus are dependent solely on ash for survival.Burrington Combe, Mendips\u0026nbsp(Archie Miles)It is true to say that some ash trees appear to be able to resist or tolerate infection. There is a significant scientific effort going into studying the genetic factors which make this possible so that tolerant ash trees can be bred for the future. Interesting and exciting developments in the science are occurring all of the time and the Living Ash Project reports big steps in collecting, grafting and growing from trees that are identified as being “putatively tolerant to ash dieback”.\u0026nbspDespite the extent of devastation already witnessed elsewhere in Europe and in certain parts of Britain, scientists from the Earlham Institute have found an incredibly limited genetic ersity in the fungus. It would seem that the original infection in European ash may have come from just one or two mushroom-like fruiting bodies.\u0026nbspAccording to the Natural History Museum the ersity of the fungus found across Europe is just an eighth of that found in a single Japanese woodland, so is likely to be a just a tiny fraction of that found across Asia. Imagine what might happen if more of that Asian genetic ersity is brought into Europe.The ash dieback story is bleak, but\u0026nbspfor the beleaguered ash tree\u0026nbspanother\u0026nbspperhaps even more serious\u0026nbspthreat approaches from another invasive species with its own surprising beauty. The Emerald Ash Borer beetle, again a native of Asia, was imported accidentally to North America, thought to have been\u0026nbspon something as apparently innocent as wooden packing material. The impact in North America has been widespread and devastating, killing hundreds of millions of trees since the 1990s.\u0026nbspEmerald Ash Borer has now been found in Russia and is moving westwards and southwards at a rate of around 25 miles a year.The extreme vulnerability of our trees to imported pests and diseases is most dramatically illustrated by the loss of elm and ash. Our trees have such long lives our treescapes take such a long time to recover from these attacks that managing the risk of importing further diseases and pests must be a critical issue for the future.\u0026nbspThere are a wide variety of other tree diseases, which are known threats:\u0026nbspwhile many websites have listings of the top things to do, see or visit, rather sadly the Forestry Commission website has a list of “top tree diseases”.Ash dieback is just one of a list of 14 top diseases, and the borer beetle one of the eight\u0026nbsptop pests.\u0026nbspThe loss of a single beautiful tree can be felt deeply and personally we face the loss of hundreds of millions of trees from Britain’s treescapes, the forces for change are enormous and the response should be in equal measure.Earlier this year the government produced a 25-year plan for the environment, an ambitious initiative that\u0026nbsphas signalled a strong intent to leave the environment in a better state than it was found. The “at a glance”\u0026nbspsummary includes the need to protect our many plants, trees and wildlife species in its very first line. One of the first, most tangible early outputs of the plan is the Tree Health Resilience Strategy. The strategy sets out an integrated approach, which seeks to significantly strengthen biosecurity in\u0026nbspprocurement and practice, deploy the best science and evidence to understand and respond to the risks in an informed way and to increase the extent, connectivity, ersity and condition of our trees and woodlands.The strategy recognises that there is a real need to increase the resistance of our treescapes so that there is no further substantial change or loss, and to support the recovery and adaptation of our landscapes in what will inevitably be a most difficult future.There is a scientific, technical and conservation response to ash dieback and it is vital that there is, but what is the cultural response?\u0026nbspWhat about the little boy who lost his elm trees and is now working to try to conserve and enhance the Kent Downs, one of Britain’s finest and most ash dominated landscapes what is the emotional response?\u0026nbspA fully grown ash can reach a height of 35 metres and can live to 400 years or more. The trees can be easily recognised by their\u0026nbspblack buds and clusters of seeds – which can be a menace for gardeners proud of their lawns. Native to Europe, Africa and Asia, ash is dominant in many parts of the UK and provides the perfect habitat for various wildflowers on the woodland floor, as well as numerous bird species which\u0026nbspnest in its branches. In days gone by the ash was believed to have healing properties – in Viking mythology it was known as the ‘tree of life’.The hills and valleys of this enchanting quarter of Kent are punctuated by ash, our most common tree. Ash is intrinsic to the place, it is in the names of the villages, towns and woodlands one of the most affected woods has two names, Asholt Wood and Ashley Wood a single remarkable ash tree is marked on the Ordnance Survey map for Ashford.\u0026nbspWe expect that we will lose almost all of our ash trees and so we feel that it is vital that we record and celebrate what we have before it might be lost. We want to do this in extraordinary and enduring ways so that we connect more with our trees and treescapes and provide a record for the future. For elm, Gerald Wilkinson wrote Epitaph for The Elm. Hastily put together and almost too late to record fine elm trees in the landscape, it is a saddening record.\u0026nbspOur idea is to salute the tree, as well as mark the loss.\u0026nbspThe Ash Project, which is funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council of England, combines a major new sculptural commission by internationally recognised artists Ackroyd \u0026amp Harvey with a wide-ranging programme of walks, talks and exhibitions.\u0026nbspWe have created a temporary archive that records both the extraordinary utility of ash and celebrates ordinary ash objects that we all might know.The Ash Archive involves\u0026nbspexisting objects and art works and new commissions across a range of art forms, and the public is invited to add to a growing, collectively generated collection. Our approach has been to collaborate across conservation and scientific research work to develop new languages with this massive environmental change. It is our hope that, through the Ash Project, we will preserve our memories of the tree for the generations who will live with the loss.The cultural celebration is also supported by a collaboration with the Woodland Trust and a number of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in which ash is dominant, to work with author Archie Miles to publish a monograph. Titled Ash, this new publication pays tribute to the ash tree in all of its glorious manifestations across the landscapes of the UK. The book, on sale now,\u0026nbspis a loving homage to the ash tree.On a practical basis we are working with a wide variety of organisations to support a Kent-wide plan for landscape restoration. We have produced guidance for landowners in order to plan wide scale recovery and to ensure we retain much of the bioersity that ash supports, but surely more must be done across the country to prevent further landscape and environmental loss.Campaign plants trees every time Trump tweets about climate changeHere’s why we’re planting trees in northern SyriaCouncil ‘reliant on police’ to carry out tree-felling workAs the summer wanes the impact of ash dieback is at its greatest. At this time of year in Kent we see the ink-like blackening of the leaves of affected trees, with leaf fall occurring as much as a month or two earlier than it should, bringing the bleakness of winter to the landscape all too soon.It is in this season that we have chosen to present Ash to Ash\u0026nbsp– a monumental art work by Ackroyd\u0026nbsp\u0026amp\u0026nbspHarvey. Standing high on the scarp of the Kent Downs, two giant monoliths stand proud, almost defiant. One the bright white of newly cut ash wood, the other charred and blackened like the inky leaves of an affected tree. These extraordinary pieces, made from ash dieback stricken trees, are pierced by more than 10,000 arrows, handmade from coppiced ash. They act as marker trees, on the edge of the North Downs Way.\u0026nbspOverlooking a landscape already damaged by ash dieback, they will be a striking reminder of all that we stand to lose. Unlike the giant elm monoliths of my childhood, this extraordinary artwork both memorialises and celebrates the ash.\u0026nbspIn Kent and East Anglia the impact of ash dieback is already, in places, devastating.\u0026nbspThis seems likely to be the story across the country over the next 10 to 15 years.Ash is perhaps most closely associated with some of our most valued landscapes, the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks. Places such as\u0026nbspthe Cotswolds, Chilterns, High Weald, Lake District, Dorset, Yorkshire Dales, White Peak and Snowdonia are, in part, defined by their relationship with the ash tree, there is a great need to document and celebrate these landscapes also.We plan to take the work\u0026nbspwe have started in Kent to a national platform, to collaborate across Britain with landscape managers, artists, scientists and ecologists to ensure we mark and honour the graceful Venus of the woods, the tree of life, before it is lost to us.Nick\u0026nbspJohannsen\u0026nbspis director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Unit. The Ash Project was conceived and is managed by the unit.

Andrew Grice\u0026nbspasks whether the dominance of big tech is now imperilling our democratic system and considers what can be done about itClick to followThe IndependentAllegations of state-sponsored interference in foreign elections have changed the gameWhen Theresa May called a surprise election last year Labour rushed out a manifesto which proved remarkably popular. There was, however, a hole at its heart. Plans to renationalise the rail, water and parts of the energy industry had a backward-looking feel, and Labour had nothing to say about the new oligopolies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Netflix.That is one reason why Jeremy Corbyn was keen to take on the digital giants in his speech to the Edinburgh Television Festival in August, proposing that the BBC receive a “digital licence fee” funded by a tax on tech companies or internet service providers. The Labour leader, who said his party faces “greater hostility from\u0026nbspthe mainstream media than we’ve probably ever had before”, inevitably faced media criticism for some of his ideas – not least in respect of a proposed expansion of\u0026nbsp“public service journalism”, funded by tech firms, which sceptics doubted would be free from political interference.But Corbyn’s proposals on the tech multinationals were well timed and reflect a changing public and political mood. In July, Facebook was fined the maximum £500,000 by the UK Information Commissioner after its data was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Meanwhile, Vote Leave was fined £61,000 and referred to the police after the Electoral Commission ruled that it exceeded its £7m spending limit by channelling £675,000 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. It must be added that it denies the claim.I’m leaving Facebook – and it’s not because of Cambridge AnalyticaIn the same month, the cross-party Digital,\u0026nbspCulture, Media and Sport Select Committee produced a devastating critique of the new media landscape. Damian Collins, its Tory chair, warned that democracy itself is at risk. The committee proposed that social media sites be held responsible for interference in elections by malicious actors and recommended a “clear legal liability” for tech companies which failed to act against harmful and illegal content.For the past 36 years, I’ve had a ringside seat at the often bruising battles between politicians and the media\u0026nbspthe last 20 of them while working for The Independent. When I became a Westminster-based journalist in 1982, the remnants of a much more deferential age were still evident. The questions we asked were a little more probing than the “is there anything you’d like to say today, prime minister?” style of interrogation that was evident in the 1950s, when television news was launched. But the male-dominated club of parliamentary lobby journalists I joined was unnecessarily secretive. “Maintain the mystique,” one veteran political editor told me.It was an open secret that the Downing Street press secretary – then Bernard Ingham for Margaret Thatcher – briefed the lobby daily. But we were not allowed to quote Number 10 such briefings had to be attributed to “Whitehall sources”. The archaic system would eventually change, with The Independent among those championing reform after its launch in 1986.The pro-Conservative majority among the newspapers was always thereThe lobby has many critics. Yet if it was scrapped today, it would re-emerge in a different guise tomorrow politicians and the media need each other, and they need to talk, however strained the relationship. The lobby is not perfect, and still too dominated by men. But some criticism is overdone. Conspiracy theorists on the left recently claimed the existence of a Press Gallery WhatsApp group showed how the lobby pack agrees the line to take on stories. At the time, the group was discussing smelly towels left in the showers and the price of crisps in our canteen.Much is also made of anonymous briefings by politicians and their advisers. But if these were abolished and all statements were on the record, many would be so bland as to be worthless. It is the journalist’s job to find out what’s going on people are more willing to talk without having their names attached to a quote: such discussions will always take place. Jeremy Corbyn’s team often relies on such briefings. Do spin doctors abuse this system and lie? Occasionally, but less than you might think journalists have long memories and won’t believe them next time if they get caught.The inevitable “poacher versus gamekeeper” relationship between media and politicians has changed markedly during my time at Westminster – and it’s changed for the worse, with both sides being to blame. The pro-Conservative majority among the newspapers was always there. When I joined the lobby, old hands told me: “Right-wing journalists bend over backwards to be fair to the Conservative Party. And left-wing journalists bend over backwards to be fair to… the Conservative Party as well!”What’s shifted is that some national newspapers have crossed a line, becoming players on the political stage rather than impartial analysts. The iding line between news and comment has become blurred, and in some cases invisible. It was as if the papers, hit by declining circulations – which fell from a combined 14.8 million in 1983 to 5.9 million last year – decided to shout louder to grab people’s attention. The launch from 1989 of the 24-hour television news channels – first Sky, then a BBC offering – meant the papers were no longer first with the news, and sometimes became more focused on infotainment than information.The growing influence of TV and the decline of newspapers was made clear when the UK belatedly held its first televised election debates between party leaders at the 2010 general election. The debates dominated press coverage as soon as one debate ended, the papers previewed the next. Nevertheless, the political spin doctors continue to fret 247 about what the papers say, because they often still set the broadcasters’ agenda.Some elements of the press, particularly on the right, have given news an opinionated twist, and has become less reliable as a result. There’s no doubt that hostile, often inaccurate, coverage of the European Union – and underreporting about the benefits of membership – played a critical role in the decision to hold the 2016 referendum and in the result.By then (if not before), some papers had crossed a line between healthy scepticism about politics and its practitioners to unhealthy cynicism. In 2009, The Daily  was absolutely right to expose abuses of the MPs’ expenses system but there has been a feeding frenzy ever since: a misleading presumption that MPs are in it for themselves. In my view, this has gone too far, fuelling in turn public cynicism and a lack of trust in politicians – though it’s also true to say they contributed to this by trying to spin their way out of troubles they had made themselves.At the 1992 election, Neil Kinnock, a modernising Labour leader, faced a barrage of highly personal abuse and criticism in the Tory tabloids. The Sun’s front page on polling day declared that if Kinnock won, “will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights?” The Sun claimed to have “won it” when the Conservatives were re-elected but the truth was that Rupert Murdoch liked to back the winner (and be seen to have done so) to maximise his influence.Scarred by Kinnock’s treatment, Tony Blair made a sea change when he became Labour leader two years later. He told me: “I’m not going to let them do to me what they did to Neil. Never again.” In Blair’s view, that meant supping with the devil. He flew halfway round the world to address a conference held by Murdoch in Australia. Blair once said: “It is better to ride the back of a tiger than let it rip your throat out.”The cosying up was accompanied by a much more aggressive response to negative media reports about Labour – there would be a “rapid rebuttal” or even “pre-buttal” when the party got wind of a potentially damaging story. New Labour spin doctors put pressure on journalists, with threats such as “you’ll never get another interview or exclusive if you write this” they complained behind reporters’ backs to their editor, occasionally even demanding their removal.\u0026nbspThey doled out exclusive stories to favoured journalists or papers, though there was nothing new in that.Blair’s “hug them close” strategy worked, at least in opposition. The Sun, the country’s biggest selling paper, came out for Labour at the 1997 election (which it was bound to win in any event). In government though, New Labour became too eager to please its media enemies-turned-friends. Lance Price, who was deputy to Alastair Campbell, Blair’s communications director, said “no major decision could be taken by the government without first assessing the reaction of three people”:\u0026nbspGordon Brown, the chancellor John Prescott, the deputy prime minister and Murdoch.Spin had its limitations of course. Headline-grabbing works in opposition, when the media is your main weapon but in power, New Labour discovered that headlines were no substitute for policy or action. Spin would also, in the end, contribute to Blair’s demise and help to tarnish his legacy. In 2003, he discovered that you cannot spin the case for war, when it is based on non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.As papers like The Sun tired of Blair and reverted to type, he launched an attack on the “feral beasts” of the media in one of his last speeches as prime minister. I sat in the front row, appalled that he bizarrely singled out The Independent for criticism when his real target was the Daily Mail he was still too frightened of its power to say so.David Cameron copied the New Labour playbook when he began modernising the Conservatives on becoming their leader in 2005. Mirroring Blair’s trip to Australia, Cameron flew to the Google Zeitgeist conference in San Francisco in 2007, symbolically paying homage to the new power in the media world.\u0026nbspCameron, who called Blair “the master”, faithfully adopted his top-down, centralised approach to media management, and imported it into government in 2010. The cosy relationship between leading figures in the government and media was highlighted again during the Leveson inquiry after the phone-hacking scandal.Politics is certainly more polarised that I have ever known...When Theresa May succeeded Cameron after his ill-fated EU referendum in 2016 she set out to do everything differently. That included moving away from a rigid day-to-day “grid” of centrally controlled initiatives designed to allow the government to set the agenda. May tried to curb headline-grabbing stunts, and focus on fewer, bigger statements. It was an honest attempt to combat spin, but didn’t work in a digital age when the battle between government and media (and between parties, and even between factions within parties) had become ever faster and more frenetic. However, it is doubtful whether any administration could dictate the agenda while Brexit eclipses everything.May’s disastrous snap election last year would prove a watershed for the press. Right-wing papers reprised their 1992 treatment of Kinnock to target Corbyn, but this time – refreshingly – it didn’t work. In the age of the insurgent, already exploited by Trump and the Brexiteers, social media helped Corbyn bypass the mainstream media (the hated “MSM” in Corbynland). Friends sharing pro-Labour stories on Facebook and other social platforms proved a powerful weapon. Labour’s machine outgunned the Tories, diluting the impact of the right-leaning press.However, it remains to be seen whether the old media has really been replaced by new media which, despite the early optimism about “digital democracy” during Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns, seems actually to undermine rather than enhance democracy. In those days of hope, I didn’t imagine Trump tweeting from the White House at 5am about the “fake news media” and journalists who are “the enemy of the people”.Politics is certainly more polarised that I have ever known – no coincidence when filter bubbles create echo chambers that reinforce our own views. The abuse hurled around on Twitter, between fellow party members as well as opponents, is nasty, often misogynistic and sometimes racist. It scars our politics.At the 2017 election, parties spent more than 40 per cent of their advertising budgets online. During the EU referendum, Vote Leave devoted 98 per cent of its ad spend to digital, much on highly targeted “dark” ads which no one but the recipients could see. It ran a last-minute blitz claiming falsely: “Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU. Our schools and hospitals already can’t cope!”The social media ads used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever inventedThe tech giants have been slow to put their house in order, and politicians slow to force them. While claiming to be platforms rather than publishers, they have often paid little tax in countries where they made vast profits. They have demolished the economic model of newspapers by gobbling up much of their advertising revenue. Some 300 local papers have closed in the UK in the past 10 years, undermining democracy at local levePoliticians want to sound modern and offer a vision of the future. But Tom Baldwin, a former political journalist who was Ed Miliband’s communications director, believes they do not understand the new technology and are afraid to regulate the new giants roaming the media landscape. In a revealing and thoughtful new book covering politics on both sides of the Atlantic, Ctrl Alt Delete, published by Hurst, Baldwin argues that the new information age “has unpicked truth and hollowed out space for a virulent new strain of populism to spread like a contagion across all forms of media”. He says: “The social media ads that were used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever invented.”What, then, needs to be done? The government plans to require an imprint showing the identity of those running digital ads, and a new offence of intimidating parliamentary candidates and party campaigners. But it will need to go much further to ensure a system of\u0026nbspelectoral law brought in for an analogue era is fit for a fast-evolving digital age.Created with Sketch.11 useful Facebook features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Clean up your News FeedMost of us are Facebook friends with some people we don’t actually care about, and there are several ways to keep their updates off your News Feed.

They could be funded by a levy on the tech giants. There should be a statutory code of practice covering the use of personal data by political campaigns. All political ads should be published in some sort of central register so that everyone can see them. In election periods, ads should be limited to registered campaigns, following evidence of Russian interference in the last US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.There is rising political support for a ban on online political ads, to bring the internet into line with broadcast media. It extends from Baldwin on the left to William Hague, the former Tory leader, on the right. This would help to stop those with the deepest pockets enjoying an unfair advantage, but would not prevent videos being shared.For a government consumed by Brexit, such reforms might not look like a priority.

The worst thing we have to worry about is repetitive strain syndrome and drinking too much coffee. But there is a heroic hardcore who are willing to put themselves in the way of harm to tell the story.Writing about certain presidents and princes can be bad for your health. In Michael Scott Moore’s case, it was pirates. He was doing research into pirates, so like any decent reporter worth his salt he thought he should go and interview one. What happened next you can read about in his new book, The Desert and the Sea. The clue is in the subtitle: 977 Days Captive on the Somali Pirate Coast.What image springs to mind when you think of pirates? Johnny Depp? An eye-patch? A cutlass? For me, it’s more an adjective – “swashbuckling”. Criminals of the high seas, of course, but romantic daredevils, skilled swordsmen, daring nomadic outsiders, surely. Michael Scott Moore has finally put paid to any lingering remnants of the myth by way of being kidnapped by them and held hostage for nearly three years, driven to the brink of madness, malaria and suicide by “a stupid and self-aggrandising pirate society, a suicidal culture in which gunshots rang in the street and gunmen were winners”.UK investigates reports of looting of sunken WW2 shipsMoore was a surfer – and author of Sweetness and Blood, a history of American expansionism after the Second World War, seen through the turquoise lens of surfing –\u0026nbspwho naturally felt a certain rapport with the men who make their living off the sea. And he felt that piracy was not exactly unknown in American history. “North America,” Moore writes, “had evolved from an underdeveloped haven for pirates to an antipirate world power within three generations.”Hobyo (Courtesy of Michael Scott Moore)I saw him before he left for Somalia – hale and hearty – and I went to see him again recently, in a cafe in West Village, New York, several years later, after he got back, now 49, looking like a war veteran, wounded, skinnier, traumatised, but a survivor. Older and wiser. He had planned to write a book about Somali pirates that would be pure reportage, “but,” he says, “it became more personal from the moment I got kidnapped”.\u0026nbspWhen you’re held hostage your entire life up to that moment keeps replaying itself in your head. His father, Bert Moore, was an aerospace engineer and alcoholic who committed suicide when Michael was aged 12. His mother told him it was a heart attack. He only found out what really happened 30 years later when he asked for a copy of the death certificate that read: “Gunshot\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspleft chest”. He had been kicked out of the family home in the suburbs of Los Angeles by Mrs Moore. After a year of trying to get sober he shot himself. Mother and son went to live in Redondo Beach, where he started surfing.abc)When his first marriage fell apart, Mike left his old southern Californian life behind and set up in Berlin. Somehow he ended up writing about pirate activities for Spiegel Online International and attended the trial of 10 pirates in Hamburg, in 2011. It was the first trial of pirates on German soil for 400 years. They had been arrested after a gun battle with Dutch commandos while trying to hijack a German ship.“I was as full of pirate romance as the next American kid” says Moore. He knew that\u0026nbspPirates of the Caribbean was pure Hollywood. But still he wanted to find out what they were really like. Moore had been to the Horn of Africa before –\u0026nbspon a counter-piracy vessel, a Turkish warship.But in January 2012, supported by a couple of magazines and a grant from the Pulitzer Centre\u0026nbspon Crisis Reporting, he set off again, without a warship this time. To be on the safe side he had tried to get kidnap insurance and been turned down. But he wasn’t naive. He knew he was in “a country where no one could save me if things went wrong”. He had security. “Good security”, as he describes it. The problem was that at the crucial moment they “disappeared”. They sold him out. He was paying them well, but the pirates were paying them more. And they were part of the same clan. “That particular clan was supposed to be hosting and protecting me,” he says with an ironic grin.He interviewed a pirate called Mustaf in a flyblown restaurant in Hobyo where he had to pay $620 for lunch. He left a filmmaker colleague at the airport and was being driven back into town along “Pirate Road” when his car was stopped by a dozen men bristling with automatic weapons. He was beaten, his glasses were broken, and he was bundled into the pirate vehicle of choice, a Toyota Land Cruiser.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Israeli soldiers hurl tear gas grenades during clashes following Israeli order to shut down the al-Lubbanal-Sawiyeh school near the west bank city of Nablus, 15 October 2018.

A gunman opened fire at a video game tournament killing multiple people and then fatally shooting himself in a rampage that wounded several othersOne of the pirates had the cheek to say to him, as if it was all his fault, “You have made a mistake.”\u0026nbspIt is a phrase that haunts him even to this day. For a long while in captivity, he felt the pirates were right about that: “I was a tall, white man hoping to make friends with pirates. Crazy.”\u0026nbspBeing a writer meant that he was worth something. “I have seen you on the internet,” said one of his captors. “You are famous.”\u0026nbspHe denied it. Then they fished out a picture of him that had appeared in the New York Times. I had even contributed in a small way to adding to the price on his head by writing an enthusiastic review of his surfing book in that newspaper. The asking price was $20m. If only I’d slated his book it might have brought the price down by a few million. His friends soon learned he had been kidnapped but we were warned not to write anything. Every time his name was mentioned on the BBC his price went up again.He was regularly beaten, and threatened with torture, or being handed over to al-Shabaab, but one of the worst things about being held in captivity is not having anything to read. One of the highlights of his first few months was piecing together fragments of The Gulf News\u0026nbspwhich had been wrapping up samosas. Taken to a ship a mile offshore, the Naham 3 – a highjacked fishing vessel – he was given a Bible by one of his fellow hostages. A lapsed Catholic, he read it twice from cover to cover, having to squint all the while, but finding consolation in “the gritty survival ethic” of the Old Testament. He decided he was not so keen on crucifixion as such.There were a lot of guards on the ship, and a fair few sharks in the water too. And without glasses he could barely make out where he was going. But in the end he leapt off the ship in a bid for freedom. He didn’t make it and spent the next three\u0026nbspweeks chained up in solitary confinement. I read a story online about how he had been shot while trying to escape. This turned out to be a myth put about by the pirates themselves, with a notion of speeding up delivery of the ransom.Around this time Moore devoutly wished he had become an astronaut – or anything – rather than a writer. As a kid, his bedroom had been decorated with astronaut wallpaper, peppered with rockets and moons and stars. Now marooned on board a very terrestrial ship, he was tormented by dreams and rumours of a rescue that never came. But there was still one option available to him. He could try and shoot his way out. It would be the heroic thing to do. But it would also be stupid. The guards had a habit of leaving their Kalashnikovs lying about. There was zero chance of getting away but he could go out in a blaze of glory and bullets, and maybe take a pirate or two down with him. “I was angry enough to pick up a Kalashnikov,” he says.Rolly Tambara, who were held in captivity together (Seychelles Nation)The thing that stopped him was the memory of his father’s suicide. His logic was that he didn’t want his mother to have to bear witness to both the men in her life self-destructing. His mother becomes one of the heroes of the book. German in origin, Marlis was still playing tennis and golf, and was due to have lunch at a Mexican restaurant when five men in suits (unheard of in Redondo Beach) turned up at her door. Schooled by the FBI, she had to conduct ransom negotiations herself over the phone, driving the price down from $20m\u0026nbspto $8m, then down to $5m, and finally $1.5m. In the end she recruited a mercenary to deliver $700,000, which she\u0026nbspmanaged to cobble together from different sources, friends, family and Der Spiegel.“I’m still angry,” Michael says, “about losing more than two years of my life.” But he had to rein in his anger if he wanted to live. When he explained he needed a doctor for his broken wrist the trigger-happy guard said to him, “You mean it was broken in this operation.” He was tempted to reply, “No motherf***er, I’m in the habit of walking around Somalia with a broken wrist.” “Yes” is how he chooses – rather carefully – to phrase it.He developed friendships with the other hostages – Chinese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Filipinos –and he came around to liking some of the guards. But he was never tempted by Stockholm syndrome: “I went through a long period of wanting to kill them.” Notably one guy by the name of Ali.Werne)Sometimes your reading can save your life. In Moore’s case it was Epictetus, the great stoic philosopher. Stoicism says that you can’t do a lot about your fate, but you can control your attitude towards it. Epictetus asks the question, what do you do if your servant drops your favourite vase and it smashes into a thousand pieces? Do you lash out and whip the servant, or do you say – which is what he recommends – “the vase has been restored”. Moore grits his teeth and develops a sense of humour about his predicament. “Not that I laughed every day.”\u0026nbspWhen he was staring down the barrel of a gun, quite literally, he learned to sit and accept the prospect of a sudden death. “I had to train my mind for actual non-existence.”As well as ancient Greek philosophers, a collection of Tom and Jerry cartoons definitely helps. As does news, on a short-wave radio, of the World Cup in Brazil in 2014, when Germany thrashed Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final.\u0026nbspThere is an ironic twist in Moore’s story, when most of the people who tormented him for so long are annihilated, in a way he could never have anticipated, but which reflects what he writes about the rise of “factionalism and violent opportunism”. One further irony:\u0026nbspwhen he gets free he even has one of his former captors becoming a Facebook “friend”.Disney removes bride auction scene on ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ ride‘Porch pirates’ steal 4-year-old boy’s supply of life-saving medicineMaybe he could have made it as an astronaut, but he is the most persistent and unstoppable of writers. He simply stole a pen and paper from the pirates and wrote about his experiences, like a Solzhenitsyn of the Somali gulag. But these samizdats never see the light of day. When his guards read their own names they confiscate his notebooks, again and again. Finally he realises his only way out is fiction. He sets his novel in southern California, not in Somalia. About a quixotic innocent who is kidnapped by bad guys. It was partly allegory, to remind him of what happened, but now it’s in danger of becoming his next book.For Michael Scott Moore, writing is therapy, a way of retaining sanity. “To put painful events into a certain order, I had to find a way through it. The easiest thing was to set down what happened.”I asked him what he missed most during his 977 days. “I’m not sure there was any one thing. Beer? Fresh fruit? Above all my family and friends. Everything about my old life, good and bad,” he said. “I was just grateful to be alive in the end.”There is almost a note of sadness or nostalgia in his voice when he says that the traditional Somali pirate is now virtually extinct. “The business model has evolved. They’ve shifted into arms and human trafficking. Piracy has become too dangerous.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’, and\u0026nbspteaches at the University of Cambridge‘The Desert and the Sea:\u0026nbsp977 Days Captive on the Somali Pirate Coast’, by Michael Scott Moore, is published by Harper CollinsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And it is all part of the company\u0027s plan to finally turn the huge amount of hype around its phones into a similarly huge number of sales.But the new carrier announcements are also actually an extension of the work the company has already done in building its brand and encouraging people to recommend its phones, the company says. And it is adamant it will not come at the cost of the things that have made the phones so beloved, such as the engagement with its community that decides everything including what the phones look like and what features are added to them.OnePlus 6T: Release date announced for super-charged AndroidWe’re a digital brand first, and that means word of mouth is very important – it’s the number one way new users hear about us, Carl Pei, co-founder and head of brand of OnePlus, tells The Independent\u0026nbspin an exclusive interview. You may think that this is counter-intuitive, but partners like EE and Vodafone are actually an extension of our online strategy.Our users advocate us to their friends and family, and having high-street visibility means that now people can try our device in-store. The brand endorsement and support that these prestigious carriers and retailers have given us can also be taken as a compliment.Pei\u0026nbspsays that the new shot at the mainstream won\u0027t change the way the products are designed and made. It will only expand the number of people who are able to contribute towards new ideas and feed back on old ones, he says, allowing OnePlus to keep that approach even while it expands the number of people who are a part of it.As we grow, we’ll get more feedback and pressure about our design choices –\u0026nbspwe only add features which can improve the experience, not because they’re in fashion, he says.\u0026nbspIt’s important to understand what people really need.The UK OnePlus forum\u0026nbspis already one of the most engaged of any country in the world, with 1.5 million active users. More than 1,000 Britons turned up to see the reveal of the\u0026nbspOnePlus\u0026nbsp6, its latest phone, and it would go on to sell more than a million of those devices.OnePlus 5 smartphone at a OnePlus pop-up store at the Bikini Berlin shopping mall on June 21, 2017 in Berlin, Germany (Sean GallupGetty Images)OnePlus has inspired fanatical devotion in its customers, who queue up for the phones and flock to the launch events. Some of that devotion was inspired precisely because the phones have been so complicated to buy: at the beginning, they could only be got through an invitation system that meant users felt they had been allowed access to club, and that exclusivity encouraged loyalty.But Pei\u0026nbspis clear that OnePlus doesn\u0027t intend to give up on that customer – or fan –\u0026nbsprelationship, even if there are many more customers that are a part of it.We’ve always been very focused on our users and we’ll have to work hard to ensure current users feel valued, and new users are welcomed. It’s easy for brands to forget where they’ve come from – we’ve learned a lot from others in the industry, both in success and failure, he says.We’re committed to keeping our core and staying grounded, while expanding our business. The ultimate driver of people wanting to support you is having a great product, and that’s followed by having great service. The product attracts you at first, but it’s long-term service which will keep you loyal. Too many businesses are focused on bringing in new users.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But when they do so they will most likely see the library of the country they are in, as happens if Britons travel outside of the European Union now.“UK Netflix subscribers are able to access Netflix everywhere in the world Netflix is available and will continue to do so once the UK leaves the EU,” a Netflix spokesperson said. The company said that “local catalogues vary due to licensing and local tastes”, but pointed out its original shows are available everywhere.The new papers also make clear that the same regulations would apply to geo-blocking regulation. That ensures that people can buy from online services across the continent, without being punished for doing so from another country.“Following repeal of the Geo-Blocking Regulation in the UK, traders from the UK, EU and third countries would not be prohibited from discriminating between EU customers and UK customers,” the papers say.“For instance a UK trader would be able to offer different terms to a UK customer compared to a French customer.”Companies based in the UK and selling products and services in the EU\u0026nbspwill still have to comply with the regulation, to ensure that they don’t discriminate between people in different countries within Europe.The new geo-blocking rules go into effect in December 2018, meaning that they will apply to UK citizens for about\u0026nbspthree months before a possible no-deal Brexit in March 2019.The paper covering ‘Geo-blocking of online content if there’s no Brexit deal’ and another covering portability of content\u0026nbspis one of a range of papers released in the latest set of documents from the UK government. They also include new documents showing Britain could no longer benefit from deals that represent a significant portion of UK trade and that train journeys into and out of the EU could be disrupted.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The statistics back up what our research has been showing for years: that buses are in crisis.”Mr Shirley urged the government to use its upcoming budget to reverse the “trend of cutting support” for buses.“They are vital for the economy and the environment but year-on-year, people – especially in rural areas – are losing their bus service, making it difficult to access jobs, education and other essential public services.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Prime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

The Independent\u0027s Europe Correspondent Jon Stone explains the latest Brussels\u0026nbsprollercoasterClick to followIndy PoliticsWhat just happened? All weekend, news trickling out of Brexit talks became more and more positive. By Sunday lunchtime EU diplomats were certain a deal had been agreed. Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, headed out to Brussels to confirm it all – or so we thought.Then the Brexit rollercoaster hit yet another big-dipper: after a shorter-than expected meeting between Raab and Michel Barnier, it was all off again, and we were, in the words of one official “back to square one”.Anyone following these talks will have become accustomed to twists and turns, but with this week’s European Council summit looming – the “moment of truth” –\u0026nbsp the stakes are higher than ever. The Irish border, and the so-called “backstop” is the sticking point.A deal of sorts appears to have been agreed: The Independent understands that an agreement at a technical level – between officials – was struck. But agreement at a political level is a different question entirely.\u0026nbspTalks are shrouded in secrecy, and leaks from them are prone to spin. But as far as we can tell EU appears to have agreed to the UK plan that would, with some caveats, keep the whole UK inside the customs union to prevent any borders around Northern Irleand – either between it and Great Britain, or it and Northern Ireland.This had been proposed by the UK to placate the DUP – who want no difference in treatment between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and who say they would sink any deal that did. Most people believe they’re single-minded enough to carry through on their threat.But sources say Brussels is sceptical that this plan would work – and so are insisting on what has been dubbed “the backstop to the backstop”. The thinking here goes that if the UK’s political instability means that if trade talks collapse and the UK has second thoughts about being tied to the EU customs union, the original EU plan to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would step up.The Prime Minister is probably cursing herself for calling last year’s electionBut this was unacceptable to the British government, who don’t think they could get even this past the DUP.There is a fundamental tension for the UK government which restricts their freedom to compromise in talks: lean towards a customs union for the whole UK to placate the DUP, and Tory eurosceptics get angry because they want to be outside the customs union. But lean too hard the other way, and make the backstop more specific to Northern Ireland, and the DUP withdraw their votes.With a razor-thin majority in the Commons the Government can’t really afford to lose either. Ultimately it is now Parliament, and what the Government can get through, that is the biggest obstacle to signing a deal.\u0026nbspSo what happens next? There are no more talks between officials until the European Council summit later this week, where leaders will discuss their response. The negotiations teams – who both speak very highly of each other – clearly believe they have gone as far as they can within the instructions they have been given by their respectively political leaderships.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Others fear that this is wishful thinking and that a no-deal may now be more likely than not. \u0026nbspEither way, with the composition of the House of Commons the main obstacle to a deal, the Prime Minister is probably cursing herself for calling last year’s election, blowing her majority, and putting the DUP in the driving seatThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is something the House of Commons has already rejected and is unacceptable to the prime minister.Speculation has been rife about the international development secretary Penny Mordaunt\u0027s future in the cabinet - she appeared to sidestep questions this morning, urging colleagues to calm down.\u0026nbspAlso arriving in Brussels, Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, said it was\u0026nbspfrustrating and disappointing that negotiators had disengaged but insisted that the temporary border backstop wanted by the UK was a non-starter.\u0026nbspHe said that Dublin and the EU simply wanted Theresa May to follow through with agreements already made in March and December.\u0026nbspA backstop can\u0027t be time-limited.That is new, it hasn\u0027t been there before.

The result in Bavaria is a vote against the grand coalition in Berlin.The Greens offered voters a more liberal approach to migration in contrast to the\u0026nbspCSU, and the party linked environmental conservation to traditional German culture during campaigning. \u0026nbspAngela Merkel should become the president of the European CommissionThe CSU\u0026nbsphas governed Bavaria, a prosperous economic\u0026nbsppowerhouse home to 13 million people, and has previously held an absolute majority in the state parliament for all but five of the past 56 years.\u0026nbspPower struggles in the national government have weighed on the party, which is traditionally more conservative than Ms Merkel\u0027s Christian Democratic Union.\u0026nbspThe two parties have clashed on migration, after the CSU\u0026nbsptook a hard line on the issue.\u0026nbspMerkel keeps government together after emergency talks on migrationOf course this isn\u0027t an easy day for the CSU, Bavaria\u0027s\u0026nbspgovernor, Markus Soeder, told supporters in Munich, adding that the party accepted the painful result with humility.It\u0027s not so easy to uncouple yourself from the national trend completely, he added, implying that the situation in Berlin had helped to erode the party\u0027s support.\u0026nbspHorst Seehofer, the CSU leader who is also Germany\u0027s interior minister, has often been involved in internal coalition squabbling in the capital.\u0026nbspMr Seehofer has clashed repeatedly\u0026nbspwith Ms Merkel about migration since 2015, when he attacked\u0026nbspher decision to leave Germany\u0027s borders open as refugees crossed the Balkans.In June the two leaders argued over whether to turn back small numbers of asylum-seekers at the German-Austrian border, briefly threatening to bring down the national government.The\u0026nbspCSU\u0026nbspwill now need to form a coalition to govern\u0026nbsp Bavaria and Mr Soeder\u0026nbspsaid his preference was for a centre-right alliance.German youths stab journalist then perform Hitler saluteThe Greens are traditionally bitter opponents of the CSU, though they too remain a possible coalition partner.\u0026nbspPolls indicate the CSU\u0026nbspand CDU\u0026nbspare set for further setbacks in two weeks in an election in the western state of Hesse, where\u0026nbspAfD\u0026nbspand the Greens are set for further gains.The state is ruled by Merkel\u0027s\u0026nbspCDU\u0026nbspin coalition with the Greens, and a slump in support for the conservatives there would almost certainly further weaken her authority.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

My parents didn\u0027t give us titles, so we\u0027ve been able to have a slightly more normal upbringing. As soon as you\u0027ve got a title, it\u0027s very difficult to shed it, she said.Harry too has told of the pressures of being a prince and has always stressed the importance of being seen as \u0027normal\u0027.Meghan Markle\u0027s baby is due in Spring next year (Image: )He confessed in 2017 that he once wanted out of the Royal Family.Harry said the time he spent in the Army - when he was just Harry - was the best escape I\u0027ve ever had and he once considered giving up his title.I felt I wanted out but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself, he said.The Earl and Countess of Wessex\u0027s children Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and Viscount Severn are actually entitled to be a princess and prince as children of the son of the sovereign.

And try out the windbag oratory on the .million decent British democrats who voted to leave the European Union, and who have been told ever since that they are racist, ignorant ­bigots who should never be allowed near a polling booth.I like Bono. In person, he is a decent, thoughtful man. His band are not bad. But why do the former rebels of rock music always tug their forelocks to the European Union  Why does everyone in leather trousers act like the EU is an unalloyed good thing  Why does rock music have a blind spot when it comes to Brussels How can Bono, right, possibly mistake Jean-Claude Juncker for Joe Strummer   The EU is the ESTABLISHMENT, man! And the EU is the ­establishment at its most ­unaccountable, undemocratic, incompetent and corrupt.The EU is not a beautul thing, Bono. It is a crumbling ­expansionist empire, rotten to the core, merciless in its opposition to democracy.The EU is a gravy train, Bono, a trough for puffed-up political piggies, a sclerotic body of ­privileged old white men in suits with MEPs who do not have to provide receipts for their £,-a-month expenses. The EU really stinks, Bono.And the music that you and I grew up with — the music we loved, the music U and I were inspired by, the music we placed at the centre of our worlds — was meant to be against this kind of thing. Bono bent the knee to the bullies of Brussels in the same week that Bob Geldof sent a ­letter to Theresa May warning her that Brexit will be the day the music dies.“Imagine Britain without its music,” thundered Geldof’s letter, co-signed by musicians including Sting, Ed Sheeran, Jarvis Cocker and Damon Albarn. “If it’s hard for us, then it’s impossible for the rest of the world. Britain does rule the waves. The airwaves. But Brexit threatens, as it does so much , this vast voice.”But it is simply not true that our country owes its musical genius to the European Union. The golden years of British music were before we joined the EU — when it was still being touted to us as a common market — back in .The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin all somehow managed to make great music without Brussels. Now Geldof and his co-signatories seriously suggest that British music can’t survive outside the European Union.No doubt the Brexit-loathing Boomtown Rat believes this rubbish but everyone  who signed his Whinge Aid letter should have paused to think before signing. Because by claiming that Brexit will kill British music, Ed Sheeran, Sting and the rest just make themselves look like laughably out-of-touch luvvies. Not a good look for the wild boys of rock ’n’ roll.Geldof is right about one thing — British music has been brilliant for  years because our little country embraced the world.But John Lennon, Jimmy Page, Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Ray Davies, Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend opened their ears and their hearts to the sounds coming out of America.The glorious music that smashed down the walls between white music and black music was born in Chicago and Nashville and Detroit and Memphis.  Its roots were in the backwoods of the Deep South and the ­Mississippi Delta, and reached all the way back to Africa. Belgium never came into it, Bob.The Rolling Stones never needed a grant from the EU. They just needed one glimpse of Buddy Holly, one listen to Muddy Waters, one nod from Elvis Presley. British bands changed the world and they sure as hell did it without the help of the European Union. Sorry, Bob. Sorry, Bono. But no British musician in history was ever inspired by the mysterious rhythms coming out of Brussels.PETER JACKSON’S new film, They Shall Not Grow Old, shows painstakingly coloured images from World War One for the very first time.Because we have only experienced World War One in black and white footage and photos, there has always felt like a huge distance between our time and the unimaginable horrors of the trenches.Lord Of The Rings director Jackson has bridged that gap and the results, above, take your breath away. He says: “The war was a colour war. You’re seeing it as they saw it. And they saw it in colour.”World War One never felt closer. And the humour, humanity and courage of the men who fought it has never been more heartbreaking.BEST wishes for the future to Trevor Engelson and his bride Tracey Kurland, who were married in a low-key ceremony in Calornia last weekend.Andyou don’t recognise the names, that is because Mr Engelson has chosen to keep a discreet silence on the subject of his two-year marriage to Meghan Markle.And in an age where every broken relationship is ­dissected on social media, isn’t it refreshing to see a man who can keep a dignied silence “WE lost the match but won the battle,” claimed Conor McGregor after his beating in last weekend’s UFC .  What planet was that victory on then, Conor To the casual fan it looked like McGregor  followed up months of denigrating Khabib Nurmagomedov with a feeble performance in the octagon and a lack of grace in defeat.True, Khabib spoilt his victory by jumping into the crowd to continue the punch-up with McGregor’s corner.  But for the le of me I can’t see how Conor McGregor can claim anything other than unconditional surrender. Neither man brought credit to MMA.There is only one reason why mainstream sports fans have been paying interest to Mixed Martial Arts in recent years and that is Conor McGregor. But after the squalid scenes around Conor v Khabib, many of us will be turning off the MMA.Even Mike Tyson was shocked. And he once bit off part of a man’s ear.WHAT my mum would have found unforgivable about Strictly star Seann Walsh snogging Katya Jones is that it happened when Walsh’s girlfriend, Rebecca Humphries, was home alone on her BIRTHDAY.My mum would never have forgiven that kind of casual cruelty from some curly-haired love rat.

But what we call the Strictly curse is really just an office romance that spirals out of control.People get thrown together at work all the time. The dference is that a couple from the accounts department don’t usually spend hours every day rubbing up against each other perfecting their Paso Doble.But the intense, intimate physical contact of doing Strictly makes it certain the curse will strike again.The mystery is why Katya was never led astray by Ed Balls.FEMALE terrorist, married to a British jihadi, claimed a council breached her human rights by not giving her a new home after she turned down seven homes because they were not big enough or not in the right location.Kindly Brent Council also offered her £, to put down a deposit on a home of her own.Are we insane Our welfare state was built to care for the most vulnerable members of our society.Not creatures who would spit on our society’s grave.TINA TURNER is the only female performer who was hotter live than Blondie’s Debbie Harry in her pouting, heavy-lidded prime.So it comes as some surprise to hear Tina say that she never tried to be sexy on stage. “Fishnets are practical,” Tina says primly. “They don’t run.

This kind of thing is so commonplace that many — some as young as eight — feel street harassment is “part of growing up”. How awful is that  Partly, the problem is that somewhere along the line, the idea that schoolgirls are “sexy” has become normalised, acceptable, even mainstream.Yes, I know that the waters were somewhat muddied by the likes of Britney Spears in her Baby One More Time video and Gemma Arterton in her St Trinian’s films — both looking as sexy as heck in school unorm.  And yes, I know a lot of girls look older than they are, and might even try to do so by wearing make-up, smoking or shortening their skirts on the way to and from school.But let’s be really clear about this. — girls young enough to wear school unorm are children. And the idea of any man thinking it’s OK to wolf-whistle, chat up or give any kind of sexual attention to a girl in a unorm is not just seriously worrying. It should be a criminal offence.By the way, I wonder what a similar survey of boys would find. Because the thought of women wolf-whistling schoolboys in the street is unimaginable, right  Parents of ­secondary school children need to give them some freedom to help them on the path to adulthood.Often, that involves letting them walk unaccompanied to school.  But the idea that doing that is exposing their child to the possibility of sexual harassment will be pretty distressing to any parent.One of the saddest things about this report is how many of the girls interviewed thought this kind of behaviour is “normal”. One -year-old said she felt street harassment was part of the “bro culture” and her dad had told her: “You know what men are like.”  What kind of advice is that for your daughter Another girl, aged , said: “It’s just become normal.” But the net result of behaviour like this is that it makes girls scared of walking the streets.All too often, our response to such news is to try to protect girls by telling them not to look too ­provocative. But that just perpetuates the idea men “can’t help themselves” so it’s down to the girls, and the way they dress, to make sure they are left alone.You can’t blame girls or women for men’s behaviour, no matter what theof their skirt. But the dficult truth is that we know women do have to ­mody their behaviour, and the way they dress, to stop men from ­commenting on their appearance, harassing them or worse.Perhaps what I am most shocked about is the young age at which this starts. One good thing is that these days, girls at secondary school have phones. They can record things that happen to them and report it. Also, Plan International UK is calling on bystanders to challenge harassment when they see it.Certainly,I was around someone wolf-whistling schoolgirls, I’d flip my lid. I would not be too scared to speak my mind and verbally intervene. I think my opening ­gambit would be: “How would you feelthat were your sister, ­granddaughter or daughter some old git was harassing ”To any man reading this who thinks it’s OK to talk to schoolgirls like this, let me tell you some of these girls are terried. It’s not funny or cute. It’s threatening. Lots of teen girls look older than they are butyou are confused and in doubt, here is a clue: The school unorm is a giveaway.Any man who leers at a child in a unorm is nothing short of ­disturbed. Andthey can’t stop themselves from doing so, the law needs to intervene.AS you know, I’m a huge advocate of body acceptance and self-love but I confess to a moment of envy at model Rachel McCord’s fantastic figure.Yes, clearly she must spend most of each day at the gym . . . But you have to give credit where credit is due. And she looks amazing!ANOTHER day, another crazy promise from Labour. This time it was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying a Labour government would bring in a four-day working week.This, as Treasury analysis shows, means Labour would have to borrow £trillion to bankroll its spending spree over the next ten years – the equivalent of £, for every UK household. Frankly,the Labour Party gets into power, it will end up being a zero-day week as business will collapse and there will be no jobs to go to. The simple fact is you can’t run a country or a business on a four-day week.I LOVE a good party as much as the next person.But I can’t be the only person who rolled my eyes at the claim that Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and actress Dakota Johnson hosted a “baby gender reveal party” on Sunday.Apparently, large arches of pink and blue balloons were spotted flying above a star- studded bash at Martin’s Malibu home. Moments later, blue balloons were freed into the air, presumably announcing a baby boy is on the way.The couple claim it was just her birthday party but the singer did help introduce us to the term “conscious uncoupling”. Stand by for this being a new thing . . .She was being “punished” for running away with her Hindu boyfriend.Police were reportedly called to the scene but did not make any arrests – which beggars belief, doesn’t it Stories like this are a reminder that religion can be a negative power as well as a positive.I COULDN’T agree more with Sir Anthony Seldon, above, Buckingham University’s vice-chancellor, who wants the uni to adopt an actively anti-drugs stance.My son is at Buckingham uni and they already have snfer dogs all around campus, randomly checking students. Sir Anthony says he wants to create a “psychological contract” between students and the university so undergraduates implicitly agree to shun drugs when they enrol, which I think is a brilliant idea.His approach is the opposite to Sheffield University, where the student union gave advice on how to take ious hard drugs safely. But the fact is drugs aren’t safe and they ruin lives.  Barely a week goes by without another drug death appearing in the news.Some might say a drug-free campus is unrealistic. And sure, you probably can’t stop everyone taking them.  Nor can you prevent people wanting to experiment.  But making young people really aware that drugs are not only dangerous but illegal can only be a good thing.A WRITER called Kamin Mohammadi had an Instagram rant about “manspreading” this week. And yes, I know this happens. But I think we’ve got to get better at politely asking people to just stop it.Forget gender for a moment. I think it comes down to respect: It’s just blatantly rude to invade someone ’s space and the answer, in my view, is to call the person out.  If someone’s arm is on my arm rest on a train or plane, I ask them – in the nicest possible way – to move it.Let’s not be embarrassed when it’s someone’s legs.My personal bugbear is backpacks. I called a man out for keeping his on while on a crowded Tube train this week and he was really apologetic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal was not right.Under such a deal, we would be required to follow EU laws under the EU rule book and we would still be subject to the European Court of Justice.We would be out of Europe, yet still run by Europe. Any proposal that is brought forward and put to Parliament needs to take back control of our laws and make sure the European Court has no say over us.  So what should Theresa May do  The answer, once again, is set out clearly in the  Conservative manesto.It says: “We will seek a deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free-trade and customs agreement.”  That’s why the Prime Minister should move on from her Chequers proposal and seek an advanced free-trade deal with the EU. A comprehensive free-trade deal, like the EU’s free-trade deals with Canada and Japan, is what our manesto promises require.Such a deal would ensure we take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade. It would honour the referendum mandate. It would be in line with our manesto commitments. And it would work for the EU too. The Government’s objection to this is the supposed dficulty of keeping an open border in Northern Ireland.For this reason, Government figures claim we cannot seek a trade deal with the EU unless this problem is solved. This is nonsense.Clear proposals have been set out by two former Northern Ireland Secretaries as to how a frictionless border can be maintained under a free-trade agreement. These proposals have been endorsed by former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Good Friday Agreement architect Lord Trimble.Moreover, former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has set out how we can build on the system of joint border controls at Dover to avoid delays or friction at the UK’s borders — including in Ireland. This would work for the EU’s rules and ensure a positive future relationship going forward.This approach is not simply a bad use of taxpayers’ money. It breaks another manesto pledge.For our  manesto says “it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside our withdrawal, reaching agreement on both within two years” of our serving notice to leave the EU. In other words, by the end of March next year.So it is wrong for the Government to agree withdrawal terms without sorting out the full detail of our future relationship. A temporary fix does not honour the referendum mandate, it does not keep our manesto promise and it certainly fails to look after our hard-earned money.Moreover, would this temporary fix really be temporary  Just ask the people of Norway how such a deal turned out for them. In  they signed the European Economic Area Agreement. They were told by the EU their sovereignty would be respected. Yet  years later, this “temporary” arrangement has become permanent.Meanwhile, the cost has increased ten-fold and nearly , EU directives and regulations have been implemented through Norway’s EEA agreement.Our Government should fear to tread such a dangerous path. Voters will not tolerate any “temporary” arrangement becoming permanent. They would see it as a betrayal. People voted to leave the EU because they wanted change. They believed in Britain and the land of opportunity we can build. They voted to take back control of our laws, money, borders and trade.The Conservative manesto promised that we would leave the EU altogether. That we would seek a free-trade deal and a new national future.Now is the time for the Government to honour the referendum mandate and the Conservative manesto by seeking a free­-trade deal with the EU that enables Britain to become an economic powerhouse in the decades to come.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Avery will know all about her big sister but we will always be sad that they never got to meet each other and grow up with one another, forming the bonds and friendships sisters should.Louise said previously: Our babyhad little nails and hair and she was fully formed, fully developed, ready to be born the next day.But now, we know that without I might not be alive had it not been for the accident- and little Avery wouldnt have been born, and I wouldnt be here to have more children in the future.Because of the extra blood I had in me due to my pregnancy, and because Layla cushioned the bump, I wouldnt have lived had it not been for her.I will never forget those words, Im sorry, your baby has died.The mum has joined their legal team at Irwin Mitchell in using Baby Loss Awareness Week to speak out about the support available to other families who have experienced the heartbreak of losing a child.Tracey Storey, Partner and specialist serious injury lawyer at the firm, said: It may have been two years since Layla’s death but the pain and loss that Louise and Laurence continue to experience is still understandably extremely raw.While no amount of money will ever make up for what has happened, we are pleased that Louise has been able to access the support she needs so she, Laurence and their family can try and look to the future the best they can while never forgetting Layla."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000160567226.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the who roger daltry eu bosses brexit jeremy corbyn","story":"The rocknroll legend lashed out at f***ing Jean-Claude Juncker for not following the blocs own rules.And he said the EUs structure is completely flawed and will collapse one day and he was sure it would bring Europe to its knees.Why would we stay in a ship with a hole in it  he told the Sunday Times Magazine today.He went on: What I’m against is Brussels, those nightmare, shadowy people in Brussels.It’s like being governed by Fa.

It has to come back to le,” he added.In August this year Plymouth Live reported that the development of a “stunning waterfront location entertaining the rich and famous” could finally begin after a marine licence was granted to enable the repair of the ageing jetty.It said this work would clear the way for “experts to gain access and begin transforming the maritime jewel into a world-class spa complete with a high-end hotel, conference facilities and a posh restaurant with commanding views of Plymouth Sound.”Formerly known as St Nicholas Island, after a chapel there, it was used during the Tudor period, having been fortied from “at least the th century”, according to Plymouth City Council.The first fortication was commissioned as part of the country’s maritime line of defence during the war with France, and strengthened in the late s by the installation of guns and garrisons during the war with Spain.It was named after Sir Francis Drake as he set sail from the island in  to famously circumnavigate the globe.Interestingly, two centuries later, Royal Museums Greenwich says, “the first recorded submarine fatality occurred north of Drake’s Island just two years after Captain Cook’s departure [from Plymouth in ], when a carpenter named John Day died while testing a wooden ing chamber.”Although regarded as a heritage site of national importance, with signicant wildle, the council last year gave the green light for a major resort complex.This includes conversion of the existing Grade II buildings and the Scheduled Ancient Monument casemated battery.Drake’s Island’s website explains its plans include reusing the former Governor’s island house, barrack block and ablutions building “as the core for the hotel development”.The barracks will be turned into a -room hotel, while the casemates will become luxury suites.An extensive network of underground tunnel, originally intended for the store of ammunitions and safe passage to the Casemates, will provide access and points of interest for visitors to the island.They will also “serve as cellars and wine stores for the hotel,” the website said.John Kinsey, a director at JLL in Exeter, which is marketing the property, said: Drakes Island is a remarkable piece of British history and a much-loved landmark that the Plymouth community holds close to its heart."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000441636939.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cops let thief go 9k tools","story":"Cops were called when neighbours spotted shty men breaking into Slawek Zarebas vehicle overnight on Saturday.Officers arrived and found a man loading nearly  boxes of gear from Mr Zarebas van into another car in Morden, South London.But instead of nicking the thief on the spot, blundering cops had a chat with him and allowed the chancer to drive off with a car full of loot.Tradesman Mr Zareba , woke the next morning to find his whole van emptied.He now has no tools to work with and has slammed cops for letting the theft unfold in front of them. He said: Its absolutely ridiculous what happened.I cant understand what the police are playing at.It was am at the time and I was inside my house, completely unaware of what was happening.Instead of quizzing the thief, checking the car registration details or even knocking my door to double-check, they had a talk with him and watched as they let him waltz off into the night.The police havent even apologised or been back to get fingerprints from my van or look at the CCTV.I havent been able to work since and am losing money.CCTV footage shows the moment police arrive and speak to the thief - who has his own car boot open and a collection of Mr Zarebas tools hanging out the back.Cops bizarrely then get back in their patrol car and drive off behind his car - only for the man tosome  minutes later and continue raiding the van.The gaffe follows reports that cops are not properly investigating nearly a million reported crimes a year.Home Office data shows police abandoned nearly three quarters of car theft probes without identying a suspect.And figures show four fths of house burglaries and nearly half of shoplting cases go unsolved.A Met Police spokesman said: Police were called to reports of a vehicle being broken into in Morden, South London.Officers attended and found a man loading tools from a van into another vehicle.The man gave an explanation for his actions and no arrests were made.Police later established the tools had been stolen.

Cutting air passenger duty is exactly the kind of policy that Brexit Britain should embrace.”Cutting it will make holidays cheaper for families who have been hit by pricier trips because of the weaker Pound.On long haul flights, there is a £ tax on an economy ticket. This is a huge leap from  when it was just £.There is no environmental justication, it is simply used to fill the Treasury’s coffers. Slashing it will also boost businesses hoping to sell products outside of the EU. It will show Brexit Britain is an outward-looking, global nation.We hope you’re listening, Mr Hammond.“It would make saving for hard-earned holidays easier, and it would also make the UK a more attractive place to come to.The Chancellor this March launched a review into APD in Northern Ireland as promised in the confidence and supply deal Theresa May struck with the DUP after last year’s Election disaster.Belfast Airport claims that nearly a million passengers have switched to Dublin in the past year, where the tax was axed in  by Ireland’s then transport minister, current Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Ms Patel and Mr Wilson said a cut would prove Northern Ireland was “open for business” as well as other regional UK airports.The total contribution from APD for the Treasury has ballooned from £ million in  to £. billion – a rise of  per cent.But campaigners claim there is little evidence the money is being used to tackle environmental issues.Frontier Economics last month claimed more than  new airline routes may be added at UK airportsthe Government abolished APD altogether.The think tank claimed an extra  routes would become viable, including eight new destinations from Aberdeen, nine from Belfast and seven from Southampton.James Roberts, political director of the Taxpayers Alliance, said: “Air Passenger Duty manages to fly under most people’s radar, but it has to be one of the most pointless taxes out there.“There’s no real environmental justication – it’s just a straight up levy on both family holidays and air trade links.”The summer holidays are a distant memory and families across the country will be starting to save up for next year’s trip. Yet a big chunk of that cost doesn’t pay for your holiday - it goes straight into the government’s coffers.Buying a ticket for a long-haul flight out of the UK will set you back at least £ in air passenger duty, a tax levied on all adult flyers from UK airports. So for a family of four flying in economy class, you’d have to fork out £, on top of whatever the airline is charging as their fare and airport charges.This is quite the increase from when two rates of either £ or £ was introduced in .Research released last year by A Fair Tax On Flying, which campaigns for a reduction in air passenger duty, shows that this tax makes up  per cent of the average cost of a European short-haul ticket.Looking around, you quickly realise our tax on flying is giving Brits a raw deal. The UK has the highest short and long-haul aviation tax anywhere in Europe. Countries nearby, like Ireland, have abolished their air taxes after seeing the bad effects it had for their economies. Northern Ireland gets hit particularly bad, as holidaymakers head to Dublin to dodge the unnecessary costs.Flying does have consequences, like emissions and noise for people who live right near airports, but the £. billion it raises pays for those many times over.Cutting air passenger duty is exactly the kind of policy that Brexit Britain should embrace. It would make saving for those hard-earned holidays easier, and it would also make the UK a more attractive place to come to. It would be a massive boon for Northern Ireland. Tourists and exporters would see that the country is open for business.Committing to cut air passenger duty in half would be a great message and save flyers millions. That’s why MPs from dferent parties are supporting this campaign from the TaxPayers’ Alliance and A Fair Tax On Flying. The Chancellor should commit to this in next week’s budget and make saving for holidays that bit easier.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick has threatened to ban fundraising sites like JustGiving from slapping the five per cent fee on Gt Aid.Peter Lewis, head of the Institute of Fundraising said: “We welcome today’s announcement from JustGiving.“We are pleased to see JustGiving continuing to develop its model and responding proactively to enable donors’ money to go even further, especially at times of major incidents.JustGiving boss Jerry Needel said: “We are very proud to announce that from today, people using JustGiving can crowdfund for free.”He added: “Following feedback from our amazing community of fundraisers, we are also announcing that JustGiving will now be free to use following major incidents including acts of terrorism, catastrophes or natural disasters.“We know people want to help those affected as quickly as possible after these events and we want to do everything we can to support that.”“We are excited about the signicant changes we are making and look forward to continuing our work supporting thousands of charities and millions of iniduals raising funds for the causes that matter to them the most.”Labour MP Neil Coyle, who has lobbied the government to ban sites from charging fees on donations, demanded JustGiving pay back the half a million pounds it took from Grenfell and terror attack funds last year.He said: It is reassuring that no company will again profit when disasters or terrorists strike in our country.But JustGiving must acknowledge the damage theyve done by picking the pockets of all the people affected by Grenfell or last years terror atrocities. Its payback timethey want to rebuild trust completely.John Coventry from the GoFundMe site, which doesnt charge a penny for fundraising, said: The vast majority of campaigns on JustGiving are people raising money for charity, and the companys whopping % fees will still apply to all those running marathons and doing their sponsored walks.When it comes to gt aid - JustGiving will keep pocketing % of taxpayers cash under the cover of a consultation. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We risk being sold down the river.Barring a last-minute revolt by Tory Brexiteers, Brussels has won and we have lost. The world’s sixth-largest economy will not just be worse off outside the EU, but reduced to a powerless political pawn on its margins — and paying for it.Sniggering can be heard across the capitals of Europe, with France guffawing loudest. The British Lion is a toothless kitten and we are the laughing stock of Europe.Unless stopped by her Cabinet, her MPs or by Parliament itself, this Prime Minister seems to be leading us to the greatest defeat since the Norman Conquest in , the last time we capitulated to a foreign power.The ransom demanded for our degrading humiliation — £BILLION of taxpayers’ money — is merely a down payment. The botched Chequers deal will bind this country in subordination to Europe.Forget about becoming a sovereign, free-trading nation. We will accept EU rules indefinitely while having no say at all in their terms or conditions. In effect, our economy will be run by Brussels, not by our democratically elected government.For an example of missed opportunities and failed leadership, this beats even last year’s election disaster, which wasted the first Tory majority for  years and put Marxist Labour within grasp of power.Worse, it now seems the PM’s apparent last-ditch capitulation was stitched up months ago behind closed doors after a dodgy threat by car giants to leave the UK.Now the Tory party is in uproar, with cries for a leadership contest. Downing Street is stupidly threatening a snap election. Nobody buys that except Jeremy Corbyn, who is licking his lips at the scent of power. Ministers, like frogs in a pot, are sizing up whether to jump or stew. Careers will be made or broken.At least three — and maybe six — are threatening to quit at tomorrow’s Cabinet unless Theresa blinks. Tory MPs are close to triggering a leadership fight, with sketchy plans for a quick and ruthless contest. “We have the numbers,” says one Tory MP.“If anything the mood is hardening, not softening.”Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, the first rebel to quit Cabinet, will certainly run, infuriating Boris Johnson, who thinks it should be him. Once the gun is fired, half the Cabinet and plenty of hopefuls will join in.Everyone deserves blame, including Brexiteers who assumed the game was over after their victorious out vote and abandoned the field. Remainers are at fault for refusing to accept the will of the people — and the shortcomings of their beloved EU.But it is Downing Street, and Theresa May personally, who must take responsibility. Mrs May has dreamed of being Prime Minister since she was a child.It’s a tough job. It means leading from the front, making swt decisions and rallying the country with confidence and authority in dficult times.Instead, Mrs May’s team talk like defeatists about parliamentary “arithmetic”. How can she push through a dficult Brexit against ferocious opposition without a commanding Commons majority  But who was responsible for that parliamentary arithmetic It was Theresa May alone who decided to call an unforced election and it was she who single-handedly blew it. Her only task was to deliver the referendum mandate handed to her by .million voters. She blew that, too.People knew the risks. They did not vote for us to stay half-in, half-out or to see our sovereignty handed over to foreign powers. To govern is to decide.

The statement said: In the last few days UK and EU negotiators have made real progress in a number of key areas. However there remain a number of unresolved issues relating to the backstop.  “The UK is still committed to making progress at the October European Council.” The backstop – a mechanism to avoid a hard border – poses a threat to Mrs May’s leadership. The EU’s version would keep just Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels’ rules. Mrs May’s counter-proposal is for a “temporary customs arrangement” for the whole of the UK. But Tory Brexiteers fear it could become an open-ended position which would prevent free trade deals around the world. Mr Hunt insisted only Mrs May could get the right deal for Britain, adding: “She is battling for Britain”. But Tory MP Nadine Dorries suggesting installing Mr Davis as interim leader, adding: “Getting May out and him becoming an interim leader may be the only way to deliver Brexit and FTA.” And former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Britain was at a moment of crisis, adding: The EU is treating this country with naked contempt.  The “pizza club” has reportedly met secretly during times of crisis in Brexit negotiations. Its latest meeting comes ahead of a crunch summit of EU leaders on Wednesday. And at least nine Ministers want Mrs May to drop her current EU plan when the Cabinet meets on Tuesday. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis on Sunday urged a full-scale rebellion against her. He wrote: “It is time for the Cabinet to exert their collective authority. This week the authority of our constitution is on the line.” Allies of Mr Davis said he has been contacted by several Tory MPs urging him to run for the leadership. He is understood to be prepared to runthere is a contest.  Critics of Mrs May believe the no confidence vote threshold could be passed by Wednesdayshe refuses to change her position. At least four Cabinet Minister are rumoured to be seriously considering quitting over her Brexit plan. Speculation has centred on Andrea Leadsom , Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey . But Scottish Secretary David Mundell, and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, could also quit. In a letter to the PM, the pair said the integrity of the UK “remains the single most important issue for us”. They indicated they will not tolerate a situation in which Northern Ireland is treated dferently from the rest of Britain over the EU customs issues. A source close to Ms Davidson said the issue was a “red line” for her, while a source close to Mr Mundell said resigning was a “logical outcome” for those who do not agree with Government policy.

Launching the first loneliness strategy, the Prime Minister confirmed English GPs will be able to refer lonely people to community and voluntary activities by , as she paid tribute to murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, who had campaigned to end loneliness before her death.  Mrs May said: “Jo Cox was absolutely right to highlight the critical importance of this growing social injustice which sits alongside childhood obesity and mental well-being as one of the greatest public health challenges of our time. “I was pleased to be able to support the Loneliness Commission set up in Jo’s name and I am determined to do everything possible to take forward its recommendations. “This strategy is only the beginning of delivering a long and far reaching social change in our country - but it is a vital first step in a national mission to end loneliness in our letimes.”  Loneliness is one of the greatest public health challenges of our time, Mrs May said, and is linked to illnesses including heart disease, strokes and Alzheimer’s disease. About , older people have not had a conversation with a friend or relative in more than a month and three-quarters of GPs said they see up to five people every day suffering loneliness.  Speaking on behalf of the Jo Cox Foundation, Jo’s sister Kim Leadbeater said she was delighted to see the strategy being launched. She said: “The work on loneliness has been a hugely important part of Jo’s legacy and it is heartwarming to see how much progress has been made on the subject since her murder.” As well as social prescriptions, postal workers will be encouraged to check in with lonely people on their delivery rounds in a new scheme with Royal Mail in Liverpool, New Malden and Whitby.

The national interest is largely forgotten with Brexit a battleground for Tory rivals, bloodlust opponents agonising over what’s best for them rather than the country. When the post of Prime Minister’s the goal of wavering Ministers calculating whether it’s better to back or sack May, the jobs of millions who voted to Leave and Remain are collateral damage for Tories obsessed with their own futures. I’ve never witnessed a Government disintegrate with the poisonous animosity of May’s collapsing regime. The reigns of Thatcher, Major, Blair, Brown and particularly Cameron finished in acrimony – an iron law of politics the tenure of all PMs end in failure. Yet this Conservative uncivil war’s unmatched in bile, squabbling Tories too busy scoring points against each other to champion Britain in negotiations with  united European neighbours.  At such a crucial juncture for the country, revolting Conservative MPs coming close to submitting the  letters triggering a self-indulgent leadership contest is proof Brexit is all about them, not you. Plastic patriots, right-wing nationalists blindly waving flags to hide their cluelessness, call the shots in a misgoverning party’s increasing Ukipisation that is symbolised by the membership of a purple Colonel Blimp former MEP, offensive reactionary Godfrey Bloom. So Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey fret over staying or going, boosting or ruining their chances of the Premiership. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid fuss over supporting or opposing May’s Brexit plan for the same reasons.  And David Davis and Boris Johnson compete to be the most aggressive quitter. Whatever Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, another with his eye on the personal prize, agrees with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is irrelevantMay loses the Tory Party, never mind Parliament. She is left relying on Labour rebels in a salvage operation, just as Ted Heath depended on John Smith to take us into Europe in . The best deal remains Britain’s continued EU membership. The tragedy is too many MPs are scared to tell the truth.

The Prime Minister will address the House of Commons from .pm in a bombshell moment with just two days to go to a crucial summit. This morning her key allies, the DUP, declared a no-deal Brexit is probably inevitable as government sources admitted they were stuck in a signicant problem. A dash to Brussels by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab ended in failure last night - and further talks are said to be off until a summit of  leaders on Wednesday. Last night Downing Street pointedly refused to say Mrs May - who faces a two-pronged Tory pizza plot against her leadership - was hoping for a deal at this weeks meeting. They only said she is expecting progress. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said today it appears unlikely a deal will be reached. If so, she said, the need to change course becomes all the more necessary as no responsible government should contemplate No Deal. The Scottish First Minister said it would be better to stay in the EU single market, extend the date of Brexit or even back a second EU referendum than be railroaded into a reckless blindfold Brexit.  Preparations for quitting without a deal on  March  are now poised to spring into action within weeks. Top civil servants have warned contingency plans must start being put into effect by the end of the month - whatever the situation, the Times reports. Otherwise they face not being ready with stockpiles of medicine and extra customs and border checks in time for  March . Talks between the EU and UK are still in deadlock over the issue of the Northern Ireland border. The EU wants to put in checks between the province and the rest of the UK. And No was looking at dropping an end date on its backup plan to keep borders open. Both plans enrage Tory Brexiteers and the DUP .  Theresa Mays spokesman declared today that the EU “continues to insist on the possibility of a customs border down the Irish Sea. The spokesman added: [That] is something which Parliament has already unanimously rejected and which is not acceptable to the Prime Minister”. Today its reported all further technical talks have been called off until Wednesday - when Theresa May must thrash out a political deal at a frantic EU summit. That could throw the entire Brexit timetable into doubt and ramps up the chance of a damaging No Deal exit.  Wednesdays summit in Brussels was meant to be the moment of truth that would open up a final crossing the Ts gathering in November. Evena deal is reached, it then has to pass a vote in the UK Parliament - where Tory Brexiteers and the DUP have vowed to defeat any sign of compromise. Theresa May relies on her  DUP allies to prop her up because she has no majority. Today DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told the Belfast News Letter: Given the way in which the EU has behaved and the corner theyve put Theresa May into, theres no deal which I can see at present which will command a majority in the House of Commons. So it is probably inevitable that we will end up with a no deal scenario. Mrs May is expected to meet Sinn Fein leader Mary-Lou McDonald and its leader in the Northern Ireland Assembly Michelle ONeill in Downing Street later.  Labours Sir Keir Starmer said the Government must now publish details of its revised plans for the Irish border. At the moment we dont even know what the proposal is that everybody has fallen out about over the weekend, the shadow Brexit secretary told BBC Radio s Today programme. That needs to be looked at and scrutinised in Parliament. Irelands ambassador to the UK, Adrian ONeill, said events in Brussels were a setback and could increase the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. He told BBC Radio s Westminster Hour: Time is running out, there is no doubt about that. In all member states, preparation for all eventualities are ramping up quite signicantly.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted talks were going through a dficult period but that there was always going to be a moment like this. Arriving in Brussels for a meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council he said a deal was still possiblethere was goodwill on all sides saying: There are one or two very dficult outstanding issues but I think we can get there. Whether we do this week or not, who knows  But Brexiteer Cabinet ministers will tonight plot over pizza how to kill off Theresa Mays plan - while reports suggest she has  no confidence letters against her, four short of triggering a leadership battle. Tory MP Nadine Dorries suggesting installing David Davis - who has called for a Cabinet insurrection - as interim leader. And former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson demanded Mrs May chuck her plans, adding: The EU is treating this country with naked contempt.

EU officials have warned time is running out - and with every day the chance of a No Deal Brexit grows greater.So what is stopping a deal from happening  Who wants what, and why are they so opposed to each other  Heres a guide that you dont need a political PhD to understand.  What is the problem  Everyone disagrees over how to solve a double-locked puzzle - the Northern Ireland border.Lock number one: At the moment, goods and people can move freely with no fences, guards or checks between Northern Irelandand the Republic of Ireland .This must not change, because it will break up the peace process that was hard-won in . Lock number two: At the moment, goods and people can move freely with no fences, guards or checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.This must not change, because it will break up the union of the United Kingdom.  So Theresa May somehow has to rip the UK away from EU rules - yet not have any checks on either of these borders. How can you have dferent rules in dferent territories with no checks between any of them them  What the EU wants  The EU dreamed up a backstop - backup plan - that would prevent those locks breaking until there is a proper trade deal. Under the EUs plan, Northern Ireland would use many of the same customs rules as the EU to prevent a hard border - checks - with the Republic. But this would then force us to check goods travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, such as live animals and animal products. EU negotiator Michel Barnier said this could be as simple as scanning bar codes on the side of lorries in ferry ports. But Theresa May warned this would draw a border down the Irish Sea and break up the Union.And thats enraged an until now little-known party called the DUP...What the DUP want  The Democratic Unionist Party , a Northern Irish political party, are utterly opposed to anything that draws a line between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. That definitely includes customs checks. The DUP are very influential, because last year Theresa May handed over pound.bn to Northern Ireland in exchange for their  MPs voting with her government. DUP officials are now saying No Deal Brexit looks inevitable after their leader, Arlene Foster, visited Brussels and couldnt find a breakthrough. But the DUP fear theyll be left behind in a compromise they cant back. If that happens, they have threatened to vote down the Budget on October .AndTHAT happens, it will pile enormous pressure on a little someone called Theresa May...What Theresa May wants  Theresa May has drawn up a dferent backstop to try and please both the EU, and the DUP. Under her plan, the WHOLE of the UK would stay in EU customs rules for a temporary period while a full trade deal is worked out. This would prevent border checks on all sides. But no one can agree how long it will last. She wanted to make this plan end no later than  December . But the EU said this was impossible, because how can something be a backup planit has an expiry date  So officials are now looking at continuing EU customs rules in the UK temporarily in name - but actually, without a set end date. The problem is this will stop the UK signing trade deals around the world until the backstop lts. It will keep the UK locked into the EUs orbit for an unknown period.And as you might expect, that has infuriated Tory MPs...What Tory MPs want   or more Tory MPs are in three groups. A small crop of hard Remainers a big bunch wholl be loyal to Theresa May and up to  Hard Brexiteers. Its this last group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, who make the noise, stir up headlines and fuel talk of toppling Mrs May with a leadership bid. These Tories are sick of the fudge and compromise. They want Hard Brexit, a sharp break from Brussels, and a Canada Plus deal which would be like the EUs agreement with Canada , but, erm, better. Critics accuse these Tories of skating over crucial practical details, sweeping away protections against chlorinated chicken and dumping workers rights.Critics who include the Labour Party...What Labour want  Labour arent in office but they have one big power - deciding whether to vote for the Brexit deal in Parliament. The party has set six tests that the final Brexit deal must passbefore Labour will vote in favour. The most controversial is number two - because pretty much everyone knows we cant have a Brexit with the exact same benefits as we do now. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer insisted he was just using the same language as Tory ministers. But even his shadow cabinet colleague Barry Gardiner has branded the tests bollocks. And not all Labour MPs will agree with what the party decides. Some, like Caroline Flint, have suggested they will back Theresa Mays plan because the alternative is leaving with no deal at all.Does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU  Does it deliver the “exact same benefits” as we currently have as members of the Single Market and Customs Union  Does it ensure the fair management of migration in the interests of the economy and communities  Does it defend rights and protections and prevent a race to the bottom  Does it protect national security and our capacity to tackle cross-border crime Does it deliver for all regions and nations of the UK  What is Chequers and how does it fit in   The UKs current Brexit plan is based on a deal Theresa May drew up at Chequers, her country retreat, in July .At the time it was seen as a major sht to soft Brexit - prompting hard-Leaver Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign.The Facilitated Customs Arrangement would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. Under this plan, the UK would share a common rulebook with Brussels for goods, including agricultural and food products. Britain would also collect some, but not all, customs tarfs on the EUs behalf. It was a bid to solve the Irish border in the long term. But it was rejected by Labour, Tory MPs, some Cabinet ministers, and the EU, who said it will not work. That is why UK officials have been drawing up new plans to solve the Irish border question behind closed doors... and why weve had to write a new explainer. Where do we go from here   - October :  EU leaders meet Theresa May in Brussels for a moment of truth summit. It looks like a full deal wont be struck. But crucially, they will decide whether theres enough progress to call another summit in November. End of October : No Deal preparations have to begin in the UK government no matter what, because otherwise they wont be ready on time.  October : The Budget. It will spell out no deal preparations and be a test of loyalty for the DUP, who are supposed to vote with the government but could rebel. Mid-November : The UK is hoping for a final Brexit summit where she it seal not just a deal, but a political declaration on future trade. This is danger moment one, where Theresa Mays Cabinet ministers could resign or trigger a leadership coup. End of November : MPs hold a vote on any deal in Parliament. This is danger moment two for Theresa May, who will be in deep, deep troubleshe loses the vote. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - will end."},{"url":null,"title":"prince philip doesnt agree charles","story":"NewsPrince Philip doesnt agree with Charles ideas for future of the royal familyTensions have apparently been rising between the pair over Charles plans including those for Buckingham PalaceShareCommentsByHana Carter:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video queen-elizabeth-prince-philip-arrive-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince Philip doesnt agree with his son Prince Charless plans for the future of the royal family, it is claimed.

Fans of the royal family were overjoyed at the happy news, which came just days after the UK celebrated Princess Eugenies wedding .However, some people couldnt help but draw a connection with the timing of the babys arrival and another massive change going on in the UK at the moment. Self-confessed cynics on Twitter thought the timing of the news couldnt possibly be a coincidence - because the baby would arrive at around the same time the UK will leave the European Union.

The spot is owned by Towie star Elliott Wright in the upmarket resort of La Cala, situated on Spains Costa Del Sol. The trendy beachfront restaurant is also the location for ITVBe reality show Playa in Marbella. Staff at the restaurant had emailed the husband and we asking asking them what they were going to wear to make sure they adhered to the dress code.  But the Manchester couple say they were then informed that they would not be admitted after Michael sent them a picture of the shoes he was planning to wear. HGV driver Michael says he was forced off the beach back to his hotel where he took a picture of his pound Guiseppe designer pumps. Staff told the pair that they would not be able to get in because the footwear violated their strict no trainer policy.Hair stylist Keelie told The Sun Online : Michael was absolutely devastated — he went to so much work making my birthday special but had to tell me my surprise was ruined.They said they had even been prepared to pay pound for a taxi drive along the Costa Del Sol coast to get to the exclusive spot form their hotel in Marbella. Keelie said: They were just so snooty and totally unbothered about it — they just couldnt care less about their own customers. The restaurant phoned back to say that they would make an exception in this case - but Keelie refused to go because they would have felt unwelcome.  Keelie said: Ive never heard anything like it in all my le. I had seen Olivias on TV and always wanted to go. They kept ringing us over and over while we were trying to enjoy my birthday at the beach. And after all that Michael was told our booking was cancelled out of hand.  They said Michael needed to wear boating shoes or loafers — you basically need to dress like youre from Essex. They really need to know how to treat their customers better. Now I’m so disheartened — on my birthday night we resorted to sitting in the local bar instead. But Elliott told The Sun: This is a very simple situation. This man’s footwear did not fall in line with our strict dress code at the restaurant.  It is irrelevant what his shoes cost, we do not allow any trainers, designer or not. We are always upfront with customers on email about the dress-code rules so we don’t disappoint anyone on arrival. In this man’s case, we actually made an exception and allowed his reservation to stand -he didn’t want to take that, that’s his prerogative. We will continue with our strict dress-code policy. We will also continue to ensure that our wonderful customers continue to have an exceptional experience, and unrivalled food, drink, and entertainment at Olivia’s.

The pair said they were delighted by portrait photographer Alex Bramalls images which display their joy at tying the knot. Heres some of the things you may have missed on first glance:Prince Philip is seated next to the Duchess of YorkSarah Ferguson is not the most popular person in the Royal Family and rumour has it that Prince Philip particularly dislikes his former daughter-in-law. Despite remaining firm friends, the wedding is also believed to be the first time Andrew and Fergie have been photographed together since their orce was finalised in . Placing Fergie so close to the royals may be a conscious effort to ease the long-standing animosity between the feuding family members. But while this is clearly a happy occassion for both Philip and the Duchess of York, the Duke of Edinburghs lean to the right may be telling. Queen does something we dont often see Weddings are happy occasions but its not often that the ever-professional Queen is pictured with a beaming smile. The proud grandparent looked particularly chuffed in the officially released photo. Dressed in blue, she is sat to the left of the newlyweds and looks very happy in what must have been an incredibly proud moment for her.  One of the photos clearly displays the affection that the royal newlyweds have for each other as they made their way to a private evening dinner on Friday night. Eugenie, who opted for a gorgeous blush-coloured silk Zac Posen design, is staring affectionately at her new husband as they walk hand-in-hand. The pair would have be forgiven for showing some wedding day nerves ahead of the speeches - but not for this contented couple.

Queen Victoria’s Wheat-Ear Brooches were originally commissioned by William IV in  for Queen Adelaide, according to the royal familys website. They were passed down to Queen Victoria in , and eventually to The Queen in . Her Majesty has worn them as both hair slides and brooches. A royal jewellery blogger notes that six exist, but the Queen wears them infrequently. In , on a visit to the US, she was seen wearing one in her hair, while in  she had one pinned to her chest.

Even at their tender age, the pair have had lots of practice smiling for cameras. In the main family picture, however, the page boys and bridesmaids appeared to be under a bit of strain. Lets hope they were able to find their energy for the rest of the festivities. Mia Tindall wasnt impressed with getting her picture taken  Zara and Mike Tindalls little girl and great-granddaughter of the Queen did not look at all amused in the pictures. Little Mia failed to raise even a hint of a smile as she sits on a footstool in front of Prince George. The photographer also appeared to struggle to get the four-year-old to look into the camera.

King George V - Harrys great great grandfather - limited titles within the royal family in . This means Harry and Meghans first born, as a great-grandchild of the Queen, is too far down the line of succession to be an HRH. The baby will be seventh in the line, pushing Princess Eugenie - wed on Friday - to th. George V declared that: The grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male lineshall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms.  The eldest son and heir apparent of a duke can use one of his fathers lesser grade peerage titles by courtesy, according to Debretts. So a first son of Harrys would become Earl of Dumbarton - one of the subsidiary titles Harry received from the Queen on the morning of his wedding. A daughter would be LadyMountbatten-Windsor, and any subsequent sons LordMounbatten-Windsor. But the Queen could make changes to allow Harry and Meghans children to be HRHs and princes and princesses.  Ahead of Prince Georges birth, the monarch issued a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridge children had fitting titles. Without this Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis would have been a Lady and a Lord instead, but Prince George, as the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, would still have been a prince. The Queen could decide to do the same for Harry and Meghans baby. But this royal infant is unlikely ever to accede to the throne. The duke may heed the words of his cousin Zara Tindall when discussing such matters with the Queen, and deciding which titles his child should use. Zara, who was born Miss Zara Phillips, has spoken of how not having a title was a blessing.  Ive been very lucky. My parents didnt give us titles, so weve been able to have a slightly more normal upbringing. As soon as youve got a title, its very dficult to shed it, she said. Harry too has told of the pressures of being a prince and has always stressed the importance of being seen as normal. He confessed in  that he once wanted out of the Royal Family. Harry said the time he spent in the Army - when he was just Harry - was the best escape Ive ever had and he once considered giving up his title.  I felt I wanted out but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself, he said. The Earl and Countess of Wessexs children Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and Viscount Severn are actually entitled to be a princess and prince as children of the son of the sovereign. But the couple decided, with the Queens agreement, that their children would use the courtesy titles as sons or daughters of an earl rather than the style prince or princess. An example of a royal duke handing down a courtesy title to his son is the Queens cousin the Duke of Gloucester when his son Alexander was born in .  Alex is known by the dukes subsidiary title Earl of Ulster, while the dukes daughters, before their marriages, were Lady Davina Windsor, and Lady Rose Windsor. Earl of Ulsters own son Xan - the dukes grandchild - is Lord Culleden - taken from the dukes third title Baron Culleden. If Harry had a son who had a son - Harrys grandchild - he would be Lord Kilkeel, taken from Harrys third title Baron Kilkeel.

The Duchess of Sussex arrived with her husband via a side door and was whisked straight into the ceremony - but viewers watching at home spotted what they - now rightly - thought was a bump under her coat.  Meghan dazzled in a navy blue Givenchy dress, but the way her coat was unbuttoned at her stomach meant it gaped open.And many royal fans thought they spied a hint of a bump and took to Twitter to specualte.One wrote: Something about Meghans outfit choice makes me think shes pregnant and hiding a baby bump.

Diana is an obvious favourite with our punters so far, and it wouldnt be the first tribute the couple have paid to the late princess, while Arthur and Alice have been popular picks too, a spokesman said. Odds that the newborn will have red hair just like Harry are   at Paddy Power, who also have odds of   that the baby will share US president Donald Trumps first name.  Meanwhile, Ladbrokes are offering   that the baby will be named after Meghans outspoken half-sister Samantha Markle. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: Given this child will be in line to the throne, its probably a safe assumption that the couple will opt for a regal name that has been used in the royal family over the generations. However, with Meghans USA roots it would be remiss of bookmakers to rule out an American moniker featuring somewhere.

The couple wed in St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle in May and attended the nuptials of Harrys cousin, Princess Eugenie, at the end of last week. The Duchess of Sussex arrived with her husband via a side door and was whisked straight into the ceremony - but viewers watching at home spotted what they thought was a bump under her coat. Meghan dazzled in a gorgeous, navy blue Givenchy dress. However, the way her coat was unbuttoned at her stomach meant it gaped open. This potentially caused her to look slightly larger around the middle than she usually does - and people were convinced it meant she was pregnant.  The rumour mill went into overdrive on Twitter as she made her way into the chapel. One wrote: Something about Meghans outfit choice makes me think shes pregnant and hiding a baby bump. Its so conservative. Another thought the couple were reserving their happy news until after Harrys cousins wedding. They wrote: I really think Sunday or Monday we are going to have announcements for Meghan pregnant. That viewer really couldnt have been more accurate, as Kensington Palace announced this morningthat the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting their first child together. Another said: Look, I’m convinced Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant. That coat ensemble is beautul but questionable! Some suggested that the fact she didnt take off her coat in the chapel hinted at a pregnancy, but royals rarely take off their coats at official engagementsit is part of their outfit.  One person argued that we saw Meghan just a few days ago and she didnt look as though she had anything to hide. They shared a photo of her in a fitted teal skirt, saying: This was a few days ago. If Meghan is pregnant, she doesnt have to hide it yet.

William, the only one of Anita Hyams three children to be conceived without fertility drugs, weighed just lb oz when he was delivered at  weeks and five days - almost four months early. And now, having seen William grow into a healthy -month-old toddler, Anita, , of Southend, Essex, is concerned the abortion limit should be lowered. She said: People have abortions at  weeks and yet look at William, he is alive and kicking and a fully-formed baby. He is not quite as developed as other babies his age, but he is getting there, and he is alive.  She added: I was only  weeks pregnant when I went into labour and I knew that people could have abortions up to  weeks. After my experience, I think the abortion limit should be lower, or at least the limit should be lowered for when they will resuscitate a premature baby to  weeks. At the moment, although most abortions in England, Wales and Scotland are carried out earlier, according to the NHS, the legal limit is  weeks, with the limit being raised in some exceptional circumstances, like the mothers le being at risk, or the child being born with very severe disabilities.  When Anita, who also has two daughters, Olivia, eight, and Marion, five, felt feverish after completing a long sht as an intensive care nurse on June , , she thought nothing of it. Going to bed, she woke in the early hours and, feeling achy and unwell, she took a paracetamol and hoped the pain would subside. Then at am, she woke again and knew at once that she was in labour. She said: “I’d already had two children, so knew exactly what the feeling was. I was having contractions. “I went downstairs and walked around for a bit, praying I wasn’t having the baby.” Ringing her dad, Alan Bull, , who lived three miles away in Rochford, Essex, he advised her to wake her sleeping husband and call the hospital.  Leaving Alan to look after their daughters, terried Dan and Anita drove to Southend University Hospital. “We wanted this baby so badly, as Id miscarried before,” Anita said, recalling how she had lost a child at nine weeks in December  - making William even more precious. Suffering with polycystic oy syndrome, causing sufferers to develop oian cysts because of hormonal imbalances making conception a challenge, she also had an underactive thyroid. Together, these conditions had made falling pregnant dficult, and she had taken the fertility drug metformin to improve her rate of ovulation before conceiving both daughters. Already amazed to have conceived this time without assistance, when William Sidney Hyams arrived weighing just lb oz - the equivalent of two thirds of a bag of sugar - at .pm on June , she and Dan were astonished.  Luckily, he took a breath on his own and he was then given oxygen tubes to help him breath. He was immediately whisked away to the special care baby unit, before Anita even had chance to see him. “I saw William for the first time at three hours old,” she said. “I was scared to even touch him, because he was so tiny, just the size of my hand. “But it was like looking at a little miracle. He was fully formed, but not completely developed. “All his fingers and toes were there, he was just like a miniature version of a baby.”  Transferred to the more specialist Royal London Hospital in east London that night, William was looked after in the neonatal intensive care unit for  days. Visiting their lad and watching him go from strength to strength every day, Anita, Dan and their daughters stayed in Stevenson House for the duration. The free accommodation for families with unwell children is run by national charity The Sick Children’s Trust, which supports , children a year. “We stayed with him as much as we could and read to him every day,” said Anita. “He got stronger every day and, on August , was taken back to Southend University Hospital, as he had made so much progress.”  Eventually, the family took William home on October  - just eight days after his official due date of September . Anita continued: “His sisters adore him and are like two extra little mummies to him. “I still feel so emotional talking about it all. He is so full of smiles and le. He can sit up on his own, but can’t crawl just yet. I know hell get there, though. “And Im just so grateful that he’s here.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mums plea find cure rare","story":"NewsMums plea to find cure for rare disease that makes daughter look like she’s been punched repeatedlyAt first doctors thought Betsy was having an allergic reaction to something but it soon became clear it was much more seriousShareCommentsByAmanda Keenan:,  OCT NewsKerry and John Blakey with daughter Betsy \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum has made a desperate plea to find a cure for a rare le-threatening disease that makes her young daughter swell to twice her size and look like she’s been punched repeatedly. Three-year-old Betsy was rushed to her GP by mum Kerry Blakey when her face, legs and arms ballooned so much that she was forced to cut her clothes off with scissors.The youngster was originally shydiagnosed with a sinus condition but as her health continued to deteriorate, her parents took her to hospital for a second opinion, reports the Daily Record . Tests found a high level of protein in her body and she was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, which causes the kidneys to leak protein – and affects only seven in a million people. The condition causes Betsy’s organs and body tissue to puff up and bruise. The youngster’s immune system is also badly affected, putting her at greater risk of catching dangerous infections. Kerry said: “When her body swells up it looks like she’s been punched shyrepeatedly in the face. “Her eyes can become very painful and look like they are closed, even though they are open. The only way to get her clothes off is to cut them with scissors as she actually doubles in size. “Doctors say they have never seen anything like it. Betsy spent  days in quarantine in hospital as they tried to find out what was wrong. At first they thought it was an allergic reaction to something she’d eaten but it soon became clear it was much more serious. “When we were finally given a diagnosis last October it came as a complete shock. “We had to quickly learn everything about it. Her kidneys don’t work shyproperly and filter out all of the good stuff as well as the bad.”  Kerry, , and husband John, , who are also parents to six-year-old Bobby, were then told there’s currently no cure. It can be treated with steroids for a period but this can affect Betsy’s bone marrow and growth. Kerry, from Perth, said: “It’s a very serious illness and one that takes many dferent paths. Our only hope is to use steroids to help plug the holes in Betsy’s kidneys and stop them from leaking. “But the problem with this type of medication is it’s really toxic – and she’s had nine doses of it already. The doctors are now worried about the toll it will take on her wee body as it can affect her eyes, growth and bone marrow. She’s now on what they call a second line medicine, which is shybasically a chemo drug, albeit a very small dose. “The hope is that this will work but we will have to wait and see. “It’s horrible watching her go through this and awful not knowing what is going to happen next.” Despite everything she has to endure, Betsy always sports a big smile and loves playing in the park.

So news that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting their first child has been greeted with happiness, getting royal fans extremely excited.As youd expect, there are lots of royal rules and protocol theyll have to follow now theyve decided to start a family, as with all aspects of their lives. And its not just parenthood which comes with royal traditions - the pregnancy has them, too. Prince William and Kate Middleton had to follow the rulesand now its Harry and Meghans turn.  Meghan probably wont have a baby shower Its a popular tradition in the UK and the US for friends and family of the expectant mum to thrown them a baby shower, with fun games and presents. But ABC News expert Victoria Arbiter said baby showers werent common in the royal family. She said: They are clearly very wealthy, and a lavish baby shower would be seen as highly inappropriate. Theres nothing they cant go out and buy themselves. However there are reports that Kate Middletons sister Pippa threw her a baby shower when she was pregnant with George. Overseas travel is limited All pregnant women are advised to avoid flying at the end of their pregnancy, and many airlines wont actually let them. But for the royals, this is much more strict and travel throughout the entire pregnancy is frowned upon. This probably wasnt a huge set-back for Kate and other pregnant women before her, but almost all of Meghans family and friends live in America or Canada. According to the Sun , pregnant royals are advised to keep travelling abroad to a minimum for safety reasons. We didnt see Kate made as many overseas visits during when she was expecting, although she did go on a royal tour of Sweden and Norway when she was caring Prince Louis.  Not one to follow the rules, Meghan and Harry actually announced their pregnancy while they were on the other side of the world. The happy news came from Kensington Palace hours after the Duke and Duchess touched down in Sydney to start their tour of Australia, New Zealand and South Pacic islands.Perhaps this is a sign they will also flout the travel ban for the rest of Meghans pregnancy  The sex will be a top guarded secret The gender of a royal baby isnt revealed until he or she makes their big arrival. Kate and Wills havent known for any of their three children, even though people believed they dropped several hints during the pregnany. A source told E! News : William and Kate dont know the sex of the baby, so theyre rather looking forward to finding out. Its very dficult to be totally prepared when you dont knowits going to be a boy or a girl. A HUGE maternity team - who have to give up booze When Kate gave birth she had a massive team on hand to make sure everything went smoothly. Her dream team comprised of two obstetricians, three midwives, three anesthesiologists, four surgical staff members, two special care staffers, four pediatricians, one lab technician for blood tests, and three or four managers.  The team met once a month to discuss the pregnancy at every dferent stage. And they had to give up a lot. They were on call for three months before her due date - and they werent allowed to drink during this period. The birth announcement When Baby Sussex does finally arrive, there will be no messaging family on WhatsApp or posting on Facebook to tell people about the new member of the family. As with Prince William and Kate Middleton, the announcement is likely to be displayed on an easel outside Buckingham Palace. Historically, the announcement was hand-written by the doctor immediately after birth and sent in a car to the palace to let the public know the babys gender.

Harry and Meghan will be visiting Fiji and Tonga, which have both had outbreaks of the Zika virus and pose potential risks to unborn children.

Many children die from the condition, which can cause severe brain damage. In Brazil, where Zika is also present, more than , babies have been born with shrunken heads after contracting the virus from their mothers. The NHS website advises anyone travelling to Fiji and Tonga to practise strict mosquito bite avoidance at all times. They also recommend nobody travels without adequate insurance and that they seek health advice before setting off.  Pregnant women are advised by the health service to consider postponing any non-essential travel. But its not just Meghan at risk.

In front of the congregation and the millions of viewers who watched in wonder, Harry could not contain his glee as the Dean of Windsor stood before the couple and spoke about the institution of marriage as “the foundation of family le in which children are born and nurtured”. Dean David Conner said: “The gt of marriage brings husband and we together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives.  “It is given as the foundation of family le in which children are born and nurtured and in which each member of the family, in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love.” As the word “children” was uttered, Harry, , turned to Meghan, , and smiled.  A Royal source said: “Harry was bursting with pride the whole ceremony but it was that reaction that caught the eye of those who know him best. It was beautul and subtle nod to the hope they both have that they will become parents as soon as possible.” Royal biographer Andrew Morton, who researched the new Duchess of Sussex’s le while writing a book about her, also said he expected Harry and Meghan to bring a baby into the world soon.

The Foreign Office has put out an urgent warning over Putin’s spooks’ tactics. A memo states: “Russian services regard them as high-priority targets.” Putin’s ruthless shycampaign to recruit traitors from Britain comes as he tries to appear strong at home, experts say. The Russian President is under growing pressure amid a flagging economy and recent blunders by his GRU intelligence agency – including the botched novichok attack in Salisbury. A former British intelligence officer told the Mirror: “The perceived threat Putin wants to portray to Russians is that the West is surrounding them and that his motherland is a victim.  “Whilst all the time he can smirk at the suggestion the GRU has been trying to disrupt Western democracies, the blunders his men have made are becoming embarrassing. His intelligence agencies are desperate to claw back credibility by making inroads into shyBritain’s intelligence operations by recruiting insiders.” Such is the escalating campaign by Moscow’s spooks that Foreign Office officials have sent out an urgent warning to ex-MI staff and diplomats. The memo, leaked to the Mirror, states loved ones could be threatened.  It says: “Russian services regard both current and former retired members of the service as high-priority targets. Russian services have a tradition of using pressure in their operations. This may be used against both former members of staff and close relations.” Russian spies use a iety of techniques to coerce people into becoming agents or disclosing secrets, ranging from blatant threats of violence to subtle persuasion. Behind the scenes for years, Moscow’s spooks have become increasingly aggressive towards Western diplomats, sometimes resorting to violence. The Mirror understands several US staff have been beaten up by Russian thugs on the intelligence agency payroll. Some have also had their homes burgled.  One security source said: “This is an intimidation tactic, it breeds insecurity, builds up tension and is considered a breach in the professional standards of the intelligence community.” The Foreign Office declined to comment on the memo. Tensions between Russia and Britain escalated in March with the novichok nerve agent attack by GRU operatives Anatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin on former Kremlin intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and daughter Yulia. Twelve GRU men have also been indicted with hacking the US election. There are few known examples of Britons becoming Russian spies. However, one is still alive. George Blake, , turned on being captured during the Korean War. In  he was jailed for being a KGB double agent. He escaped in  and fled to the Soviet Union. In  he was awarded the Order of Friendship by Putin.Spies involved in novichok-style attacks will face EU sanctions including asset-freezing and travel bans, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will say today.Ex-spooks are vulnerable and there are plenty of targetsANALYSIS By Chris HughesBritish intelligence agencies have doubled in size in the past  years and many officers serve for under  years. This means there is a huge pool of Brits with sensitive information. Ex-spies will know operational details of MI missions against Russia, names of spies and double agents and new spying techniques. Diplomats may have data on ex-colleagues, Government plans and commercially sensitive projects. All of this can be used to give Russia the upper hand – making former staff vulnerable. Particularly at risk are new businesses set up by former Government workers, needing cash to get started. The really dficult area is security, where many ex-spooks go to earn decent money. Russians throwing cash at these companies to perform due diligence checks on employees or other small projects can mask their real intentions. Gradually, people can be sucked in until they are compromised and find it hard to turn down lucrative contracts or refuse to work with someone they suddenly suspect is on the payroll of the Kremlin. It is in this area that Russia has been particularly aggressive – trying to employ British intelligence firms to find out information about iniduals. There are many ways Russia can subtly recruit someone. Sometimes they can do it and the target does not realise until it is too late. Other times a more direct approach is used – or even blackmail.

Many parents have expressed their anger at the voting forms, branding them a type of bullying and were calling on the school to ditch the awards, designed for inclusion in a yearbook.Staff at the school are aware of the complaints and have since suspended the yearbook until further notice, reports Derbyshire Live . Jane Gretton, who has a -year-old daughter at the school, said: I am absolutely appalled by these voting slips, it is more like something out of an American school and to me it is just another form of bullying. To be asking questions like who has the best bum at that age is just ridiculous. They are young people andthere are children at the school who have hang ups over their body or their personality, then it could affect their mental heath in the fuutre. I thought schools were meant to be stopping this sort of thing. It is ridiculous and inappropriate.  Having said all this, I think Highfields is a fantastic school. I have had two children who were there right up to A-level and are doing really well because of what they learnt at the school. These awards are not right though and I hope they are stopped. Award categories included most likely to become Prime Minister, sportiest, funniest, friendliest and those most likely to become a millionaire or be late to their own wedding Parents have fumed though as the awards also include best bum, flirtiest, most lovable rogue, teachers pet and best looking. Many parents have also taken to Facebook to complain about the voting forms.

So imagine a two-year-old so affected by his early le he won’t ask for food, no matter how hungry he gets. That was the reality when Jay came to his foster family two years ago. A small boy who would sit in the corner of a room, too nervous to let anyone touch him.  Now Jay is unrecognisable from that child, a smiling, happy four-year-old and testament to just what a dference having a loving home can make. Foster carer Bukky, , recalls: “When he first came he was very, very withdrawn. He wouldn’t ask for food. If we let him, he could have gone all day without eating, that was normal for him. He was very quiet, very shy. The first three days he wouldn’t let me touch him. “He’d just sit in the corner on his own. By the fourth day he was with us I couldn’t handle it any more. I had to be able to pick him up, hold him. And very slowly, he began to open up to me. “But now, he’s come out of all that. And he’ll tell me when he’s hungry and enjoys food – especially any African food – he’s now in a comfortable place.”  Bukky, who also fosters a little girl, recalls the first time Jay allowed her to hug him. She says: “At the beginning, he was still pushing away from me, it was hard. But soon he understood that I was there to care for him. I was there to feed him, bathe him, give him all he needs. “Then he slowly understood I was there to care, not to harm him. “He started to open up very quickly and would then latch on to me. No one  could carry him!” When I arrive, Jay, who is eating a snack at the kitchen table, flashes a cheeky smile and gives a little wave – a sign of how far he has come. In the last two years, he has blossomed into a happy, confident little boy, but he desperately needs a permanent family to adopt him. Jay is one of thousands of children across the UK waiting to find their forever home and the authorities are appealing for prospective families to come forward in the hope they will find someone to adopt him. As Bukky recalls his first month at her home in London, Jay is playing happily with his toy police car at our feet. It is hard to imagine him as a timid little boy as he happily shows off his favourite toys. He takes me up into his bedroom, where his toy cars are neatly in a row. His favourite is his police car, which has blue flashing lights and a siren. Ask Jay what he wants to be when he grows up and elements of that shy personality are still apparent, but it is adorable. He runs up to Bukky, whispers in her ear, “a policeman” and runs back to his toy car. “He also says he wants to be a fireman and a doctor”, Bukky laughs. Jay is in reception class at school and is settling in well, especially with reading and writing.  Bukky says: “His teachers adore him and he gets on well with the other children. He’s very sociable, quiet at times, very caring. Above all, Jay loves to read. We read every day. “Before school, I’d take him to the library every week.” But Jay also enjoys making the most of the outdoors as well as being in the classroom. Bukky adds: “Jay just loves to dance, he loves to run, and I take him to the park as much as I can.” And one of the other things Jay prides himself on is his appearance. Laughing, Bukky says: “He loves getting his hair done. He used to have long hair. “We cut it about three months ago and he loves it. It was the funniest thing though, the first time we had his hair cut, we went to a specic barber. But when we took him the second time, my husband took him to his own barber’s. “But Jay said, ‘No! I already have my own barber!’ We all laughed a lot. He’s very sure of himself when it comes to his presentation and he knows what he wants.”  One of the most noticeable things about Jay – evident from meeting him just once – is his kind and loving nature, the way he keeps running up to his foster mum and gently giving her a cuddle, how polite he is when meeting new people. Bukky says: “When we got rid of his buggy because he was too big for it, he’d say, ‘Can we give it to another mummy with a baby ’ That’s the kind of thoughtful boy he is and that’s all him. He is naturally caring. “He just has the loveliest nature.” Even though Jay has matured into a positive little boy, he still has moments where he will keep to himself. Bukky says: “Because of everything he’s gone through, Jay needs a lot of love, someone that has time for him that really, really loves him. “He can be a child who sometimes keeps to himself, he will go back into his cocoon sometimes. He needs someone who will draw him out. “Jay needs that attention and love, someone who will speak to him when he wants to talk. He’s a deep thinker and very, very thoughtful.” Bukky says Jay has brought her so much joy and her family will miss him. She says: “From the day he stepped in, it has been an absolute joy. I will always think of him as a blessing. All you have to do is look at that smile.” * If you are interested in adopting Jay, call    or visit www.firstadoption.org.uk There are THREE TIMES more children than adopters Children who are desperate for “forever families” face a crisis, with almost three times as many of them as there are adopters. There are , children in England with an adoption order and just  families approved to adopt, research by national adoption information service FirstAdoption found.

The Mirror has partnered with FirstAdoption for National Adoption Week to help find them new homes. FirstAdoption’s Gemma Gordon-Johnson said: “These figures show an urgent need to find the right families for vulnerable children. “Many experience neglect or abuse, struggle to trust adults, have complex health needs or are slow to meet developmental milestones. “There are also children born into violent homes who witness things no child should see. “Adoption is a lelong commitment and it takes a special kind of person. “But being placed into a safe and loving family can dramatically transform these children’s lives. “If you think you have what it takes visit HERE.” "},{"url":null,"title":"subtle way fergies status within","story":"NewsSubtle way Fergies status within royal family is evident in Eugenies official wedding photos, claims expertOne body language expert says a subtle exclusion zone could be seen around the Duchess of York during her daughters weddingShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video fergie-arrives-audacious-hat-eugenies-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrincess Eugenie looked a picture-perfect bride as she tied the knot with husband Jack Brooksbank on Friday.

Thatcher Grayson, who has non-verbal autism and is unable to speak, couldnt tell his mum Jo what happened at school so she demanded to see the CCTV footage. Mrs Grayson had earlier received a text from her sons teacher at Tates Creek Middle School in Lexington, Kentucky, US. The text read: The nurse and I had to physically help him get up off the gym floor. He wouldnt move and other kids were trying to play. I apologisehe has marks on him.  Not realising the seriousness of the situation, his mum thanked the teacher for letting her know. But when her son got undressed in the evening, she was shocked by the marks on his body and went to school the next morning demanding answers. Mrs Grayson told CNN: We were getting ready for bed, and when I pulled his shirt off, I saw cuts and bruises on his body. That didnt look like marks of someone helping him get up. In the surveillance tape a school nurse and teacher can be seen dragging the boy, who is closely followed by his service dog. The mum told ABC news: I don’t understand how anybody could do that to any child, regardless of whether or not they have a disability. “I was initially told that he was having a meltdown, but the truth is, he wasn’t having a meltdown.  In the footage, Thacther is pulled along a hallway and up some stairs, before being dragged into another communal space. Mrs Grayson has filed a report with the district attorney, but to date no arrests have been made. However, according to CNN, the teacher no longer works at the school and the nurse has been placed in leave, pending investigation. In a statement, Lisa Deffendall, a spokeswoman for the school district, said: There is absolutely no tolerance for the conduct of the employee in this incident, and while we cannot discuss specics, we do want to reassure our families that we take any situations of this nature very seriously.  Our training is very explicit that physical restraint is a last resort only to be used when a student is a danger to themselves or others. The training also shows employees the proper ways to hold or transport students. In this case, neither of those standards were met.

Mekuli had broken into the property through the window and presumably wanted to remove any evidence of his presence. The teenager from Hamilton on New Zealands North Island has been sentenced to an eight year stretch behind bars.  He appeared in Hamilton District Court last Friday where he faced charges for rape, threatening to kill, sexual violation, attempted kidnapping, burglary and assault on a child.The -year-old victim told the NZ Herald she was really disappointed with the sentence as its hard to live a normal le following the ordeal.She said: He almost killed me and he almost killed my daughter.

Defence counsel Sacha Nepe argued for a lower sentence as the teenager endured a tough childhood involving domestic violence and drug use. Mekuli, who showed no remorse for his victim, was sentenced to eight years in jail as the judge allowed a % discount for a guilty plea and his youth.

He followed them on to the steps outside and asked them to pause for a picture as they gingerly clutched sacred wooden statuettes salvaged by Pere Leon Peulmeule from the debris scattered over the aisle. The soldiers stared sternly at the man with the camera and then followed the priest’s directions to a place where the mahogany icons would be protected. It was a moment McLellan, , thought deserving of posterity amid the chaos of the First World War in . His photographer’s instinct was right. A century later, the Daily Mirror has gone back to Armentieres and found the five statuettes have been perfectly preserved. Last week I visited the reconstructed Saint-Vaast church and found the same figures of saints on shelves in a side chapel. In a little-used corridor they are like silent sentries, survivors from the town’s darkest hour.  Even though  years have passed, today’s parishioners are well aware of the bravery of the British soldiers back in . They know that after the moment frozen in time in the photograph the British troops went back to an uncertain fate on the frontline. Saint-Vaast church meanwhile was pummelled by further intense shelling in attacks that ultimately failed to shatter Allied resistance. Accompanied by the current priest, Abbe Luc Lesage, the faithful were pleased to recreate such a symbolic event for one of McLellan’s successors - Daily Mirror photographer Phil Coburn - as they finished mass. Sylvie Duclercq, , said: “It’s incredible that these statues survived after what happened at the time, just extraordinary. The church itself was completely ruined. The roof was blown off completely, making the building unusable. “For us it is amazing that this picture exists which shows how the statues were saved. Thanks to the photographer from the Daily Mirror the people of Armentieres will always have this memory of what took place in .” Today Saint-Vaast is a magnicent edice that stands proud in the heart of Armentieres, which was right on the frontline when the photograph was taken in February . By the time German forces took it during their Spring Offensive, aimed at pushing British isions back and cutting off supply lines to the English Channel, it was mostly rubble. There are reminders of the First World War wherever you go, on giant posters throughout the town, and in a copy of McLellan’s photograph pinned to the church noticeboard.  In the last  months of the First World War no other photographer depicted the most signicant events so thoroughly as David McLellan. After a transfer from the Royal Flying Corps, he was appointed as an official war photographer in December  along with another Daily Mirror snapper, Tom Aitken. One of only five official photographers working on the Western Front, his work was noted for the way it captured the immense scale of operations as Allied forces engaged in vital rearguard actions and offensives that eventually led to the Armistice of November . What makes the images remarkable is that all of them had to be submitted to Army generals for censorship before publication as part of his photographer’s permit. When the Allies broke through the German defensive lines in the autumn of  in what became the final big push, McLellan made sure he was there. He travelled with the troops as they breached the Canal de Saint-Quentin, one of the most heavily fortied stretches of the Hindenberg Line. The assault had been preceded by the greatest British artillery bombardment of the war, in which more than one million shells were fired in a short period of time.  Such was the ferocity of the onslaught that the enemy soldiers were pinned in their dugouts. In early October  the troops of the North Staffordshire Regiment seized the strategically vital Riqueval Bridge before the Germans had a chance to fire their explosive charges. Thousands of prisoners were taken by British, American and Australian soldiers. They also managed to gain control of a key tunnel on the canal, a short walk from Riqueval, which had been turned into a fortress complete with kitchens and field hospitals. The triumph at Saint-Quentin became one of the most signicant victories of the war, and a moment to be captured on camera. Several thousand British soldiers sat on what had, until the day before, been the German-controlled eastern bank opposite as Brigadier General JV Campbell addressed them from the bridge. They were like tiny ants on the high earth bank, which had been raised by the Germans for deep trenches dug behind. Such a gathering of so many infantrymen in the same place at the same time was a rare spectacle.  Many of the them were smiling and wore le jackets having swam or got across the canal in the flotation devices. Once again McLellan recognised such a striking image. The photograph resonated with the generals as brilliant propaganda to show the public back home. It proved that after four appalling years, progress was slowly being made. Having broken through at Riqueval, the Allied forces were able to advance, eventually bringing about the Armistice ceasefire. Thousands more men came over the bridge, including poet Wilfred Owen with the Manchester Regiment. Conditions at Riqueval when I visited last week could not have been more dferent. There was birdsong instead of gunfire, shards of sunlight hitting the still water and where there were once soldiers there are now trees. But the evidence of what once happened here was all around. On the bridge I met three local young men with metal detectors and a bag containing their haul from the morning – shrapnel, shell casings and even the remnants of a German soldier’s identity tag. Raphael Plancot, , said: “The ground here is full of First World War ordnance. We come here all the time and find things. Millions of bombs landed here. When the sun is shining you can see the shells glinting on the bed of the canal.” After Riqueval McLellan stayed with the Allied armies as they surged forwards. His work now forms an important part of the archives kept for future generations, including those at the Imperial War Museum and the National Library of Scotland. Not only did he show British soldiers in battle, he also showed what was going on behind the lines – the men, women and children whose lives were forever changed. He portrayed the daily lives of soldiers in the trenches, the first use of tanks across no man’s land, gas attacks and even the brief of interludes of peace when the guns fell silent.

There should be some kind of shuttle bus service to take people directly to the car park from the hospital entrance.“You have to stop in the dark and look for money to get a parking ticket – that is a safety concern.”Steven McDonald, , a construction worker from Perth, said: “If it’s dark it should be lit up, especiallyyou’re paying for it. People could trip and fall.”Louise Davidson, , from Menzieshill, said: “If there’s no light, anyone could be creeping around.”Bob McGlashan, senior officer for the Royal College of Nursing, stressed that safety is paramount and called for anyone experiencing any issues to come forward.Indigo, which operates the car park, declined to comment on the issue.The concerns raised come as support continues to flood in for the Tele’s petition calling for Indigo to freeze parking fees.Indigo is locked in a -year contract with NHS Tayside to run all the Ninewells Hospital car parks.Fees have been rising constantly in recent years, meaning people who attend the hospital through necessity are having to fork out more and more.The firm plans to raise the costs again, so day tickets will go up to

are unhappy he was handling the proceedings despite his father, Stewart, making over  appearances for the Rugby Parkers between  and .To add to the conspiracy theories, for  years he was a team-mate of Paul Clarke – brother of their current boss Steve.The pair even appeared on the same sticker in an edition of the annual Panini football album.All that’s prompted the Dundee Supporters’ Association to write to SFA head of referees’ committee chairman Willie Young and their head of refereeing, John Fleming, to question the sense behind having McLean taking games involving Kilmarnock.“Several of our members have contacted me to express their concerns over this and we think it’s only right to pass them on to the authorities,” said DSA chairman Kenny Ross.“And I do think there is reason to question the validity of this appointment when the referee so clearly has family connections to Kilmarnock.“If nothing  it puts him in a dficult position when you get a decision like Saturday’s.“I know that Steven McLean’s brother Brian played for Dundee United, Ross County and a few other clubs and he was not allowed to take charge of games involving teams he was at.“You think the same common sense approach could have been applied to his dad’s old team.”The fans also pointed out should the Killie player who ed to win the kick, Jordan Jones, be handed a two-game ban, that in itself could damage Dundee.The games he would miss would be against St Mirren and Hamilton, the two sides immediately above the Dark Blues at the foot of the Premiership.SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell was copied

thought he was arrogant because he never spoke but when he eventually decided to chat to me I thought to myself, ‘oh, I quite like him’.”Kevin, originally from St Mary’s, added: “I had noticed Dawn before and was definitely interested in her. That is probably why I never talked as I was nervous.”When a colleague found out about the mutual interest, she channelled her inner Cilla Black and set them up.After their first date, Kevin and Dawn were inseparable and within six months they were engaged and living together.Kevin said: “We had been shopping one day and Dawn pointed out an engagement ring that she loved as it was so unique.“I waited until she went into another shop and went back to the jewellers and bought it.“That was in August and it was meant to be her Christmas present but I couldn’t keep it a secret so I got down on one knee in the house.“Dawn said yes straight away, despite being a bit shocked.”After the y engagement, a barbecue and a few drinks this summer led to the frequently asked question from the couple’s pals: “When are you two going to get married ”.With a holiday booked for September, the bride-to-be joked: “Who knows, maybe we will just do it while we are off.”Kevin decided to move things on and booked the registrar’s office for September  – just five weeks later.Dawn said: “Once the date was confirmed, it was mayhem.“We were offered a vintage bus as our transport by Tay Bus Vintage Vehicle Society and I was really up for it but Kevin point-blank refused. We then realised that our wedding day coincided with the opening of the VA so the only way we were getting to our wedding was on the bus driven by our good friend Stevie Reid. He was amazing all day and acted like our taxi driver.“I am so glad now that we had the bus as it was such a laugh.“We got some funny looks driving down the dual carriageway in it.“Everyone on the streets was waving and my bridesmaid Jenner Turner started a confetti fight.“I had my bus driver head on and told her she couldn’t do it but when she asked Stevie he just laughed and it turned into confetti chaos. It was amazing.”Kevin added: “Although I didn’t want the bus to begin with, I was so happy with it on the day. It was very cool and a great laugh.”Kevin was joined by pal Paul Turner as best man, admitting he has too many male family members to have had to choose from them.The couple said “I do” in the registrar’s office in the city centre before having a meal with close family and friends and hitting the Fairmuir clubbie at night for an unofficial reception.Dawn said: “One of Kevin’s sons lives in Australia and couldn’t make it to the wedding so we decided we would wait until he is home next year before having a reception.“Instead we went to the Fairmuir clubbie, where we go every week, and they made it so special. Even the band, Scotland Rocks, pulled us up on to the dancefloor and gave us a first dance. I can’t thank the club enough for making it an even more special day.”The happy couple would also like to thank good friend and former colleague Gordon Baird for his photography skills, David Murdoch who created the wedding cake and Flowers by Dawn who made the bouquets.Dawn added: “I may have only had five weeks to organise the day but I wouldn’t change a thing.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bc060ac5341d.jpg ","title":"dundee people walk in memory of laura","story":"The NHS Tayside Continence Advisory and Treatment Service took part in a team sponsored walk around Fe to raise funds in memory of nursing colleague Laura Balfour, who died of septicaemia.The charity FEAT was founded in memory of Falkirk based GP Dr Fiona Agnew and her baby daughter Isla, who both died after contracting sepsis in August .FEAT aims to stop sepsis through funding research into the early detection of the condition and raising awareness of the illness.Lisa Henry, specialist nurse at Wallacetown Health Centre in Dundee, said: “Laura’s colleagues past and present attended the walk and wore bright colours to remember her by.“The sun was shining on the day and everyone who participated was glad to support Laura’s family in raising awareness and funds for septicaemia in her memory.”The team, pictured, raised £, in total.

says property expert","story":"Now is the best time to buy property in Aberdeen for  years, according to new research.Aberdein Considine says buyers and investors from other parts of the UK are ing to the north-east market as the energy industry emerges from one of the most testing downturns in its history.Robert Fraser, senior property partner at the law firm, believes the current market is the best property buyers have experienced in two decades – saying that people can now get a two-bed flat for the same price as a one-bed in .He said: “It’s really taking a pragmatic approach and looking historically at what the correlation is with oil and gas in the north-east and matching up that with the property prices over the same period.“You can see how closely the property prices follow the local economy rather than the national economy.“Since the oil price crash of -, when the Brent Crude benchmark dropped to under , we have seen a gradual decline in average sales in both Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.#So far this year, the average sale price in Aberdeen alone is £,, down around % on the  peak.“However, with oil now sitting above  again – and suggestions that global events could push it higher – savvy buyers and investors are ing to the market in Aberdeen.”The law firm believes first-time buyers should take advantage of lower prices amid warnings that a new skills shortage in the industry could trigger a similar worker influx to the one which almost doubled average property values in the late s and s.Mr Fraser says the city is more likely to see a “sustained growth” going forward rather than a property “boom”, adding that the firm is already seeing ato the market of some long-term investors and landlords, including those from overseas.He said: “It’s safe to say on a local level we are through the worst of the recession and we are now seeing the recovery of the oil price and historically that has shown to lead to an increase in house prices.”The UK Government’s Oil and Gas Authority said in its most recent report that the cost-cutting which has seen thousands of jobs lost in the sector “may now be over”.North Sea operators are also expected to generate a £ billion cash surplus this year – the highest figure achieved since  when the industry was enjoying a boom.At the  market peak, there were around , properties on the market at any time within the city.That number sits at more than , today, with a particular oversupply of city centre flats.This has created a buyers’ market where properties are changing hands for below home report value in many cases, according to the law firm.Mr Fraser added the situation has occurred down to “supply and demand”.He said: “At the moment we have huge supply with what has been a more limited demand but gradually that will rebalance.“It may possibly get to a stage full circle again back to what we are used to in Aberdeen with over-demand and less properties.“These conditions are rare in the north-east – I haven’t seen a market like it since  after the last real oil dip – andhistory is to be repeated, then people buying at the moment are likely to see a substantialon investment over the next five to  years.”"},{"url":null,"title":"section of busy aberdeen road to shut for resurfacing work1","story":"Part of a busy Aberdeen road is to close for six days to carry out resurfacing

side were “perpetrators of their own mistakes” after they lost - to Portugal at HampdenDespite a decent enough first- half where Scotland showed they could create half-chances against the Portuguese second string, in reality the visitors cruised to victory.Even with a late first-half tap-in for Helder Costa, the Scots showed intent after the break to level the game.They didn’t have any luck though, and after a quiet spell where Portugal knocked the ball around their own half, Eder ghosted in to bullet a header past keeper Craig Gordon before Bruma curled home another.The latter two goals were mistakes on the Scots’ part.There was a late Steven Naismith consolation, with Aberdeen’s Gary Mackay-Steven providing a backheeled assist, but the Dark Blues’ performance against one of Europe’s top teams lacked cutting edge.After Thursday night’s disappointing UEFA Nations League loss to Israel in Haa, there may now be increased concerns for the Scots’ ability to top their pool and hold on to another shot at qualying for Euro .McLeish claimed his squad will have been lted by their showing against Portugal.McLeish, who pointed to the - loss to Belgium last month as playing out in a similar way to last night, said: “We shot ourselves in the foot against the two top teams, Belgium and Portugal, it was basic errors we made. That’s the disappointing aspect of it.“The top teams will cut through you with majestic skill and leave you trailing but we were the perpetrators of our own mistakes.“I thought we played , there was a lot of good football, we had a good gameplan, the structure of it, we were compact and we pressed when we tried to press. We stayed high on the goalkicks and we tried to build ourselves.“We knew we were playing against top quality players, and I know there were Portugal players rested but there was still a hell of a lot of money out on that pitch.”McLeish switched to four at the back after a lot of criticism about the three centre-backs used during his second reign as national boss, which has left some players out of their usual club positions. Something which was widely blamed for the Scots’ chaotic defending against Israelis.He used a centre-back pairing of Celtic’s Jack Hendry and Aberdeen’s Scott McKenna against the Portuguese.Of the change in set-up, McLeish said: “We want to adapt to certain formations. The Russians in the World Cup played four at the back and in certain games they played three. It’s about getting the right balance. For the Albania gameitreally worked.”However, McLeish refused to rule out reverting to three centre-backs for the next Nations League clash – a must-win away to the Albanians before Israel visit Hampden – although he will be looking to set-up for a much better performance than the two losses on Thursday and last night.Asked whether he was concerned over repeated defensive errors costing his team goals, he pointed to the youth of the Scotland stoppers and said his whole team reduced the amount of risks they were taking.He said: “There’s young players there, a lot of them are learning their trade. Some came in during the summer when we needed new recruits.“It’s not easy for guys to come in and be top internationals within three or four caps.”McLeish went on to use Northern Ireland’s Michael O’Neill as an example of a boss who has gone on to great success after a testing opening spell in charge of their country, saying he is “resilient” enough to maintain his self-belief he can lead Scotland back to success.The boss also refused to say whether he expected Celtic’s Leigh Grfiths, who ruled himself out of the squad amid reports he was unhappy at being left on the bench in the last game against Albania, to be back.McLeish said: “I had a chat with Leigh last week and he said physically he had to get better. That’s his choice.“I admire him for that and he wants to get to a level of fitness where he can blow Brendanaway and blow the nation away.”He added: “I’d love to see anybody in the squad who’s scoring loads of goals, who looks a real threat and is at his full sharpness.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 34","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.There was some suspicion over the intentions of health and social care managers at the recent meeting of Mid Argyll Health and Care Forum .Members felt their recent behaviour might be a precursor to changing the forum set-up to make it saferand more homogenised across the region.But there was also strong feeling the HCF should be better attended by public representatives such as community councillors.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run.

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked. Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it. The Facebook page, which has gained a following of over  people in one week, hopes to attract the attention of nightclubs and bars and is aiming for lids to be put on all drinks served at their bars as part of a drive to stop people having their drinks spiked.  Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"dyslexia-support-to-be-rolled-out-to-every-school-in-the-borders","story":"SUPPORTING students with dyslexia in Borders schools is being made a priority by Scottish Borders Council.The local authoritys ruling Executive has agreed to the adoption of a dyslexia policy which will be made available in every primary and secondary.The policy has been developed following widespread consultation with parents, parent councils, pupils and staff with the aim of providing a very clear and robust framework that will give schools the strategies and approaches they need to support children.It is supported by a comprehensive set of operational guidelines and a training programme for staff that will ensure a consistent experience for all children and young people living in the Scottish Borders.Councillor Carol Hamilton, Executive member for Children and Young People said: ldquoThe formal adoption of this policy is a vital part of our ongoing commitment to making sure that all children and young people in the Borders experience consistently high standards of practice and support, in this particular case for those for whom dyslexia is a part of their daily lives.\"Dyslexia can have a profound impact on a child or young personrsquos feelings and confidence.\"It is therefore crucial that all our pupils who have dyslexia are identied in a timely way and are provided with appropriate support to ensure that they do not lose confidence in their ability to succeed.\"We are confident that the approach set out in the policy will ensure that these pupils have access to trained and knowledgeable staff who are aware of their responsibilities and know how to make sure that any relevant interventions and adaptations are put in place."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-railway-ignored-in-national-scotrail-improvements","story":"TRAIN bosses have defended the Borders RAILWAY being ignored this week in a major timetable improvement plan.Despite the Waverley-to-Tweedbank line being widely welcomed since re-opening three years ago it has been blighted by overcrowding, cancellations and delays.This week operators ScotRail announced details of faster journeys, more seats, and more services being introduced across most of the country in December.More carriages are being added to lines in East Lothian, the central belt and Strathclyde.And new electric trains with more seats are being introduced to lines around Falkirk, Dunblane, Alloa and Edinburgh.There will also be additional trains across the central belt, Tayside and the Highlands.But the Borders Railway hasnt been included in any of this weeks announced upgrades.Local MP John Lamont is among the many who have been left disappointed.He said: \"These new announcements from ScotRail are disappointing, but are by no means a surprise.\"Thatrsquos why I am calling for a feasibility study into extending the Borders Railway from Tweedbank to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.\"And I will continue to campaign for rail services toto Reston.\"This will improve connectivity across the Borders.\"More than four million journeys have been made on the Borders Railway since it opened in .The popularity of the -mile stretch of track is showing no signs of slowing down either with year on year increases.But there are regular complaints from passengers about standing-room only carriages for much of the journey.ScotRail announced last year that new Class  trains would be brought onto the Borders Railway -

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

It was wild, terrying, demented. A man in a gorilla suit was burned alive by a dwarf, Death walked the Earth, nobles partied within the walls of a castle as the plague raged outside. It blew my tiny mind and scared me witless, but I kept silent, hidden behind the sofa, as I knew it was taboo andmy parents realised I was there, theyrsquod send me to bed.On screen was an actor I would come to love ndash Vincent Price as the evil Prince Prospero. My parents only discovered I was there when the National Anthem started playing, and they turned on the lights and found me, goggle-eyed like some creepy imp in flannel pyjamas.Irsquove spent the rest of my le watching horror films ndash so as the witching season approaches, and the latest Halloween movie gets ready to open in cinemas, I thought Irsquod give you a guide to the secrets of the genre ndash and tell you what really makes a fright flick tick.THE WOODSIt doesnrsquot have to be the woods ndash though it often is ndash but location is as important to a horror movie as it is to Kirsty Allsopp and Phil Spencer. Think of Jonathan Harkerrsquos journey to Transylvania ndash a scene which opens countless Dracula films. The mountains, the inn, the forest, the wolves, the fog, the night ... the castle. A Dracula movie would be as naked without its classic location as the count without his cape.A great location doesnrsquot have to be some gothic throwback either. Look at An America Werewolf in London ndash it fetishises both the English countryside and the grungy grimy London of the early s ndash or the spaceship in Alien, which becomes a white, pared-back, claustrophobic hunting ground.The ballsiest horrors find the most unlikely location and just go for it ndash all great horror films take enormous risks with everything from script to casting and lightning to sound ndash so how about: a creepy ballet school for girls, soaked in vivid technicolour, in Dario Argentorsquos Suspiria a ski lt in Frozeninside a grave in Buried a railway carriage in Train to Busana punk rock venue in The Green Room, or a locked house in Donrsquot Breathe.None of these films would workthe director had chosen another setting ndash the setting is as important as the characters, the killings, and the creeps that the films wring from you.THE JUMPSHave you ever caught the Luton Bus  Or rather the Lewton Bus  If yoursquove watched the s movie Cat People by Val Lewton then yoursquoll know what I mean.In one scene we see our heroine being hunted by a killer we expect to turn into a panther at any moment. The tension builds and just when wersquore sure itrsquos all going to end in blood and fur, a bus screeches by making viewers leap from their seats. Therersquos no murder, no mayhem ndash but it is famously the scariest part of the film. If you donrsquot jump at least once in a horror movie, whatrsquos the point, most fans would say  We come to be scared.Bad directors use music to make you jump ndash a screeching violin is not a scare ndash or cliche, like Jason Voorhees ndash the killer in the Friday the th franchise ndash leaping up from the dead just when we think wersquore safe. Great film-makers like Lewton use your mind to make you jump, nothing .What a good jump scare depends on is sudden unexpected movement ndash tapping into that fear we have of something unexplained glimpsed from the corner of your eye. Look at the \"Sloth\" scene in Seen: the camera lingers over a shrivelled body which police have found tied to a bed. Suddenly, the \"corpse\" moves, struggling in its bonds. The entire set-up is overturned ndash a body we thought was dead, isnrsquot.The switch itself implies something ghastly: whatever is on the bed has been suffering for months in agony. In one split-second, David Fincher physically and emotional terrorises us.Perhaps, the greatest jump scare is in the much underrated The Exorcist III where a satanic killer is on the loose. One two-minute scene features a static long shot of a hospital hall. A nurse is making her rounds at night ndash her red cardigan the only colour on screen.Nothing  happens ndash but we know something has to happen, this is a horror movie. Just as the audience is lulled into a sense of calm, a shroud-draped man with a giant pair of medical shears ndash the kind used for amputations ndash charges at the nurse from behind.I remember audibly screaming in the cinema in  at this scene ... I loved it.THE MONSTERThere are three main types of baddie in horror films: the Monster, the Psycho, and the Thing. Letrsquos start with the monster.First of all, the Monster isnrsquot human and thatrsquos whatrsquos frightening. Whether itrsquos the shark in Jaws, whatever the hell is in the woods in The Blair Witch Project, the house in The Haunting of Hill House, giant ants in the s creature feature Them!, the xenomorph in Alien, or the demons from The Mist ndash these monsters are relentless. They will not stop ndash and we cannot fathom what drives them, beyond a desire to kill, yet they also possess a preternatural human-like intelligence.Monsters create unanswered questions ndash and ignorance means fear: Why is this shark out for revenge  What is running wild in the woods  Why wonrsquot the house stop shaking  Why are those ants the size of a Ford Focus  Why is that alien hugging my face  What are demons doing in a suburban supermarket The Monster works on the fear of the unknown, or the ugly ndash fear of the non-human. The Monster plays on those deep-seated fears we experience as children ndash the creature under the bed at night, or something beneath your feet when yoursquore swimming.THE PSYCHOThe Psycho, however, works on the opposite emotion ndash the fear of fellow humans, that behind our smiles and civilised cappuccinos lie salivating lunatics eager to kill.What better place to start with the Psycho, then, than with Hitchcockrsquos Norman Bates. The original Psycho was based on a real murderer ndash a necrophile, mother-killing, grave-robbing Wisconsin weirdo called Ed Gein .The roots of the Psycho always lie in reality ndash thatrsquos the fear factor. Could we one day meet such killers in real le  Might we already know a Hannibal Lecter, the urbane cannibal psychiatrist with a nose for good perfume and an eye for cheap shoes a Patrick Bateman, the boardroom American Psycho a Jack Torrance from The Shining ndash the intellectual family man about to snap and kill.THE THINGWhen it comes to the Thing, itrsquos all about the Uncanny Valley ndash the psychological theory that when something resembles a human being closely, but just not quite enough, it elicits a horrible feeling of dread.Think of Nosferatursquos spindly long-fingered decaying fiend, the creature in the attic in Rec, Frankensteinrsquos creation bolted together from scraps of corpses, any zombie, the demonic Cenobites from Hellraiser, the baby in Eraserhead, possessed Regan in The Exorcist, even Hal from : A Space Odyssey.These creatures almost look like us, or in Halrsquos case sound like us, but we know they are not us ndash and so they scare the daylights out of us.THE SALLYIt was once standard operating procedure in horror films that there would always be a survivor ndash usually a woman, known in the industry by the slightly sexist term \"The Last Girl\".I prefer to call this survivor character \"The Sally\" in homage to the female lead in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Sally Hardesty, played by s scream queen Marilyn Burns. Texas is loved and hated in equal measure. Horror fans hail it as the darkest and cleverest of the ultra-violent classic slasher films.PhDs have been written on Texas. Itrsquos even been interpreted as a comment on Watergate ndash the deranged hill billy cannibal serial killers do live in a big \"white house\" after all. People who donrsquot watch horror films, though, detest Texas as little more that snuff-inspired torture porn.Director Tobe Hooper put his Sally character through hell at the hands of Leatherface, grandpa and the rest of the slavering clan. When I first watched Texas during the s video nasty era, I felt physically broken afterwards ndash the violence, the terror, the bestial nature of what was happening on screen literally overwhelmed me.But Sally survived ndash and because Sally survived, good won the day. Horror films often rely on such simply fairy tale tricks ndash make me feel scared but then offer hope that what scared me will be defeated and the result is Pavlovian, punters come back for more.Sally led to Laurie Strode, the lead character in the original  Halloween. Now Laurie is dferent to Sally. Sally does a lot of running and screaming and crying ndash Laurie does a lot of running and hiding and trying to breath quietly in cupboards, but then something very important happens: Laurie turns on the killer, the villain Michael Myers.In fact, at one point, we think shersquos killed Myers, clad in his creepy William Shatner face mask . But, in a tradition that Halloween basically forged, the bogeyman lives to kill another day. Nevertheless, he was still vanquished, for the time being at least, by the female protagonist who remains standing.Sometimes, though, The Sally doesnrsquot survive ndash a development seen increasingly in films with a strong artistic bent. In the nihilistic masterpiece Funny Games, Michael Hanekersquos Pinteresque descent into hell, the end is one of deliberate despair ndash no-one will live, and the killers are coming for you next.THE SEXESUnsurprisingly, given that horror exploits our real fears, most villains are men. Horror movies draw very heavily on a primordial battle of the sexes theme: the brutal killer, often a mere personication of evil, versus the sparky, clever woman pushed to the limits of endurance.However, not all horror films conform to the genre. Some switch, and the female villain is far from unknown ndash but when you analyse why the woman is a killer, itrsquos for very dferent reasons to the men.Women donrsquot pick up chainsaws and go on mindless murder sprees ndash women killers tend to act out psychologically, and that can can often create the greatest of screen villains. For proof, enter Annie Wilkes from Misery, an obsessive fan with a fine line in moral rectitudeand a taste for torture.In recent decades, more women began to pop up who should have been put in a straitjacket from birth. Therersquos Lola Stone in The Loved Ones ndash a girl you donrsquot want to invite to a house party Tina, a murderous National Trust nerd, in Ben Wheatleyrsquos black comedy of modern manners Sightseers and Marie, the worst best friend a girl ever asked for in the French new wave horror Switchblade Romance.Carrie is probably the most nuanced female character in any horror film ndash she is both villain and victim. Abused by a religious maniac mother, bullied and sexually humiliated by her classmates, Sissy Spacek as Carrie becomes the revenge prototype of teen female anger.Increasingly, wersquore beginning to see men enter the role of the victim. Take the Belgian movie The Ordeal. Instead of a woman held captive by a male predator, it is a man who is imprisoned and tormented: a good way to bring home to the audience that often the gaze in horror films is on female suffering.THE MEANINGA great horror film has to say something ndash an awful horror film just drips blood all over the cinema seat and leaves you as unsatisfied as a ten pound box of popcorn. By \"saying something\", I donrsquot mean art house pretension ndash I mean that a horror movie must resonate with its times.Horror is the most mutable of genres, apart from comedy. People have fallen in love for the same reasons since time immemorial, people have sought revenge for the same reasons since time immemorial, but jokes change from one day to the next. Horror also changes, not because what scares us changesbut because for horror to work it must relate to you and the fears of the time in which you live.Yoursquoll not be scared by Little Red Riding Hood, but centuries ago it terried your ancestors. Whats needed to scare modern viewers is something that echoes in our real lives ndash think of all those s B movies rfing off the unseen menace of reds under the bed like Invasion of the Body Snatchers or Cronenbergrsquos body-horror movies, like The Fly, driven by the fear of technology there was even a spate of post-s hippie horrors in the wake of the Manson family killings like Last House on the Left.Probably the two best examples of horror movies tapping into modern fears come in the shape of Eden Lake, and Ils . Eden Lake uses fear of the dispossessed to get its hooks into viewers. It makes the viewer wonderthe poor, the uneducated, the forgotten will one day rise up and kill them.This is the horror of the housing estate. It is a brutal take on what happens when the suburban middle classes rub up against the \"underclass\".Ils ndash Them ndash is similar in tone but here it is children who are the terror. It prods at the hidden adult fear that children could quite easily killthey wished. Wersquove seen terrible crimes committed by bored, abused, forgotten children unfold in our papers and on the TV news ndash this film seems to say,you beat a dog long enough it will bite you back, no matter how weak it is.Irsquom not trying to convince anyone that horror is art ndash though as a fan of horror movies, I do think the genre is capable of high art when at its very best.In a strange way, what horror can do is make you feel alive because it makes you confront death. Thatrsquos probably what I realised in my four-year-old mind back in the early s when Vincent Price scared the pants off me in The Masque of the Red Death.As the old toast goes from The Bride of Frankenstein: \"To a new world of Gods and Monsters!\""},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-mops-up-after-storm-callum","story":"Scotland is mopping up after Storm Callum, which brought heavy rain and flooding to swathes of the country.A Met Office yellow \"be aware\" alert for the south west of the country, the Lothians, Borders and Strathclyde areas was lted at midnight.

Lower level flood alerts were also in place for Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders.Sepas duty flooding manager David Faichney said yesterday the band of rain following Storm Callum would bring downpours of more than mm.He said: ldquoRivers are likely to risehellipI think there will be a lot of surface water. At this time of year, with leaves coming off the trees, drains tend to get blocked up... Flooding of roads, that will happen locally.\"Traffic Scotland urged motorists to drive with caution yesterday due to surface water on the roads. Flooding was reporting on section of the M.One motorist told the Herald on Sunday he saw a car lose control on the M near Glasgow, and hit the central reservation.ldquoI was travelling south from Forfar, said Alan Morrison. ldquoThe A was treacherous, with visibility poor and many drivers did not have their lights on. I saw a white BMW hit the central reservation on the M, about a mile from the junction with the M. There was a lot of standing water on the roads, with pools of water gathering in some places.On the transport network, some rail services were hit by delays, with the weather affecting the route between Preston and Scotland.Strong winds also saw speed restrictions imposed on many routes - with reduced Virgin services between London Euston, Birmingham New Street, and Edinburgh and Glasgow, Network Rail said.One of the worst affected areas in the UK was the village of Aberdulais in Neath Port Talbot where residents were ordered to evacuate their homes due to rising river levels amid reports of the worst floods there for  years.Meanwhile in the town of Crickhowell in the Brecon Beacons national park, where the River Usk burst its banks, some properties were also flooded, with up to ft of water.High winds brought by Storm Callum delayed the start of fracking at a site in Lancashire.Work was expected to get under way at Preston New Road, Little Plumpton, near Blackpool on Saturday after an environmental campaigner failed in a High Court bid to block operations.But energy firm Cuadrilla said fracking had been postponed until Monday as the region felt the effects of Storm Callum.Meanwhile, fresh landslips on Friday caused by Storm Callum as it swept the west of Scotland will keep the Rest and be Thankful closed over the weekend.Heavy rain and strong winds brought  tonnes of debris from the hillside on to the A in Argyll and Bute on Friday as operators tried to clear landslips from earlier in the week.The closure has caused a ersion for motorists. Bear Scotland said work is continuing to repair the debris fencing, clear the carriageway and reinstate drainage.North west manager Eddie Ross said: ldquoStorm Callum is continuing to bring more heavy rain to the area, limiting visibility and making conditions dficult for the teams to progress repairs and the clear-up of yesterdays additional landslides.ldquoDespite this, teams are working exceptionally hard to do all they can to make the area safe, however until then the road and the Old Military Road local ersion has to remain closed for safety reasons.ldquoWere aware of the impact this is having on the busy weekend and holiday traffic and were doing all we can to help ensure the ersion route via the A at Dalmally keeps moving by having further safety patrols on the route to help any motorists as required."},{"url":null,"title":"future-shock-we-owe-david-icke-and-elon-musk-an-apology-if-quantum-experiment-proves-we-are-living-in-the-matrix","story":"ldquoThe universe is an illusion, the goalkeeper-turned-Messiah told an unconvinced Terry Wogan during a now legendary TV interview in . Icke ndash who preferred to be called ldquoSon of the Godhead at the time ndash had failed to ingratiate himself to the bemused host, perhaps regretfully kicking off the chat by informing Wogan that the moon was a hollow alien spaceship.Personal eccentricities aside,it turns out Icke was correct about whatrsquos now dubbed the ldquoSimulation Argument, we all owe him an apology. The turquoise shellsuit and mullet remain utterly unforgivable, of course.Although this increasingly popular theory was first mooted by Greek philosopher Plato in BC then sweetened for popular consumption by The Matrix, itrsquos Oxford academic Nick Bostromrsquos recent paper supporting the concept that has lent it some heavyweight credibility.Respected US astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson gives it ldquobetter than - odds that the simulation hypothesis is correct. ldquoI wish I could summon a strong argument against it, but I can find none, is his unsettling conclusion. Impish billionaire futurist Elon Musk has also mused ndash to a chorus of groans from Tesla shareholders ndash that wersquore ldquomost likely in a simulation. It must be noted, however, that Musk was recently filmed smoking a rather large cannabis joint.If the Simulation Argument is indeed accurate, it means everything we understand as empirical, objective reality ndash the entire universe ndash may actually have only sprung into existence a millisecond ago. Like someone firing up their Xbox for a shot of Assassinrsquos Creed. Our memories saved data, surroundings a hologram and bodies simply avatars, programmed to perceive a notion of forward-movement we call ldquotime. This serves to anchor our ldquothoughts and allows us a concept of ldquofuture for an illusionary sense of ldquoself.But breathe, itrsquos not all bad news ndash the theory allows for one possibility that accepts yoursquore actually real. In fact, it suggests you are actually all that exists within this particular articial reality and that everything in the universe is simply the creation of your mind.This rather egotistical belief system is known as solipsism and sceptics who are  percent convinced of their own existence should note there are no definitive philosophical rebuttals to the theory. Itrsquos certainly a tragedy I canrsquot convince you of my own existence, even when my picture appears right next to these words. If you are indeed the one who is dreaming all this up, please note Irsquod appreciate a less ridiculous hairdo.Soit turns out the entire universe is just an infinitely isible virtual reality where molecules are pixels, itrsquos likely our lives are simply some computer game played by alien children. And I suspect those who controlled the avatars of Leonardo da Vinci, Shakespeare and Prince used cheat codes.Compute the mind of GodIF any of these unsettling musings truly reflect reality, then this simulationrsquos coding for irony is certainly in need of a debug this week.Researchers from the University of Basque in Spain are currently embarking upon a new venture to reveal the true nature of the universe ndash using, yes, a computer. They do say it takes a thief to catch a thief.Itrsquos actually doubly ironic that it is shiny new ldquoquantum computers that are being used to ldquorecreate the origin of Darwinian evolution.This is because events in quantum physics have a truly inexplicable and weird way of being influenced by observation ndash like a tree in the woods only falling when someone can see it. Some scientists believe such oddness at the molecular level of reality may be an actual quirkinside our simulation.These Spanish researchers, however, are clearly aware of the potential irony of asking a computer to essentially explain and understand itself. ldquoWe leave open the question whether the origin of le is genuinely quantum mechanical, confirmed one of the scientists involved, rather cryptically.Perhaps itrsquos no coincidence New Yorker magazine recently reported two unnamed tech billionaires have employed a number of scientists to work out how to break them out of the simulation using quantum computers.QUANTUM OF SOLACESo whatrsquos so special about these quantum computers compared to that shiny new Macbook you only use for surfing the net and assimilating into societys higher social tiers  Well, the truth is even those who construct quantum computers dont really understand the dference. But they believe the chasm is seismic.Todayrsquos mass market machines compute using an internal binary language of s and s, while quantum machines also have a third potential state that lies, well hellip somewhere in between. Because of this, their computational units ndash known as quibits ndash have the special ability to become \"entangled\" with other quibits. After entering such a relationship, quibits will then instantly reflect any changes in its lsquotwinrsquo.Why does this weird lsquomirroring matter  Well, many particle physicists believe itrsquos an action that actually takes place outside of what we perceive as spacetime. This is because distance seems to be no barrier to quibitsrsquo instant communication. And now, were slowly learning how to harness this ability in order to create machines of almost infinite computing power. Simply, your Macs s and s are very slow and the timeless dimension in-between is not. Forget that thing Richard Pryor created in Superman , wersquore talking machines as powerful as the Transformersrsquo home planet of Cybertron.LOOKING FOR LUCAIT may be the case that quantum machines donrsquot discover a simulation at the root of reality, but actually confirm that Darwinian evolution all boils down to the mysterious ancient leform known as LUCA .What makes this great granny of all things especially fascinating is that it had the chance of eternal le ndash but decided to die so we could live. Just like Jesus four billion years later.Most evolutionary biologists are convinced that everything that has ever existed originates from LUCA, and a genetic portrait was recently created by evolutionary biologists at the Heinrich Heine University in Duumlsseldorf. Apparently this oddity existed in deep sea vents on the magma-drenched, celestial baby Earth and was unlike anything  that has ever existed ndash a spindling conglomeration of tiny cells that spent hundreds of millions of years simply chilling in the sea doing nothing. Blind, deaf yet perhaps not so dumb.Itrsquos notable that gender or death did not exist on Earth until LUCA unzipped itself to kick off evolution, shuffling around its genetics using some mysterious early form of osmosis.Why this organism died to unleash its essential ingredients and create all le on this planet remains a deep, abiding mystery. Or perhaps LUCA was simply an alien virus in our simulation, programmed to self-destruct and seed this virtual Earth with avatars. If so, the creators of this particular illusion are playing a very long game indeed.AND FINALLY hellipEXPANDING further upon Oxford philosopher Nick Bostromrsquos recent Simulation Theory paper, whatrsquos particularly striking is its casual assumption of many long-lived alien civilisations existing out there.If these beings run computer simulations ndash and they will, says Bostrom ndash then articial realities must be abundant throughout the universe. The problem is, these alien programmers would ndash like us ndash have no idea whether theyrsquore part of a simulation themselves. Every universe may simply be a Russian doll trapped within the darkness of another ndash an artical multiverse.Yet,we are indeed living in the root level of reality, perhaps our universal common ancestor LUCA was still a computer virus of sorts ndash one that sacriced its original form to set evolution in motion, hoping to gain a multi-dimentional perspective of reality through the eyes of everything that has ever lived and died on Earth.From the birds in the sky to fungus in the fields, LUCA is likely hiding in plain sight, with infinite perceptions of reality at its disposal to understand and conquer its planet completely.And when its greatest achievement ndash humans ndash finally blast off to the stars, the entire universe awaits."},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-new-blackadder-series-dashed","story":"The show starring Rowan Atkinson as the anti-hero Edmund Blackadder and Sir Tony Robinson as his hapless servant Baldrick was cult viewing in the s.Also featuring were Hugh Laurie, Tim McInnerny, Stephen Fry and the late Rik Mayall with Ben Elton co-writing many of the episodes.The four series were each set in a dferent period of English history, covering the Middle Ages, Elizabethan England, the Georgian era and the First World War.Over the years there have been many people who wanted to see another series made with Blackadder set in modern times.Only last month, Sir Tony said he thought a fth series could be made, despite the original cast having very busy schedules.And last year Atkinson spoke of how  years ago there was an idea for a series set during the Russian Revolution, called Redadder, but plans went ldquonowhere.But Curtis, who went on to write blockbuster films Four Weddings And A Funeral, Love Actually, Notting Hill and Bridget Jonesrsquos Diary, scotched chances of a Blackadder revival.ldquoBlackadder is a very, very complicated group of people and soyou are fond enough of the series to wish that the people involved in it should live to a ripe old age then I think it is best that we donrsquot work together, thatrsquos the answer, Curtis said.The screenwriter was speaking during an event at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, in which he was interviewed by his daughter Scarlett, who revealed her mother, Emma Freud, has never watched an episode of Blackadder.Curtis explained how he and Atkinson, who himself has gone on to have global success with Mr Bean and Johnny English, dreamt up Blackadder.ldquoBlackadder was in a funny way written out of fear, Curtis said.ldquoSomeone called John Cleese had written a show called Fawlty Towers and when Rowan and I tried to write a modern situation comedy we just knew it was rubbish in comparison to that.ldquoSo we decided to write about history and it really came from two sources, one of which was a series of books called the Ladybird Book of History and the other was the plays of Shakespeare because they were also stupid and people also wore stupid costumes.Curtis added: ldquoI am sorry about the bad episodes they were all written by a guy called Ben Elton.He also gave some tips about his techniques for writing, saying that many wannabe writers give up too early.ldquoThe dference between me and a writer who doesnrsquot go on writing is that I write % good a day and I think that has been a fantastic day and many people give up writing because they write for a day and they have got % of rubbish, he said.ldquoI did once work out I had written , pages to reach Notting Hill which was a -page script.ldquoI think keeping faith and noticing whatrsquos good and I think the edits of movies are unbelievably rigorous and necessary and a few of my films have been not what I dreamed but they were finished.ldquoThe most interesting was Bridget which didnrsquot work at all until we moved the penultimate scene, which was her in absolute despair in her bedroom dressed in red pyjamas drinking and crying, to the title sequence of the movie, which meant you actually felt for Bridget right from the start, which in our original cut you just didnrsquot.ldquoThere are miraculous things that can happen in the edit.ldquoLove Actually is a bad example because it didnrsquot work at all when we finished it and the one where the finished product was at least like the script I wrote and in fact we had to delay the moviersquos release by three months to just start again."},{"url":null,"title":"hunt-goes-on-for-man-who-subjected-young-student-to-terrifying-ordeal","story":"This summer, on a Glasgow path overgrown by trees, a man first circled a woman and tried to lure her into some woods. Then he exposed himself and began masturbating.His victim, deeply distressed, escaped. So ndash at least for now ndash has he.That is because, weeks after his crime, the man remains at large. Police Scotland say they have ldquono positive line of inquiry, their way of saying they are not pursuing any specic leads. Their investigation, carried out by specialist public protection detectives, ldquoremains open.Officers do not doubt, insiders stress, the credibility and good faith of the victim and their only witness, a then -year-old student. She, however, does doubt them. So much so that in last weekrsquos Herald on Sunday the woman, Caitie Mackay, waived her anonymity to express her hurt and frustration about both the crime and the way she felt it was handled by the police. Her story was powerfully told by her father, The Herald and Herald on Sunday writer-at-large Neil Mackay. Very few victims of sexual offences are able to share their perspective. Fewer still have the courage to do so under their own name.Caitie said she had identied a suspect to the police but that this man had never been interviewed. Why  Because, she was told, he would be unfit to understand the process. Last week, we suggested the man had mental health issues. In fact, we can now report, he has serious learning dficulties.She said the man was stalking her, turning up at her work, one of Glasgowrsquos biggest shopping malls. She did not feel safe. ldquoTrying to get any form of justice or protection is pointless, Caitie said. ldquoI feel aswhat happened to me simply does not matter. My faith in the police is destroyed.Last week, Mackay, profoundly worried about his daughter ndash and about the public interest issues he raised about the investigation of sex crimes ndash put a series of questions to the police. This week we can report how they responded.Officers spoken to by The Herald have great sympathy and respect for Mackay and his daughter. Their perspective on the investigation, is, however, in some details, is at odds with that of the Mackay family.So much so that some of their dferences may have to be resolved by a complaints process already under way thanks to formal interest from a politician following our story last week.Police, specically, say they carried out an extensive investigation in to Caitiersquos complaint ndash which is one of public indecency rather than ldquoa sexual assault, as we termed the offence in a headline last week.They also say there is ldquoinsufficient evidence to link the man with learning dficulties to the case.And they say they have no record of any report of stalking against the man. The Mackays dispute this and are understood to be considering their own formal complaint against the police.The officer in charge of investigating this case is Detective Superintendent Alwyn Bell. He leads Glasgow isionrsquos team of public protection detectives, specialists in sex crimes. It was his unit, he explained, which took over the case shortly after Caitie reported it.Bell said: ldquoFollowing a report of a man having indecently exposed himself near to Darnley train station on July , officers spoke to the victim and carried out a number of inquiries including a full search of the area.ldquoThe inquiry was then allocated to the dedicated Public Protection Unit within the ision, and following a CCTV check and other inquiries, there was no further information available at that time to identy a suspect. However, the inquiry remained open.Bell said that efforts had been made to keep the victim updated on this investigation by phone but added that ldquoofficers were unsuccessful. The detective, who has occupied senior public protection roles in both Glasgow and Edinburgh, also addressed ndash within serious legal limitations on what he can say ndash the concerns the Mackays had over the man identied by Caitie as her attacker.He said: ldquoOn July , the victim made a further call to police reporting that she had seen the suspect within her workplace. Officers attended to speak to her and the suspect was identied by the victim as being the inidual who had carried out the public indecency. ldquoInquiries were undertaken and, due to his behaviour, he was ed home to his parents. Officers then obtained medical advice regarding the suspectrsquos condition and it was made clear by a medical professional that he has signicant learning dficulties, and therefore lacks the capacity to understand a police interview or the ramications of his actions or conduct.The man is on Police Scotlandrsquos vulnerable persons database or VPD. He has been the subject of some inquiries. However, the force, in a formal statement to The Herald on Sunday, said they currently do not have a positive line of inquiry in the case.Bell added: ldquoThe inquiry into this incident remains open and we would ask anyone who has any information which may assist, to contact us.The story centres on some of the trickiest and most sensitive areas of police work: updating victims on live investigations and handling inquiries which touch on vulnerable people.There can be legal, ethical and practical reasons why officers cannot share the full story of any live inquiry to complex, messy, human crimes with journalists, the relatives of adult victims and victims themselves. There can also be miscommunications and misunderstandings between police and those whose lives are affected by crime and its investigation.The circumstances of this case now look likely to be settled by a formal independent process of complaints.Police Scotland has faced complaints about such issues before, including those which have been upheld and those which have not been. Each such complaint, say insiders, offers a chance to learn lessons or get to the bottom of a dispute.The force in recent years has also increasingly secured the trust of organisations which support victims of sex crimes. Whatever the outcome of formal concerns about the Mackay case, the force will be eager to rebuild trust among victims and their families. Dfering perspectives on the course of the investigation aside, insiders stress they see Caitie as a good faith witness.Senior officers in recent years have put huge public emphasis on a message that they want to hear reports of sexual offences. Last financial year they recorded nearly , such crimes, more than double the historic norm. Numbers continue to rise this year, early reports suggest. In -, there were  cases of public indecency, the kind of offence experienced by Caitie.Somebody, police are sure, put Caitie through a terrying ordeal on July . That somebody has not been caught. There have not been any reports of similar crimes in the area. However, the man who tormented Caitie may well have exposed himself to others. If you were one of those women, or have any information about who the man might be, contact Police Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-to-unveil-common-sense-brexit-plans","story":"The publication, due out on Monday, will reinforce the case for continued membership of the single market and customs union, Scotlands First Minister said.It will also argue that the UK Governments \" choice\" between a \"bad, possibly blindfold\" Brexit deal and a no-deal scenario should not be accepted.The release of the paper will come as the First Minister gives a speech at the Royal Society of Artsin London on Monday.Speaking in advance of the address, Ms Sturgeon said: \"The UK is scheduled to leave the European Union less than six months from now -

In the first instance, we would have to offer the land to other parts of government to use it for other purposes.ldquoBarlinnie is a Victorian prison and in need of replacement.ldquoWersquove enjoyed unprecedented levels of investment in our prison estate in the last decade, which has seen us tackle a number of major priorities.ldquoBarlinnie remains one. Its replacement is in the government infrastructure plan. Wersquove been active in looking at a number of potential sites to relocate the prison.Executions were once announced with a notice on the prisons doorSuch a switch would be a surreal twist in the history of Barlinnie, known to Glaswegians as the Big Hoose or the Bar-L.Opened in , it was envisaged as an enlightened effort to reform the brutal penal policy Victorians were familiar with.Many were put to work - with baking, basket-weaving, carpentry, shoemaking all jobs done by prisoners, as was breaking the sandstone at a nearby quarry for the further halls which would take the prison up to capacity.:Nurse at Barlinnie warns of lots of drugs errors and dangerous night-staff ratio#Now cracked and blackened with age, the stone walls of Barlinnie grew to house a notional , souls but would see the population swell to almost twice that as time went by.Stories abound about the dangerous overcrowding within, with prisoners crammed on top of each other in cells two metres wide by three and a half long designed for single occupancy.Today is is home to around , prisoners, and conditions have approved.

While designed to rehabilitate wrongdoers, in  it became the last home some of its inhabitants would ever see when it became a place of execution.Between then and , when the publics attitude to capital punishment hardened, ten men were put to death in Barlinnies hanging shed, their bodied taken from the noose and placed on a mortuary slab in a chamber below.:The art that changed the men in Barlinnie#The last man to die in the hangmans noose was barely a man at all.

In doing so, he discovers new insights into how decisions were made about land far from Edinburgh and London.HIGHER LEARNINGMore than  years ago, the last Conservative Secretary of State to rule Scotland before devolution made one of the most important announcements about the future of the Highlands and Islands. The region, Michael Forsyth, said would get its own university. No longer would all students have to go south to learn after school.Mr Forsyth was speaking at a  meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee of MPs in Inverness. But he was not,- Mr Ross has discovered, saying things that Scotlandrsquos senior civil servants and all its established universities wanted to hear.Mr Ross wrote: ldquoI received a phone call from a Scottish Office civil servant after the meeting askingI had notes of what exactly Mr Forsyth had said onthe subject, as he and his colleagueshad no detail.ldquoWe later learnt Mr Forsyth had asked an opposition MP to ask a question about the university.For his book, Mr Ross went back to Mr Forsyth, now Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. ldquoOn the University of the Highlands and Islands, I just couldnrsquot get anywhere. The universities were all lobbying against it, the officials were against it. I could just see the whole thing disappearing into a three-year review. I thought we will just announce we are doing it, then they will have to get on with it. So thatrsquos what I did.David Ross on his Herald beatNow the institution has  colleges, with more than  local learning centres and thousands of students. The old Scottish Office as recently as  had described a campaign for a Highland university as ldquopremature and prejudicial.BRAVEHEART, CULLODEN AND THE TORIESHe was the Scottish secretary who ed the Stone of Destiny to Edinburgh. But, Mr Ross reveals, Lord Forsyth had another huge fight with civil servants over how to remember the last great battle on British soil and one of events which defined the Highlands of today: Culloden.In Highland Herald, Mr Ross describes how the then Mr Forsyth wanted to commemorate the battlersquos th anniversary in  as part of a civil war. But, the politician told Mr Ross, officials were ldquodesperate to keep it as low key as possible, because they thought it was sensitive.Lord Forsyth added: ldquoAnd I had to cope with the film Braveheart as well. It became apparent that people confused the Wars of Scottish Independence in the th Century with Culloden in the th Century, and had no understanding as to what this was all about.Mel GibsonThis was the era of high polling for Scottish independence and even higher support for a new parliament in Edinburgh, a body that was to materialise three years later.THE LAND QUESTIONConservatives may have been seen as the party of the lairds but Lord Forsyth told Mr Ross a dferent story. ldquoWe have had some horrendous examples of horrible landlords, he said, ldquomainly from outside Scotland.Community buy-outs became one of the biggest stories Mr Ross told about the Highlands over  years. In his book, he hears from a senior official that development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprisehad been initially dubious about supporting the Assynt Croftersrsquo historic and ultimately successful campaign to win their land  years ago.Andrew Thin, who was Chief Executive of Caithness and Sutherland Enterprise and today is Chairman of the Scottish Land Commission, recalls the early HIE approach was: ldquoQuiet moral support behind the scenes perhaps, but not a suitable use of public funds.However, an article in The Daily , he had been told, heralded an instruction from a high level in Whitehall that Assynt was exactly the sort of demonstration of local initiative and enterprise that should be supported. HIErsquos attitude changed thereafter and the agency in the end contributed pound,, as well as giving the Assynt Crofters advice and encouragement.Other communities, such as Eigg, Knoydart, Gigha followed. Now well over , acres are under community ownershipTHE CLEARANCES CONTROVERSIESThe Assynt crofters drive to take back their land reflected generations of hurt over who owns Scotland - and the Clearances of the poor, often Gaelic-speaking, from the Highlands in the centuries after Culloden.This year the historian Sir Tom Devine has revisited the issue and claried that the Clearances were far from just a Highland issue, taking issue with the traditional take of popular historian John Prebble, who Mr Ross knew.John PrebbleIn Highland Herald, Mr Ross looks at the legacy of Mr Prebble, whose work was once dismissed by a late historiographer royal as ldquoutter rubbish.Mr Ross said: ldquoWhether or not the Highlands and Islands suffered worse depopulation numerically compared to other parts of Scotland, I have never felt was the most important issue. Rather it was the impact on the people, which Sorley MacLean described as the ldquophenomenon of phenomena.Mr MacLean was Mr Rossrsquos father-in-law and his book includes praise to the late bard which Mr Ross says he would have found ldquoexcruciating.TONGUE LASHINGMr Ross back in  came in for a not always gentle Fleet Street ribbing when he was covering the manhunt for a -year-old girl and her -year-old boyfriend. He spotted the pair near Tongue but called the police rather than try to get a scoop and speak to them.In his book, the reporter explains that ethical rules of his trade meant he could not interview a child without a responsible adult present.

Sands helpline operates from .am to .pm Monday to Friday and pm to pm Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Sands is leading a coalition of more than  charities working to prevent baby deaths and pregnancy loss. Jointly, they are urging all NHS Trusts and Boards to improve bereavement care for parents across the UK.The call comes during Baby Loss Awareness Week, which runs from October  to October .The week also marks the roll-out of the National Bereavement Care Pathway , a partnership between the charities, governments and the NHS.The pathway sets out standards for providing excellent care to anyone affected by pregnancy and baby loss.This year is also Sands’ th anniversary, providing support to parents who have suffered a bereavement.While there have been many improvements since , unfortunately, inconsistencies still remain across the UK.Marc Harder, the NBCP project lead for Sands, said: “Standards of care across the country right now are very much inconsistent.“We want those in power to ensure that bereaved parents get the best possible care, wherever they live and wherever they present themselves – whether that be AE, a maternity unit or early pregnancy unit.“Sadly, health care professionals don’t always have the training they need to speak to bereaved parents.“In an audit we carried out last year, only  per cent of Trusts with maternity units provided mandatory bereavement training.“And of those  per cent,  per cent of them only provided their staff with one hour or less of bereavement training each year.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Local politicians have responded to Kirkcaldy Foodbanks urgent plea for help.

Marc added: “In the next  months, we have the opportunity to really make a dference in Scotland.“We have come a long, long way since  but we’ve still got a way to go.“We long for a world in which there is no baby loss. “Until then we’ll continue to work to ensure parents receive the best possible care they can during their bereavement journey.”Scottish Government funding lays pathway to improvementsIn April this year, the National Bereavement Care Pathwayfor pregnancy and baby loss was extended to Scotland, thanks to £, in funding from the Scottish Government. Sands is working with the Scottish Government, a number of baby loss charities and other health care partners in Scotland to develop the approach over the next two years, with the plan to pilot, implement and embed the NBCP across Scotland by March .Five experiences of pregnancy or baby loss are included in the NBCP including miscarriage, termination of pregnancy for foetal anomaly, stillbirth, neonatal death and the sudden unexpected death of an infant up to the age of  months.Health Secretary Shona Robison said: “The funding will allow implementation of the National Bereavement Care Pathway in pilot sites across Scotland and ensure all bereaved parents are offered high quality, sensitive bereavement care.”The development of the NBCP in Scotland is being overseen by a Scottish steering group.Kate Mulley, director of research, education and policy at Sands, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support of the Scottish Government and Sands support groups in Scotland who have contributed to the funding of this vital project which will make such a dference to so many families.” Forty years ago, two bereaved mothers, Bel Mooney and Hazelanne Lewis, found there was no support available. So they founded Sands in .At that time, most parents were not allowed to see, hold or bury their babies and they could not put their babies’ names on the stillbirth certicate.Sands is now the leading stillbirth and neonatal death charity in the UK. It works to reduce baby deaths through promoting better maternity care and funding research. The charity offers training and comprehensive bereavement support, both nationally through its helpline –    or via email at helpline@sands.org.uk – and locally via some  regional support groups.Further information can be found at www.sands.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"ne charity marks 30 years","story":"A charity which supports adults with learning disabilities and additional support needs in Inverurie has kicked off a year of celebrations to mark its th anniversary.Aberdeen-headquartered Inspire started le as Partnership Housing in  then became Partnership before adopting its current name in .Service provision began in  when three people moved from Aberdeen’s Woodlands Hospital into their new home in the city’s Fonthill Terrace.Now more than  adults are supported thanks to a range of initiatives in Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, Moray and Angus.Locally, the charity supports  people at St James’s Court and operates Inspire Soaps, a day service where iniduals have the opportunity to make soaps, candles, arts and crafts.To mark the start of its th birthday celebrations, Inspire recently held a special birthday party for corporate supporters, long serving staff and local authority representatives in Inverurie.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

Customer research by Scottish Water revealed tap is the water of choice for almost two thirds of people in Scotland , and currently over a thirdcarry reusable bottles always or often when out and about. But less than a thirdsaid theyd be happy to go into a cafeacute and ask for their bottle to be filled.On average a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save pound. a day, nearly pound a year.The Top Up Taps are made from marine-grade steel and are connected to the mains water supply.* For further information visit www.yourwateryourleMonday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amKirkwall leboat was launched shortly after am this morning to go to the aid of the yacht Narwhal which had lost power while on passage east of Orkney.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision. Hopefully this may enable greater resilience to be built into the service going forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online. In every case of a branch closing we are committed to providing the best possible range of alternatives.\"Monday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Stem cell research hit the headlines earlier this week after Glaswegian comedian Sir Billy Connolly revealed he would participate in a pioneering Hard University study which aims to use stem cells to find a cure for Parkinson’s. Censo said it has a “rapidly expanding” portfolio of major drug company clients choosing to outsource this specialised research, including some of the best known pharmaceutical and biotech companies across Europe, the US and Japan.The research firm plans to use the £.m investment to accelerate business growth, expand its marketing and sales capabilities, and broaden the range of commercial research services it provides to clients.The funding will be provided by three sources: Edinburgh-based venture capital firm Par Equity’s Par Syndicate EIS Fund, which invests in young, innovative technology companies the Par Syndicate, which is a network of specially selected expert investors and the Scottish Investment Bank. Aidan Courtney, chief executive at Censo, said: “This investment from Par Equity has come at exactly the right time for the company. “Over the past two years we have developed a comprehensive suite of resources which allow us to create human stem cells from any inidual and use derivatives of these cells to test drugs for clients. “Our focus on selected research areas, such as neuro-inflammation, has aligned extremely well with our clients’ needs and we are seeing more demand than we can accommodate with our current resources. “Par Equity’s investment will allow us to broaden our service offering and accelerate growth.”Paul Munn, partner at Par Equity, said: “Our investment gives Censo the capital to build upon its important work, but we’re also very active managers. “We’ll work closely with Censo’s management, drawing on the expertise and experience of our network of investors to give them the support they need to scale up this exciting business, which could help transform treatment of a number of serious diseases.”Censo was founded in  following the merger of Roslin Cellab and Roslin Cell Sciences, and has employs teamsin the Scottish capital and Cambridge.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4814514.1539583384!/image/image.jpg","title":"christine jardine we need to talk more about grief of losing a baby","story":"It#s probably quite unusual for a politician to use their column to write about a television programme, and one that had nothing whatsoever to do with politics.But this was so much more than a television programme. This was public broadcasting which really did serve a purpose.For the first time in longer than I care to remember, I was desperate to watch something at the first available opportunity that wasn’t about baking, or a comedy or a political show.BBC Alba’s Labour of Love’opened a window on a subject that for too long society has shied away from talking about. And, by hiding away, we denied generations of parents the support and recognition of their grief that they need when they lose their baby.So while at first glance some people might question whether this is an appropriate subject for a politician to comment on, surely this is where we have a responsibility to nurture an understanding and compassion not just in inidual cases, but in society.Last week was Baby Loss Awareness Week. At both Westminster and Holyrood, politicians recognised and debated the topic, with a genuine desire to offer support and empathy and, where possible, foster change.Many of those at the parliamentary events had personal experiences that they shared.Although I have been close to family and friends whose baby has died I still can’t imagine how painful it must have been for them. Or the strength it took for the parents in the programme to relive the trauma they had been through.: Dr Sureshini Sanders: We need to talk about death and griefAnd they did it with a purpose which was completely altruistic. After watching Labour of Love’ I called one of the mothers who had taken part. Annie Lundon is an old friend.I was her tutor at university, my late husband worked with her and we knew what she and her family were going through at the time.But watching the programme – partly because I knew she would be in it – brought home to me, and possibly many others watching, really for the first time, how little I had appreciated what she had been through when she lost Grace.In the programme, she talked about being told, some years after, that she had been suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome and how that felt “like a weight being lted from me when someone said that what you’ve been through is a terrible thing”.That made me realise how much more we as a society have to do to help. How much we haven’t yet done.We still need a taking of responsibility and recognition by care services of the support that’s needed.And an understanding that every inidual may need something dferent and for more than just the immediate aftermath.More importantly, Annie told me that talking about it had not only helped all of those who took part, and brought them together, but that it had helped so many others.Quite a lot of older women had, she told me, been in touch since the programme to say how pleased they were that it had been made.I’m glad they had the courage and foresight to do it too.: Richard Meade: Time to get over our hang-ups about death and bereavementBy sharing their personal experiences with us, they have created a public awareness and desire for action. And it is up to those of us in elected positions to ensure that action is carried out.During my career as a journalist, I remember so many issues like this one where an initial opening up led to a change in attitude.It’s not so long ago that we did not talk about mental health issues. We have made progress there, although we have a long way to go yet. Sexuality too was a taboo that is now openly acknowledged and respected.And while it might seem strange to reference them in the same space as the loss of a child, those issues are also personal, traumatic and something we shied away from talking about both as a society and iniduals.One of the things that has struck me throughout this week has been that it is those who have not faced the trauma of losing a child who are less willing to talk about it.We don’t quite know how to broach the subject and yet, as my friend told me, it made such a dference to her when they did.So what now  The danger is that, with Baby Loss Awareness Week behind us, we now move on.We don’t think about it until this time next year. We should not forget that we do not have that luxury.For those it has affected, it will always be there. So please, let’s take that on board. Let’s recognise that there are people in all of our lives who have been through a trauma we cannot appreciate and do what we can to lessen the trauma for those who, heartbreakingly, will have to face it in future.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4808184.1539583429!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment blase brexiteers need to think again","story":"Recent polls suggest that a troublingly high percentage of Brexiteers are perfectly willing to pay what we consider to be unacceptably high prices for the UK to leave the EU.When it comes to both the Good Friday Agreement which secured peace in Northern Ireland and Scotland’s continued membership of the UK, a great many Leavers in England have adopted the view thatthese things are weakened by Brexit then that’s le and we shall all have to get on with it.This blasé attitude to such incredibly sensitive issues give us all pause for thought.

This may be so – but nor did anyone vote for a Brexit that threatened peace in Northern Ireland or undermined the integrity of the UK.Yesterday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Davidson and Mundell’s position was “bizarre”. In fact, there is some logic to their stance. From a unionist point of view, any agreement that gave Northern Ireland status denied to Scotland would, inevitably, play into the SNP’s hands.It is the view of The Scotsman that continued peace in Northern Ireland is more important than the delivery of a “hard Brexit”for which nobody explicitly voted.May is under intense pressure from within Conservative ranks to walk away from the EU without a deal. The truth is, however, that she should make the case for the UK remaining within the customs union. The price for leaving it is, we believe, too high.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4815010.1539598509!/image/image.jpg","title":"letters reply to a no voter here s why scotland must leave the union","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...In response to a challenge from a No voter in our letters pages last week, one pro-independence Scotsman reader presents some #straightforward facts# on separation.There are some very straightforward facts to answer Douglas Cowe’s basic questions on independence .: Letters: Dear Scottish independence supporters, persuade a No voter you’re rightQ: Why was Andrew Wilson’s Report, which confirms years of austerityScotland becomes independent, being ignored and not debated at the SNP conference - Far from being ignored, Andrew Wilson’s Growth Commission was debated at three all-day assemblies, involving hundreds of participants, with more to come.Q: If independent, Andrew Wilson confirms Scotland would be carrying a massive deficit, how will this deficit be reduced without incurring substantial tax increases, a reduction in public services and no Barnett Formula payments -The GERS “deficit” of £ billion includes several items that don’t get spent in Scotland, such as a theoretical £.bn a year for Scotland’s “share” of interest on the UKnational debt, or the £.bn charged as a pro rata share of UK defence when less than half that amount is spent in Scotland. With oil prices around  a barrel,an independent Scotland levied taxes at the UK  levels it would bring in £bn a year.Combined, these items would almost wipe out the GERS \u2028deficit. Q: Why is the democratic No vote of  not being respected - It has emerged that the NO vote on  was built on a tissue of lies and, having been taken out of the EU against our democratic wishes, the SNP now holds two democratic mandates in  and  backing another independence referendum.Q: Why would the SNP have us become independent only to try to have Scotland apply to Brussels to become part of a larger, more expensive and more regulated body - Small nations have much greater say in EU decision making, and often have a veto, whereas Scotland is regularly ignored without any say on UK decisions such as the Brexit negotiations.\u2028Q: If independent, what sort of defence force would Scotland have - Scotland can have the same type of defence set-up as other small northern European countries at half the cost the UK charges Scotland under the GERS figures.Economically, the UK remains the most unequal country in Europe, whereby London sucks government infrastructure investment at the expense of the rest of the UK.Also, Scotland’s GDP per head is greater than France or Germany’s.

Often it was on his campaign poster instead of his name and his book The Audacity of Hope put him on the electoral map and inspired people around the world. What would using the word “Hope” do for our First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in her closing address to the SNP conference  The word “Hope” worked wonders for Barack Obama. Often it was on his campaign poster instead of his name and his book The Audacity of Hope put him on the electoral map and inspired people around the world. What would using the word “Hope” do for our First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in her closing address to the SNP conference  Well, choosing that very word showed she was audacious, but then we knew that already, for blaggers usually are, are they not  What “Hope” could Nicola Sturgeon offer me, I wondered I could hope the First Minister would take a further independence referendum off the table and get back to doing the day job she is paid more than the Prime Minister for doing. I might hope she would reiterate education is her top priority rather than tell us independence transcends all – but I was disappointed beyond hope. Nicola Sturgeon managed to mention education only once in her entire speech but could talk of independence  times – telling us there is still hope for a second independence referendum and still hope she and her fellow separatists can win it.I could hope that in trying to convince sceptical unionists who might be persuaded to switch to her cause she would explain how her new business case for independence, produced by her own Growth Commission, would make independence attractive and possible.Sadly it was not mentioned, indeed it was not debated at the SNP conference at all. Apparently it does not give any cause for hope, unless you hope for its super Scottish austerity recipe that would make anything suffered by Greece look like a Club - holiday.Like Nicola Sturgeon I hope for better things. I hope to see our local authorities properly funded rather than starved of cash, but first I’d have to hope the First Minister could explain why she is cutting council funding when her own budget from Westminster has gone up.I hope to see the falling literacy and numeracy among Scottish children reversed, I hope to see our national performance in maths and science improve to at least where it was before the SNP allowed it to fall, and I hope to see the £ million cut in education restored. Unfortunately I have no hope our First Minister will reverse the negative trends in our schools she talks of priorities but cannot even deliver an Education Bill to parliament and would rather increase budgets to other favoured departments than her claimed first priority of education.I hope to see the growing shortages of nurses and doctors reversed, but first she would have to explain why she cut back on training places for nurses when health secretary, why doctors should be taxed more in Scotland than England and why Scottish pupils with excellent exam grades are being denied places in our own medical schools. These scandals leave me without hope that she is up to the job required.Indeed the ambition of my hope has fallen so low I even hope that one day, sometime within my letime, the Queensferry Crossing will not have to close lanes so the ever-present “snagging” can be attended to. Is that too much to hope I have a long list of improvements to Scottish public services but I no longer hope Nicola Sturgeon has even a scintilla of an idea what to do to improve them for all she appears able to talk about is independence, Brexit and blaming Westminster for her failings.I’m not alone in hoping the First Minister would recognise Brexit presents opportunities that she should maximise to at least mitigate what she sees as the dangers. I could provide her with a list of positive initiatives to take but I don’t hold out any hope of being asked for it.I could hope she would promise to fight to keep our fishermen out of the Common Fisheries Policy, but she promises to hand their hard won freedom back over to Brussels. I could hope she would join the campaign for free ports that could bring thousands of jobs to Prestwick and Grangemouth, but she would rather Scotland was inside the EU’s single market and customs union, which would make it impossible.I often hope that Nicola Sturgeon would stop patronising and disrespecting those who do not share her goals. We are not idiots, we can see when a grievance is being manufactured, we can recognise when she is saying black is white and we find her easy sacrice of good relations with the rest of the UK embarrassing. It gives me no hope that she could run an independent Scotland and ensure cordial relationships with our nearest and most important neighbour.Such is the damage done to Scotland during Nicola Sturgeon’s time in office, from Health Secretary through to First Minister, I hope readers who agree with me about the effrontery of her limited offer of “hope” to only those that follow her – rather than the whole of Scotland – might, when they are given the chance, choose to vote the SNP out of power. More so, I hope the Scottish people will bury their past dferences and vote for any party best placed to defeat sitting SNP MSPs or MPs so we may begin to heal the open wounds and deep ision that has grown in Scottish society since the SNP took office. After all the  hopes, all the dashed hopes, I now only hope for one thing and one thing only. I hope the First Minister in all seriousness stands in front of the mirror to consider her litany of bad judgment calls and asks herself why she has failed on so many counts. She has failed on education, she has failed on health, she is failing on the economy – and by ignoring her day job has left us without hope. If she is then honest with herself, she must recognise her audacity has set back her hope of independence – for which I suppose I should be grateful.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4814881.1539550978!/image/image.jpg","title":"universal credit needs 2bn extra says iain duncan smith","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The UK government must pump # billion into welfare in this month#s Budget to save its flagship Universal Credit reform, Iain Duncan Smith has said.The architect of the troubled Universal Credit system quit in  over billions being cut from the new benefits scheme.Criticism of the welfare overhaul, which is currently being rolled out nationally, has grown following reports that the Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told Cabinet colleagues that claimants could lose as much as £ per month in benefits.Mr Duncan Smith said topping up funding was the only way of reaching the “just about managing” people that Prime Minister Theresa May had promised she would help.He said in a TV interview: “Theresa May stood on the steps of Downing Street and said, ‘I want to look after those who are just about managing’.“Universal Credit is the single best system to get to those who are just about managing.He added: “The key thing is, the structure works, but we need to put the money in …we do that and get the money back to where it should be, the reality is nobody should lose at all.”SNP deputy Westminster leader Kirsty Blackman called on the Chancellor to halt the scheme when he delivers the Budget at the end of October. She said: “Millions of families have suffered from years of failed Tory austerity cuts that have seen real wages fall, social security payments slashed, living costs rise, and the majority of families left poorer and worse off than they would have been a decade ago.“The Tory government’s record on living standards has been utterly miserable – with rising poverty and inequality, and plans for an extreme ­Brexit that it knows will deliver a body blow to incomes and living costs across Scotland and the UK.”Shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti said the UC name was now a “toxic brand” and it would be “very hard to rebuild trust in it”.She said: “The problem with Universal Credit now, is, under this government, it is being used to cut people’s benefits – to penalise people for having too many children, to penalise the disabled and other vulnerable people. The notion of a simpler benefits system – great idea, but notyou are adding austerity to it.”Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry called for a root and branch review of Universal Credit.Ms Thornberry said former chancellor George Osborne had used UC as “a vehicle for cuts because it’s so complex you could introduce a whole load of cuts and nobody would notice”.She added: “We must not come out of austerity on the backs of the poor. This is wrong, it’s fundamentally wrong.”Speaking on the same programme, Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the system, saying: “I have seen the Universal Credit in operation in my own constituency, where I have had no letters [about problems] on it at all.“I have sat with the work coaches meeting people who are on Universal Credit and seen how the way that it works means that people can be helped into work much more.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4814945.1539591856!/image/image.jpg","title":"royal baby prince harry and meghan markle expecting baby","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are #very pleased# that Meghan is expecting a baby in the spring of , Kensington Palace has said.Kensington Palace said in a statement: “Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of .: Royal Baby: When is Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s baby due, what will it be called and what will the baby’s title be “Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.”The exciting news comes just hours after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex touched down in Sydney for their first international tour.Meghan told The Queen and the rest of the Royal Family the happy news at Princess Eugenie’s wedding, it was reported.: Royal Wedding: What does Princess Eugenie do for a living, where is she in line to the throne and what is her title ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation on number of lerwick off licences ","story":"The isles licensing board has agreed there is a potential #overprovision# of off-licences in Lerwick.However, a further consultation is to take place before the board can formally agree there is an overprovision in the town.The issue was again discussed by councillors at a meeting on Tuesday, with the meeting being told that overprovision had been the #most dficult issue# as the board looks to set its new three-year policy statement.NHS Shetland has continued to make the case that there are too many off-licences in Lerwick, and public health chief Elizabeth Robinson has said there is a connection between accessing drink and alcohol abuse and impact on health. raquoTake tesco and co op licence and you take care of % of sales in LerwickAbsolute nonsense# If too many off license premises were to blame for alcohol abuse then the likes of Spain and Portugal would be flooded with alcoholics as there are a higher quantity of shops there selling booze.The problem is with the drinking culture in Shetland.Want to point the finger Try looking at the likes of the pubs that serve people till they can no longer talk or the likes of up helly aa where drinking is almost considered part of the festival.Im really concerned at the drinking culture amongst the younger generation.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me.

She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry. That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8665582.1539267946!/image/image.jpg","title":"tv how many young people were caught without a tv licence in your area","story":"With  per cent of undergraduates aged  and under in the UK,TV Licensing is reminding students they could face prosecution and a fine of up to £,they are caught watching live TV, or BBC programmes on iPlayer, on any device, without a TV Licence.Today the young evader numbers are revealed in specic locations.Derry Londonderry:  young people were caught without a TV LicenceCounry Tyrone:  young people were caught without a TV LicenceArmagh Banbridge Craigavon:  young people were caught without a TV LicenceAntrim Newtownabbey:  young people were caught without a TV LicenceNorth Down:  young people were caught without a TV LicenceBallymena Ballymoney:  young people were caught without a TV LicenceKaren Grimason, spokesperson for TV Licensing, said: \"ldquoEvery year there are myths which circulate around campus about when you do and donrsquot need a licence. \"As most students own at least one device capable of showing live TV or watching BBC iPlayer - such as a laptop, smartphone or tablet computer ndash itrsquos important they know the law around being correctly licensed. \"If yoursquore watching live TV on any device, including mobiles and tablets, or watch catch up programmes on BBC iPlayer, you need to be covered by a TV Licence.

Angela and John with some of the trophies Angela Jeffers, , a technology and design technician at Hazelwood Integrated College, and her husband John, , operations trainer at Belfast International Airport, started as casual dancers but in the past few years have stepped up to competition level.This summer they were the sole representatives from NI to take part in the Dance Promoters Association’s showpiece in Bournemouth where they were crowned Closed UK Champions in the Over  Beginners category. They also picked up third place in the Over s Novice bracket.Angela, who is originally from Ashton-under-Lyne near Manchester, said: “We’re both kept very busy with our jobs but we’ve our weekends free to devote to dancing. We fly over to Liverpool on a Friday night for a lesson for two hours, have a competition on the Sunday and then fly home on Monday morning and go straight back into work.”Along with her husband John who comes from Crumlin, they have picked up an impressive haul of trophies with the prizes they received at the Bournemouth Summer Festival taking pride of place.   Angela and John Jeffers in action “We were up against so many good dancers,” said Angela. “We were astounded to finish with a first and a third place.”She added: “We started dancing lessons just after we got married, so that’s about  years ago, but the competitions we’ve been doing for less than three years.“It never even occurred to us to take lessons before we got married for the first dance. We got married in a very small castle hotel near Edinburgh. We didn’t have a disco anyway, we had a magician instead.”Askedthe dance competitions the pair took part in looked in any way like Strictly Come Dancing, Angela said: “I always worry that all people see of dancing is Strictly. That’s more like show dancing.    Angela and John Jeffers “Competition dancing is not like Strictly whatsover. Our routines are based on trying to get the footwork correct, the timing, the posture.“People think they’re going to see us throwing each other around over our heads. What we do is proper dancing.“For example, to go through the steps of the foxtrot is not dficult, it’s making it look like a foxtrot that is the skill. If someone is dancing and you’re watching them through a window, would you know what dance they are doing  Most times it just looks like they’re walking around the room.”Police investigating link between Ballymena break-ins Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"She added: “In Strictly when you see the smoke on the floor, they’re hiding their feet. The amount of time they spend out of hold, floating about wasting time, that wouldn’t happen in a proper competition.   John and Angela dressed for their appearance in Lost City of Z “I think people who watch Strictly will end up having an unrealistic expectation about dancing. They think you can learn to dance in a week. If we all had a professional training us for  hours a day maybe we could.“It takes a lot longer when you’re only doing one lesson a week which is closer to the norm because of time and money. We go three times a week, maybe spend about five or six hours practising, but that’s because we’re in competitions.”Detailing how they began dancing, Angela said: “It was something that I always wanted to do. We saw this advertisement in a shop in Randalstown for Bob Lindsay’s social dancing class.“My husband started as a reluctant dancer, he really only did it for me. Although he does enjoy it a lot more now.”The pair moved on to Clarke’s Dance Studios in Belfast before getting tuition from Paul Taylor, a professional dancer from Liverpool.Angela said: “I remember being a bag of nerves before our first competition in England. But as we stepped up our lessons our technique, footwork and timing improved. As we did more competitions we started getting a few firsts.“Sadly there aren’t really any competitions in Northern Ireland so mostly we go to England or down to Ireland.“You don’t really do it for the prizes, it’s for personal achievement. We’re all in it together. You get quite friendly with the people you’re dancing against. It can be emotionally draining.”More than being just a hobby that fills their weekends, the couple’s dancing has proved important for John’s health.Angela said: “John had le saving heart surgery seven years ago. He had an aortic aneurism and calcied aortic valve.“He had both replaced in a seven hour operation, at the Royal and was back dancing – gently – after four weeks. “He used the dancing to help rebuild his strength and fitness.” On October , Angela and John will be reunited with their first dance teacher Bob Lindsay for a demonstration in Ballyclare Town Hall.Through their dancing the couple ended up in the feature film ‘Lost City of Z’ in a ballroom scene.John has also appeared on television in an episode of Countryfile looking at the hare population at Belfast International Airport where he works.try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1077173.jpg--.jpg?1539084908000\n","title":"public mystified by disappearing planters","story":"LOCAL people have been mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church. Council simply said they are now being stored at a Council yard.Meanwhile people have also been concerned as to the whereabouts of the original town centre bandstand.The plan for this was for it to be re-established in the Peoples Park, however this has not yet happened.When thecontacted Council for a statement, they said: “We are delighted with the success to date of Harmony Hub – our borough’s newest and state-of-the-art outdoor entertainment venue.“Harmony Hub has showcased a wide range of talented local artists since it opened earlier this year and we look forward to welcoming more great performances and attractions.Speaking about the original bandstand, the Council confirmed they have plans for it.“The old bandstand was carefully dismantled so it can be preserved and relocated to the People’s Park.“We are currently working on plans for this installation and more information will be made available in due course.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1065046.jpg--.jpg?1538637007000\n","title":"tension in chamber over gaa dinner","story":"AN INVITE for councillors to a GAA gala dinner stoked up tensions in the Council chamber last week.A request from St Ergnats GAC to invite members of Mid and East Antrim to the Tullyglass on November  was read to members.It followed an item on the agenda with members being invited to a gala dinner in support of NI Childrens Hospice.Members had agreedthey were to attend the hospice dinner that they would purchase their own tickets.When the GAA dinner was raised Councillor Carson proposed to mark it as read as the club was not located in the Mid and East Antrim boundary lines.However Councillor Declan OLoan said the club was located in Moneyglass which fell very close to the border and that a lot of players at the club lived within the Mid and East Antrim Borough.He added: This is an outstanding club like many others in the area who raise a lot of money and doesnt depend on its council for support.I would propose we do the same for this as we are doing for the hospice.Councillor Gaston seconded Councillor Carsons proposal to mark the invitation as read.If anyone wishes to attend this they should go in their own capacity.Councillor Maguire added that the issue of location of the club should not come into the decision.He added: If I remember correctly some members of this Council attended a dinner in Lurgan or Portadown for the British Legion so that set a precedent.I would second what Councillor OLoan has said and treat this invite similar to that of the hospice dinner.Councillor Gaston added that both invitations were completely dferent.The Northern Ireland Hospice does sterling work and is for the benefit of people all over Northern Ireland. It is not just for a section of the community.Councillor Carsons proposal to mark the invite as read was carried with a vote of  in favour.The event is to mark the clubs th anniversary with special guests including champion jockey Tony McCoy.It will be held in the Tullyglass Hotel on November .

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics.

But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch.

Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism.

As the underdogs, some may feel that St John’s had their chance the first day as favourites have a habit of winning replays. However, St John’s manager Tony McNulty sees it dferently and has urged his side to make to most of Sunday’s second chance to reach the county final. “We just took our foot of the pedal in the last few minutes. I said before the game that we had to play for  or  minutes and we only played for  minutes,” said McNulty. “We were four or five points ahead late on and we just switched off. “We switched off long enough for them to get their goal and it was nervous at the end. While we scored to draw the game, we felt we had done enough to win the game. “We’ll not be going into this match thinking we’ve missed the boat. “When Neil McManus hit that free I though “here we go again” – thankfully Ciaran Johnston stepped up and scored his free. We were disappointed having led not to hold on.“We can’t afford to switch off again – Cushendall are too good. When you have players like Neil McManus, Arron Graffin and Alex Delargy, we can’t afford to. I can’t see there being much in the game again this Sunday.” McNulty also gave his views on the worrying scenes which marred the end of the match when two Cushendall supporters jumped over the wire at Dunloy to confront the St John’s players in the dying minutes of the game. With such incidents in the spotlight in recent weeks, the intruders could have sparked a much more serious flashpoint, but order was soon restored. While McNulty condemned the actions of those involved, he feared the game might have been brought to a premature end with his side one point in arrears at the time. “There was a bit of carryon at the sideline which had nothing to do with us,” reflected McNulty “The ball was in among four or five Cushendall men and one of their players pulled on it.“He hit his own player and one of our players. It resulted in a bit of pushing – nothing serious. “Two of their supporters jumped over the wire. “I don’t know why, but they started throwing punches until the players got them off the pitch. “I was glad the referee continued the game and gave us the chance to equalise and thankfully the people were identied.” It is believed that the Cushendall player who was struck by his own teammate was Antrim ace Eoghan Campbell, who is likely to miss Sunday’s replay as a result of the hand injury sustained late in the drawn encounter. St John’s will also be without one of their leading players for the remainder of the campaign after attacker Donal Carson departed for Australia last week, but Simon McCrory is expected to be fit to play a greater role in the replay having played the second half in the drawn game. “Donalis away to Australia so that’s a big blow for us,” added McNulty. “I don’t know what happened, but there was something about the dates and he couldn’t get them changed. “It is unfortunate because he has been playing well for us. “In nearly every game, he has scored a goal for us. If Campbell is out for them, it evens things up a bit. “Simon McCrory should be good to go. He is a super player for us and he has been outstanding in every game he has played this year. He wasn’t right for the last game. All being well, the two-week break will do him good.” McNulty will also have the task of lting the dual players in the club following their semi-final football defeat at the hands of Creggan last Sunday. Senior finalists in , the Johnnies were edged out - to - by Kevin Madden’s men at Glenavy, but McNulty, whose son Ryan is a key member of both squads, doesn’t think the dual players will suffer any hangover from that defeat. “We are disappointed, but we have to hang in,” stated the Johnnies boss. “We didn’t play as well as we can do on Sunday, so we can have no complaints. “Things conspired against us on the day. Simon McDonagh’s we went into labour on Sunday morning so he was unavailable. Peter McCallin wasn’t back from holiday in time. “We had six or seven dual players in action on Sunday who will feature again this weekend. “They’ll lt themselves up alright. “It would have been great to going into the match trying to reach two senior finals, but we have to focus on Sunday’s game now.” With Division One winners and  champions Dunloy out following their surprise loss to Loughgiel, the remaining sides will all fancy their chances of lting the Volunteer Cup later this month. The Shamrocks will get a chance to view their final opponents over the course of  minutes in Ballycastle on Sunday, but it would come as no great surprisean additional  minutes was required to separate St John’s and Cushendall."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"officials stay tight lipped over broken promise to clear kerbs","story":"OVER a year after kerbs at the entrance to Holy Cross Girls’ Primary School were painted red, white and blue by loyalists the Department for Infrastructure is remaining tight-lipped over its promise to clear up the mess.The kerbs at the school were painted in the run-up to last year’s marching season, but a community agreement to remove the paint was later reached.In October last year, the Department told us that after being asked to remove the paint it was seeking the necessary funds to have the work carried out.“The Department can confirm that it received a request for the removal of paint from the kerbs at the entrance to Holy Cross Girls’ School,” a spokesperson said at the time.“As it has been established that there is cross-community agreement for the removal of paint from all kerbs in the area, the local Division is currently seeking funding to have the work carried out.”The North Belfast News has spent a week trying to obtain an update on the state of play – but we have received no answer to our queries.There was widespread disappointment that the paint wasn’t removed in time for the children ing to school last month and local people are still in the dark as to when the paint will be removed.North Belfast Sinn Féin Councillor Ryan Murphy said: “It is unacceptable that the kerbstones at the front of Holy Cross Girls’ School have still not had red, white and blue paint removed from them.“A commitment was made long over a year ago for this to be done yet the paint is still there and a new school year has begun.“We are now seeing tension around the interface areas in North Belfast decrease, in line with this the Department should act and remove this paint, which was done in the summer of .“ I have written to the Department for Infrastructure to ask why their commitment was not followed through and for them to provide me with a timeframe for this work to be finished.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"relax and reset at the slieve donard","story":"AN invitation to indulge in an afternoon of post summer skin restoration was readily accepted by this reporter at the luxurious Slieve Donard Resort and Spa.With the last of the summer wardrobe packed away, spa clients were filing through the spa doors in buttoned up jackets, hats and scarfs keen to comfort their bodies in the resort’s numerous heady packages of rest and relaxation. I was booked into try their Interstellar Relaxation Experience with the package tailored to leave the senses ‘other worldly’.A warm welcome was extended at the spa entrance as my battered Converse were taken away to be swtly replaced with a cosy pair of slippers. After changing I met with my therapist for the afternoon, Leanne, who explained that the experience would entail a pressure point foot massage, hot stone back, neck and shoulder massage, regenerating jasmine infused facial with warming Space Mask and to finish a chance to sip over a glass of flora jasmine tea.Having an almost -month- year-old son, bag, baggage, pram, and the everyday ‘essentials’ to cover that role, my back and shoulders were in dire need of a serious overhaul and I was more than happy to let Leanne knead, massage and crack away at the numerous knots accumulated over the past two years.Having chose a detoxying body oil for the duration of the treatment, Leanne explained that the ingredients would still be working their magic  hours after, so Monday could be faced head on. Combining the very finest in the Spa’s renowned ESPA range, Leanne used the Optimal Skin Procleanser which acts as a cleaner, exfoliator and mask for visibly radiant skin, hydrating cleansing milk and from their age-defying range – which I was all for – the Tri-Active Advanced Instant Facial with the Regenerating Face Treatment Oil and Lt and Firm Mask. The treatment was further complimented with a pressure point foot massage and application of the very latest in beauty utopia, the self heating Spacemask, which works to relieve tiredness, eye strain and many other ‘earthly tensions’.ESPA’s Pink Hair and Scalp Mask was then applied to enhance the Tibetan scalp massage. By this stage I was wondering how I was going to get off the bed such was my relaxed state and as Leanne handed me a glass of flora jasmine and rose tea I felt completely chilled.The chance to enjoy the spa facilities – not too mention the spectacular scenery – is another added bonus of the treatment and helps to suspend the fact you have toto reality before the end of the day.We are all guilty of not making enough time for ourselves in modern society with many of us trying and in many cases failing to find the right mix of work le balance. The Spa at Slieve Donard’s staff, therapists and especially their autumn Interstellar package ensure that those who partake, their minds and bodies are transported to a better place – for a few hours at least. The Interstellar Relaxation autumn day spa experience runs until November . The treatment is priced at £ Monday-Friday at the Culloden Spa or £ at the Slieve Donard Spa.

We also cannot thank Ciaran Cunningham of Michael Brentnall Solicitors enough for his help with getting this disgraceful decision overturned.“Roisin still has a huge battle ahead of her but we believe this new treatment will be successful, her new treatment is very tough on her, Roisin’s cancer is a very fast growing cancer, her new treatment is making her very lethargic and it has nasty side effects but she is prepared, she knows what she is up against and she will continue to fight.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

However there remain a number of unresolved issues relating to the backstop.\"A senior UK source suggested Brussels had sought to promote the idea a deal had been reached before the meeting so it would \"look like we are the ones being intransigent\".But with Mrs May under increasing pressure from Tory Eurosceptics and her DUP parliamentary allies, the Government also has a reason to appear to be taking a tough line.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis has urged a Cabinet revolt against the Prime Ministers approach to the talks.The issue of the backstop - a mechanism to avoid a hard border - is at the heart of the troubles facing Mrs May as she attempts to secure a deal. The EU version of the backstop, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brussels rules, has been called unacceptable by Mrs May and is loathed by the DUP.Mrs Mays counter-proposal is for a \"temporary customs arrangement\" for the whole UK, but Tory Brexiteers fear this becoming an open-ended position that would prevent free trade deals with countries around the world.Last night DUP MP Jim Shannon echoed party leader Arlene Fostersprediction in a leaked email that a no-deal Brexit was increasingly likely.\"If the EU insist that Northern Ireland is treated dferently from the rest of the UK, then there is only one option - no deal,\" he stated.He said that though it was neither his nor the DUPs preferred outcome, operating under World Trade Organisationrules after a hard Brexit was nothing to be afraid of. That would be preferable to Northern Ireland being \"annexed\" by the EU, as would be the case under present EU plans, Mr Shannon said.He also said the Cabinet was concerned about the potential loss of DUP support, which it relies on in the House of Commons for key votes.\"Weve made it very clear to them thatthe Prime Minister goes ahead with any sort of a deal which makes Northern Irelands position within the UK dferent from anywhere , then there will be repercussions,\" he said. \"Were not joking. Were not going to take any watering down of Northern Irelands place in the UK.\"He added that the DUP deal with the Tories was at stake: \"If she lets us down on this, it can only go one way, and it will be a sad day for her.\"Ahead of her meeting with the Prime Minister, Ms McDonald said the DUP had aligned itself with \"the hard right of the Brexiteers at the cost of imposing a hard border in Ireland\".She added: \"The DUP do not represent the majority of people in the North on Brexit, nor our economic interests, and oppose the Good Friday Agreement.\"They cannot be allowed to set the pace for Brexit or political progress in the North.\"Meanwhile, Tory MP Nadine Dorries suggested Mr Davis should be installed as interim leader, claiming that was the only way to secure the kind of free trade deal Brexit demanded by Eurosceptics.But Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who was hosting eight EU counterparts at his Chevening country retreat, said \"there is no one who is going to be able to negotiate the right deal for Britain better than Theresa May\", adding \"she is battling for Britain\"."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan and harry broke pregnancy news to queen at eugenies wedding","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Master Cadets must successfully complete a demanding course designed to broaden and develop further the leadership, instructional and administrative responsibilities of senior Cadets who have already attained the prestigious Four Star Army Proficiency Certicate.The certicates were presented recently by Gillian Bingham, High Sherf of County Antrim.Congratulating the young people, Colonel Sam McCammond, Commandant of the ndBattalion Army Cadet Force, said: ldquoWe are delighted to see the enthusiasm and commitment of our Cadets recognised with the achievement of these latest accolades.ldquoWe are enormously proud of them and, indeed, they are each a credit not only to their detachments, but also to their families, schools and the wider community.ldquoAt a time when society tends to be quick to find fault with the younger generation, these young people are demonstrating great qualities and it is an absolute pleasure to see them reap the rewards of their hard work and sense of purpose.Col McCammond said the Cadet movement offers its members ldquogreat fun and camaraderie and also ldquoopens the door for signicant personal development.He continued: The awards which these Cadets, drawn from detachments at Down High School, Banbridge, Ballygowan and Killyleagh, collect today celebrate their progress and give our Cadets something truly signicant to put on their personal statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs.ldquoI congratulate them and the adult leaders who inspire and instruct them..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown until doors open at new Down Leisure Centre  ","story":"THE new poundm Down Leisure Centre will open at the end of next month.The stunning three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels and has the ldquowow factor Newry, Mourne and Down Council always promised it would have.Stretching across , square metres, council officials have no doubt the futuristic building will be the envy of many and viewed as an exemplar for others.The new centre features a  metre, six-lane swimming pool, a teaching pool with moveable floor, relaxation area with sauna, steam room and vitality pool along with a four-court multi-use sports hall.There is also a fantastic fitness suite with an extensive selection of equipment with some items the first of their kind to feature in any leisure centre in Ireland. The new centre also has two multi-purpose exercise studios featuring hi-tech spinning bikes.Council officials have this week set out the programme for closing the current leisure centre and opening its stunning replacement.Itrsquos anticipated that the existing leisure centre mdash which has long since passed its sell-by date mdash will close early next month. The new centre is expected to open three weeks later.When the door closes on the current facility, which will be subsequently bulldozed to pave the way for the construction of an expansive new car park, staff will transfer to the new multi-million pound centre for dedicated training and induction.Council officials are drawing up a programme ahead of the official opening to provide members of sports clubs and the public with an opportunity to sample what the new st century leisure centre has to offer and a chance to view its high-tech equipment.It is hoped the new centrersquos public launch will take place over the weekend of November  and  with full public access from November . These dates have to be confirmed.During the transition from the old centre to its modern replacement, the public are asked to use the local authorityrsquos nearby facilities at the Ballymote Health and Well-Being Centre in Downpatrick and the Newcastle Centre.Council officials are delighted with the new centre, in particular, the new teaching pool which has a moveable floor.Over recent years, there has been increasing pressure on swimming classes at Down Leisure Centre.Council officials are confident this will soon ease and are grateful to the public for their patience during the construction process.There are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room mdash the new leisure complexrsquos nerve centre mdash resembling something akin to a science fiction film set.Council director Michael Lipsett has described the new centre as a ldquofantastic building which people will appreciate and enjoy. He said it will also be a pleasure for the local authorityrsquos leisure staff to move to a modern building.The senior council official said everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially, deserve credit for the part they played..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down High pupils make waves at RYA  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos sailors took to the water at the weekend with over  others to battle it out at the RYA Northern Ireland Youth Championships and Schools Cup at Cultra.The sailors from the Downpatrick school battled hard in tough conditions, with a special mention to going to Adam Fermor, sailing in the Laser Standard fleet, who made a clean sweep, with five first place podium finished from five races.Evie Mclaughlin also performed impressively, finishing as third lady overall, in the Laser Radial Fleet.

Itrsquos important we give riders some idea how to handle their machines.ldquoIrsquove had teachers from schools in Newcastle and Ballynahinch ands members of local road safety committees all expressing interest in the idea, he told the Recorder this week.ldquoWe are waiting now to hear the police reaction and then we can get together and work out something definite.Mr McBridersquos concern comes with a rising number of motorcycle accidents in the province. In the Ballynahinch area alone there have been several serious accidents this year.Among the proposals he has suggested to augment his own coaching course is specially built lsquotrail parksrsquo and an elementary riding test before anyone is allowed to buy a machine.ldquoPeople must know how to ride their machines safely, he said. Balance and technique are important.ldquoAnother important area is maintenance.

Four members, Billy Ogle, Felton Williamson, Sam Harrison and Joe Toland were flagged off from the Slieve Donard Hotel to start their marathon visitation around Ireland.Every Round Table in Ireland will be visited and a competition has been organised to guess the number of miles the journey will take. Each Round Table has received tickets on which you can guess the mileage on the car when the journey ends.Fty pence is the price per guess and the winner will receive pound. In this way, the Round Table hope to raise in excess of pound, for their selected charity. The drivers will be collecting the ticket stubs from each Round Table as they visits the towns.The drive began on Tuesday at  noon and with a bit of luck and safe driving the boys should be at their last port of call in Wexford on Friday. The winning ticket will be announced at lunch on Sunday.DOWNPATRICK mdash Window-smashing, ransacking vandals left their trademark on yet another school last week when they broke into St Patrickrsquos Boysrsquo Primary School in Downpatrick.The St Dillonrsquos Avenue school was badly vandalised with the tuck shop destroyed, windows and door  smashed and ious types of equipment wrecked.The latest incident happened last Wednesday night and came less than a week after police had been allied to see the extent of the damage caused by vandals at the nearby St Maryrsquos Secondary School on the Ardglass Road.On that occasion pictures and statues were knocked off walls and broken and several other items, including doors, were badly damaged. Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Primark says it is doing all it can to resolve the issue of the safety cordon around their main Belfast store, which was destroyed by fire in August. Liam McBurney PA Wire It said the proposed works were “required to facilitate further investigations on the structural integrity of Bank Buildings” following the recent fire which completely destroyed the store.But revealing that the proposal “has not been approved”, a spokesperson for Primark said: “Bank Buildings is a listed building of historic signicance to Belfast and we are committed to a conservation led approach. In order to start work on the building, Primark is required to undertake a specic planning process which is very complex and involves a wide range of stakeholders. We are fully engaged in this process and while it is ongoing, we are also working at full capacity on finding a way to reduce the cordon and open up the Castle Place junction.“On nd October we submitted a proposal that could have reduced the cordon within weeks, unfortunately this proposal has not been approved but we are committed to finding a solution and are working closely with the council to agree this.“We recognise how important this is to Belfast city and once we have permission to start work, the reduced cordon will be put in place as quickly as possible.”The spokesperson added: “Primark acknowledges the impact that the devastating fire at Bank Buildings has had on Belfast. We are committed to the business and wider community and have recently made a £, donation to Belfast City Council’s City Recovery Investment Programme. This fund is being allocated by the council to those local businesses impacted by the fire. We also recognise that Primark has always been a driver of footfall into the city centre and we are determined to be up and trading as soon as we can.”Belfast City Council has been approached for comment on the issue.• Read related story: Primark fire sparks dramatic fall in Belfast city centre footfallJohnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8667712.1539377708!/image/image.jpg","title":"education","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Education   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Education Politics Crime Farming Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Education      Orange Order defends role in lsquoraising educational attainmentrsquoThe Orange Order has defended its role in helping address educational under-achievement among young working class Protestants.

When the Republic ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth the UK government responded with the Ireland Act , which guaranteed that Northern Ireland would not cease to remain a part of the UK ‘without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland’.    Alex Kane A year after that parliament was prorogued the  Northern Ireland Constitution Act declared that, ‘Northern Ireland remains part of Her Majesty’s dominions and of the United Kingdom, and it is hereby affirmed that in no event will Northern Ireland or any part of it cease to be part of Her Majesty’s dominions and of the United Kingdom without the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll held for the purpose...’ Then,  years later, the  Northern Ireland Act rejigged the  Act,requiring a referendum onlyit ‘appears likely’ to pass, followed by unity negotiationsit does pass.But what happensa UK government does something which changes the fundamental nature of the relationship between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom  For example, a ‘final deal’ between the UK and the EU which leaves Northern Ireland still in and subject to EU regulations, while the rest of the UK is out. In other words, of what use is the ‘constitutional guarantee’Westminster has the power to behave in a way which changes the shape and substance of the Union The  Anglo-Irish Agreement did enormous psychological damage to unionism here and dealt a hammer blow to the relationship between unionists and the Conservative party. The unionist parties and electorate believed, rightly I think, that Thatcher had betrayed them. Only a handful of MPs rallied to their side when the agreement was presented to Parliament and it became very clear that they had very few real friends at the political heart of the United Kingdom. Yet, bad though the Anglo-Irish Agreement was, it did not, in fact, undermine the constitutional integrity of the UK.But the body language and press statements of the DUP over the past few weeks suggest that the trust they placed in Theresa May will not be rewarded. Last December – a few days after Arlene Foster was forced to issue her first very public threat to the prime minister – I argued that May,she had the parliamentary arithmetic in her favour, would abandon her agreement with the DUP and push her own deal through the Commons. She was, after all, a Remainer at heart, so why would she jeopardise her preferred deal just to keep the DUP happy  I think the DUP fear she may be now preparing to do just that.   Theresa May could abandon her agreement with Arlene Foster and the DUPshe can get her Brexit deal through parliament The reality is – and always has been – that their power over the prime minister ends at the precise moment when Mrs May has enough votes from across the Commons to offset the votes of the DUP and her own rebels within the European Reform Group. It boils down to how big a hit the prime minister is prepared to take for her Chequers plan –or something very like that plan: and whether a substantial majority of her own MPs accept that a deal which leaves NI inside the EU doesn’t amount to an existential threat to the United Kingdom. The DUP would have hoped that the support of their position from heavyweights like Rees-Mogg and Johnson would have weakened the prime minister’s hand but they failed to land any killer blows on her at the annual conference and it now looks asshe is prepared to stare them down.Anything can happen in the next few days and weeks: it can’t even be taken for granted that May will survive. But we need to face the fact that this is a potentially very dangerous moment for the Union. Indeed, it has the potential to be a catastrophic moment for the Union. The decisions made by May, her government, the House of Commons and the DUP will define the future of the United Kingdom.It is too easy, as well as plain wrong, to say that this is all the direct consequence of Brexit. Yes, the referendum result may have stirred the constitutional pot earlier than expected, but the existential question has been in play for some time. The  Scottish referendum resulted in a   split on independence, with no sign that the question has gone away the rise of Sinn Fein and the shting narrowing demographics in Northern Ireland and the toxicity of the unionist nationalist relationship had put unity at the centre of debate the rise of little-England nationalism had raised questions about the relationship between England and the rest of the UK the rise of nationalist parties across the EU was is challenging the belief that increasing integration must always lead to increasing harmony and trust the upturn in immigration into the EU had produced an us-and-them schism and it is now very clear that millions of people within the EU are more interested in the rights culture traditions of their own state than in the bigger idea of ‘EU citizenship.’ Quite where Northern Ireland will be when the dust of the next few months has settled is not entirely clear. It’s not even clear where pan-UK unionism will be when the dust has settled because, let’s not forget, unionism is more, much more, than Ulster unionism. One thing is certain, though, a deal which pushes Northern Ireland to the window ledge of the United Kingdom would be both stupid and dangerous: as would a hard border. Arlene Foster, Theresa May, the EU and the Irish government must tread very carefully.Newspapers have survived and adapted to centuries of change Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

To date the  Accelerators have raised more than pound, for UK charities between them.The guests were given a tour of the House of Commons before the main event, hosted by Luton MP Gavin Shuker. Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do.

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
