At 1930 the fliers adjourned either to officers\u0027 or sergeants\u0027 messes for the usual pre-flight meal.Security had billed that evening\u0027s activity as merely another round of training, but those with eyes to see noticed that bacon and eggs were being served, luxuries in wartime Britain which were readily accessible only to men not unlikely to be dead before morning in their country\u0027s service. At 2000, ninety minutes before the first take-offs, they drifted towards the crew rooms to strip themselves of personal possessions, don flying kit, collect parachutes, flight bags and flying rations –— chocolate, sandwiches, fruit juice, an orange, chewing gum — and escape equipment, consisting of Dutch and German currency, miniature compass and silk maps.Then they lay on the grass chatting, smoking, in the beauty of a fine summer\u0027s evening. Men solemnly shook the hands of friends and said goodbye.Gibson later described his own sensations at such moments, when almost every flier\u0027s anticipation was at its most acute: \u0027Your stomach feels as though it wants to hit your backbone. You can\u0027t stand still. You laugh at small jokes, loudly, stupidly. You smoke far too many cigarettes, usually only half-way through, then throw them away. Sometimes you feel sick and want to go to the lavatory.\u0027The smallest incidents annoy you and you flare up on the slightest provocation . . . All this because you\u0027re frightened, scared stiff.\u0027He had learned how to conquer it, however, and sometimes showed himself harshly unforgiving towards others who were less fortunate.For all the breezy confidence that most men exuded when among a crowd, Flt Sgt Bill Townsend, a veteran of 26 operations, was convinced that they were all \u0027for the chop\u0027.John Hopgood told Dave Shannon: \u0027I don\u0027t think I\u0027m coming back.\u0027Lewis Burpee, whose wife was expecting their first baby, shook the hand of fellow-Canadian Ken Brown, saying \u0027Goodbye Ken\u0027 with undisguised finality. \u0027One rear-gunner spoke confidently about the occupants of other aircraft who shared their bus to the dispersals: \u0027You know those two crews aren\u0027t coming back, don\u0027t you?\u0027Thirty minutes later, Gibson gave the word: time to go. Buses and trucks bore the airmen to their planes, and they clambered aboard. At 2100 a red light soared from the Very flare pistol of Gibson\u0027s Lancaster, G-George, to signal them to start engines.An airman on the ground gave a thumbs-up, signalling that the wooden wheel stops had been dragged clear, followed by a hiss of air as brakes were released.One by one the big aircraft began to bump across the field.The Reserve Wave crews watched almost in disbelief as the first planes lifted off \u0027with this enormous thing, almost like a garden roller, hanging underneath\u0027.For me, the so-called Dambusters represent an emotional journey from my own childhood, from the day at boarding school when I first thrilled to Richard Todd\u0027s portrayal of Gibson in the most popular British war film of all time, with its stirring march composed by Eric Coates.Both the 1955 film and the book which preceded it made a profound impression on me. I memorised the names of 617\u0027s pilots assembled and painted plastic models of the Avro Lancasters they flew became intimately familiar with Enemy Coast Ahead, Gibson\u0027s posthumously published memoir.I perceived - as did millions of other Britons - a nobility about the bravery displayed that night as these young men, almost all of an age with modern gap-year adolescents, or students at university, lifted their big, clumsy bombers into the air, barely four decades after the Wright brothers initiated heavier-than-air flight, and embarked in cold blood on a mission that would require exceptional courage, skill and luck to succeed, and which many recognised was likely to kill them.For two and a half hours they raced through the moonlit sky towards Germany, at a height that made power cables as deadly a menace as anti-aircraft fire.They then attacked Hitler\u0027s dams, flying straight and level at 220mph, much lower than the treetops and less than a cricket pitch length from the lakes below, to unleash those revolutionary weapons created by the brilliance and persistence of Barnes Wallis. Half of 617\u0027s aircraft which got as far as Germany failed to return, but two of the biggest man-made structures in the world collapsed into mud and rubble.The fliers contrived a feat that caused all the world to wonder — the Allied nations with pride, the German people and their leaders with horror and apprehension.But I now blush to remember how I embraced The Dam Busters with special enthusiasm because the raid seemed victimless, save for the 53 dead among the gallant young men who carried it out.In truth, however, as we will see in more detail later, something approaching 1,400 civilians perished, more than half of them foreign female slaves of Hitler.         The crew of 617 squadron\u0027s G for George board the Lancaster bomber (left to right): Trevor-Roper, Pulford, Deering, Spafford, Hutchison, Guy Gibson, TaerumAlongside our continuing awe for the fliers who breached the dams, the enormity of the horror that they unthinkingly unleashed upon a host of innocents has to be confronted.There was never an easy route from Lincolnshire to the Möhne. Gibson\u0027s aircraft were obliged to brush the Ruhr, the most heavily defended region of Nazi Germany, in order to reach its water supplies in the rural Sauerland beyond.The received wisdom of bombing operations was that height conferred improved prospects of survival, yet for this one mission, the squadron was flying all the way to the target below the threshold at which German radar would pick them up and send in the night-fighters to slaughter them.This, though, put them at the mercy of anti-aircraft guns, which were clustered in belts between the Dutch coast and the dams.Gibson\u0027s three lead aircraft - G-George, P-Popsie and M-Mother - approached Holland but the ground defences, surprised, stayed mute at first as they swept overhead, navigating by map, compass and landmarks: a windmill here, a communications mast there.Fleeting glimpses of houses, factories, railway lines were punctuated at intervals by an intercom yell of \u0027Pull up!\u0027 from the nose, signalling a power line in front. They were flying so low that M-Mother - piloted by \u0027Hoppy\u0027 Hopgood, a 21-year-old who still began his letters home \u0027Dear Mummy\u0027 - passed beneath one set of power lines.They spotted the Wilhelmina Canal, and followed it eastwards until they turned north-east and passed over the German frontier.The flight to the dams was a remarkable affair in its own right, demanding the highest skill, courage and luck, even before the Lancasters launched their attacks.Already for five crews, fate had run against them and they had either crashed (one into a power line) or returned home.The strain for the remaining 14 was immense, dodging flak, becoming briefly lost, flying 30 tons of metal, Perspex, fuel, armament and human flesh as if the Lancasters were stunt planes.But they surged onwards, fields and villages flashing beneath them, until the Rhine came into view and they knew that the industrial conglomeration of the Ruhr lay beyond. The sky erupted as searchlights and light flak raked the darkness around them.Identifying their last turning point just 19 miles from the Möhne, they swung south-east for the last - mercifully uneventful - six minutes of the flight.Just after midnight, Micky Martin in P-Popsie was first to glimpse the Möhne dam, followed seconds later by Gibson, to whom it looked \u0027squat and heavy and unconquerable\u0027.He was relieved to see no sign of searchlights, from which the dazzle could have been fatal to attackers making low-level bomb runs.Instead, there were only angry stabs of light flak, green, yellow and red, streaking up from six German gun positions, the gunners puzzled by the appearance of enemy aircraft.Surely they weren\u0027t hoping to breach the vast Möhne? \u0027Bit aggressive, aren\u0027t they?\u0027 muttered one of Gibson\u0027s crew.Over the VHF radio link, Gibson ordered Hopgood and Martin to orbit the valley while he examined the approach to the dam. Then he joined them as they circled overhead, with three more Lancasters that had just arrived.Of the three target dams, the Möhne offered by far the most open approach, but to fly a heavy bomber head-on towards the guns on the dam walls nonetheless represented an immensely daunting challenge.Gibson told his crew, \u0027Well, boys, I suppose we\u0027d better start the ball rolling.\u0027 Since much about Bomber Command\u0027s fliers echoed the mood of students attempting some supreme athletic challenge, it does not seem frivolous to compare Gibson\u0027s predicament with that of a cricket captain.Under the eyes of his team, he was opening the bowling. It would betray everything that he represented if he let them down, muffed the moment, made a hash of his run.                A wartime photograph showing the damage inflicted by the \u0027Dambusters\u0027 raid on the Eder dam. The RAF\u0027s 617 Squadron used bouncing bombs to breach two dams within Germany during a night attack in May 1943The hydraulic motors were started on the bombs to spin them at the required speed of 500rpm. Gibson announced: \u0027I am going to attack. Stand by to come in to attack in your order when I tell you.\u0027 Then he ed G-George towards the lake, the airframe vibrating as the four-and-a-half ton cylinder packed with explosive spun beneath the bomb bay.As G-George lost height the crew could clearly see everything under the brilliant moonlight — the dam wall, twin towers, sluices. One called from the nose: \u0027Good show. This is wizard\u0027, before suffering a moment\u0027s panic about the proximity of fir trees a few feet beneath him.Then came the vital 45 seconds as they raced at 230mph above the surface of the lake.The navigator switched on the spotlights, saying \u0027Down — down — down\u0027, then \u0027Steady — steady.\u0027 Incoming tracer from the dam wall whipped past and each man braced for a brutal collision between German shells and the thin alloy of the Lancaster.At the wheel, Gibson felt almost overwhelmed by the vastness of the dam looming, his Lancaster suddenly so small.\u0027Left — little more left,\u0027 called out the navigator. \u0027Steady steady — steady — coming up.\u0027 Then: \u0027Mine\u0027s gone!\u0027 The first of Barnes Wallis\u0027s \u0027bouncing bombs\u0027 was on its way.G-George surged sharply upwards with the loss of weight, then Gibson heaved back on the yoke and climbed away.A voice over the radio called from another aircraft: \u0027Good show, leader. Nice work.\u0027 But it wasn\u0027t. The bomb bounced once . . . twice . . . three times — then vanished beneath the surface.A huge explosion sent a column of water shooting high into the night sky and the lake surface boiled, yet as minutes passed and the lake calmed, the dam still stood.Disappointment was crushing for Gibson. The evidence suggests that his bomb was dropped early, causing it to sink before striking the dam wall. After his extraordinary exertions, not least to overcome exhaustion, his personal effort had failed. But it now became his task to rally and support the other attacking crews.Hopgood was next in M-Mother but his attack went disastrously awry. Cannon shells thrashed the aircraft and it erupted into flames.The dropped bomb sprang over the top of the dam as the burning Lancaster struggled to gain height and hurtled 200ft downwards, to explode on the power station below.Hopgood somehow cleared the forested ridge behind the dam but then ordered his crew: \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake, get out of here!\u0027In those terrible seconds aboard the blazing M-Mother, three were able to escape before it ploughed into the ground and dissolved into flames, killing the four men still aboard.\u0027Poor old Hoppy,\u0027 said an unidentified voice among the crews still circling the target, stunned by the horror of the spectacle they had witnessed.It was now Mickey Martin\u0027s turn in P-Popsie. \u0027Come in number three, you can go in now,\u0027 called Gibson, who had decided to fly alongside P-Popsie as he approached, to ert German fire.He would invite his own destruction, the fate that had just befallen John Hopgood and his men, to improve another crew\u0027s chance of success.Gibson had been an exhausted man even before he took off. Only iron strength of will could be keeping him airborne.The ruse didn\u0027t work. As the two Lancasters roared up the lake, P-Popsie was hit in the starboard wing, jolting the aircraft just as its bomb fell away, bounced across the water and exploded a critical 50 yards off the central aiming point.As Martin banked away, his rear-gunner saw a gigantic waterspout as the bomb exploded — and left the dam standing. The three outstanding fliers of 617 Squadron had now failed in attempts to breach the Möhne.From the pack circling overhead, Melvin Young — nicknamed \u0027Dinghy\u0027 because he\u0027d twice been shot down over the sea and survived —in A-Apple was called in next.P-Popsie took station on his port wing, matching his approach as A-Apple flew in low, low, lower, up the lake. Then their load was gone, skipping over the water while the two bombers banked and climbed steeply away.The bomb bounced three times, struck the dam wall and vanished. The positioning was perfect.Three seconds later, 6,600lb of Torpex exploded, inflicting upon the Möhne a pulverising earthquake shock.As a new column of water soared upwards, Young cried exultantly over the VHF: \u0027I think I\u0027ve done it!\u0027 Yet as the lake calmed, still the wall appeared unbroken.So at 0049, it was the turn of J-Johnny, piloted by David Maltby, who had celebrated his 23rd birthday a week earlier and had a wife back in Lincolnshire expecting a baby any day.He made a perfect run, dropped his bomb and even as his aircraft crossed the dam wall, he saw its crown already crumbling.Water soared into the sky, this time accompanied by mud and fragments of masonry, then gently fell back to reveal a colossal breach opening in the midst of the dam. Gibson banked towards the wall and saw the lake surface looking \u0027like stirred porridge . . . gushing out and rolling into the Ruhr Valley towards the industrial centres of Germany\u0027s Third Reich\u0027.There was a thrilled yell over the VHF: \u0027It\u0027s gone! It\u0027s gone!\u0027 The desperation that had overtaken the fliers, the sense of humiliating failure, was replaced by exhilaration, wonder, relief, triumph.In every watching cockpit there were cheers and roars across the intercoms as these very young men succumbed to a schoolboy joy. \u0027I can hardly describe the atmosphere in the plane,\u0027 said Maltby. \u0027The yelling, the pure excitement.\u0027There has since been debate about whose bomb breached the dam. It seems almost certain that Young\u0027s had achieved a decisive fracture, which became apparent even as Maltby\u0027s exploded.Now Gibson watched the tidal wave sweeping down the valley, the clouds of spray that became a fog, the irresistible weight of water racing through the breach in the dam.\u0027Down in the foggy valley we saw cars speeding along the roads in front of the great wave of water which was chasing them and going faster than they could ever hope to. \u0027I saw their headlights burning and . . . water overtake them, then the colour of the headlights underneath the water changing from light blue to green, from green to dark purple, until there was no longer anything except the water, bouncing down in great waves.\u0027The codeword indicating success was received at operations HQ back in England at 0056. There, Barnes Wallis had been burying his head in his hands at the earlier news of casualties and of failure.The young men, the fliers, were doing their parts with wondrous courage. The old ones, like him, who had sent them, appeared to have got it wretchedly, tragically wrong. And now despair was replaced by success. He jumped up, pumping his arms like a triumphant athlete. Every face in the operations room broke into beams of relief and congratulation.Back at the Möhne, Gibson ordered home those Lancasters whose bombs had gone, while he turned towards the Eder dam, 45 miles away, to mastermind the next phase of Operation Chastise.He stood off in G-George issuing instructions as, one by one, four Lancasters took a tilt at what was an even more terrifying objective than the Mohne. Surrounded by wooded hills, attacking it required a sudden dog-leg turn at the last minute, release of the bomb and then an instantaneous violent climbing turn, to gain height over the towering dam.The first dozen passes were unsuccessful, the Lancasters failing to drop their bombs or missing the target. One exploded in mid-flight and was lost. The last hope now rested on N-Nuts, piloted by Les Knight.On his second attempt, the bomb-aimer made a perfect drop at 240mph, 450 yards from the dam. The bomb bounced three times, hit the wall, sank and exploded. For a moment the dam remained intact but then, as one of the crew reported, \u0027as if some huge fist had been jabbed at the wall, a large, almost round black hole appeared and water gushed as if from a large hose.\u0027\u0027We could see the water gushing out,\u0027 said N-Nuts\u0027s navigator Sid Hobday, \u0027and all the masonry coming down. It really was fantastic, a sight I shall never forget.\u0027A similar attack on the third target, the Sorpe dam, was made by a sole Lancaster — all that remained of the five-plane third wave — but failed to breach it. A second plane later had a go but with the same result.However, the main aim of the mission had been achieved. Gibson called up his crews and told them: \u0027Good show, boys. Now let\u0027s all go home and get pie,\u0027 —though the last word may in truth have been more vulgar.And so they headed back to Scampton, the first arriving at 0319, the last at 0615, many of the Lancasters holed and limping. Eight out of the 19 did not return at all. Fifty-six of the 133 men who had set out on Operation Chastise were dead.Barnes Wallis lingered in the debriefing room, devastated by 617 Squadron\u0027s losses, a price for the fulfilment of his vision such as he had naïvely never contemplated.Those who made it, however, were ecstatic. \u0027Absolutely marvellous,\u0027 was the verdict of one pilot. \u0027Water, water everywhere — wonderful, wonderful. A terrific show.\u0027A few of the exhausted young men went to bed, but many partied for hours, with beer and whisky freely available in the officers\u0027 mess. Some Waafs were dragged from their beds to join a conga. Around the piano, remembered one airman, \u0027stubble-chinned, bleary-eyed aircrew types croaked out dirty songs about the Germans\u0027 before collapsing into unconsciousness.Their spirits revived after sleep and the grant of seven days\u0027 leave. They were young, and thrilled by the blaze of publicity and indeed adulation that descended upon them. \u0027We were treated like bloody gods,\u0027 said wireless operator George Chalmers in wonder.BUT what Gibson and his men had achieved would come to trouble the \u0027WingCo\u0027. In his memoirs, he wrote: \u0027We destroyed a legitimate industrial objective so as to hinder the Ruhr Valley output of war munitions.\u0027The fact that people were in the way was incidental.\u0027The fact that they might drown had not occurred to us. Nobody likes mass slaughter, and we did not like being the authors of it.

At times, he did so while living in a van. Now, his intimate imagery, mostly unseen, is finally receiving the attention it deserves in a new exhibition at the Bronx Museum of the Arts in New York.In The Life and Times of Alvin Baltrop, which opened last week, over 200 photos from his overlooked archive shed light on the city’s gay culture of the 70s.“Alvin photographed the LGBTQ community differently than Robert Mapplethorpe, who shot them in a very explicit and glamorization of the S\u0026ampM culture,” said Bronx Museum curator, Sergio Bessa. “Baltrop wasn’t about that. He saw sexual freedom.”Baltrop photographed the westside piers of Manhattan, today where the multi-million-dollar Whitney Museum resides. When a nearby highway collapsed in 1973, it took the city roughly a decade to fix it. “There was no money to fix anything, the highway stayed like that for ten years,” said Bessa. “It’s a different reality of what that area looked like in the 1970s and 1980s, compared to now.”His pictures show the time following the Stonewall riots and before the Aids crisis. Pier 48 was an abandoned wooden structure where gay men sunbathed, cruised and hooked up outside of the glittery world of disco and Studio 54.“He documented a place where people could go to hook up and have sex in a public space,” said Bessa. “People say ‘that happened all the time,’ but not the extent as it did in the 1970s. In the wake of counterculture, the end of hippie culture, social norms were changing, and this was happening at a global scale.”Baltrop, an African American photographer, was born in the Bronx in 1948. His mother was a Jehovah’s Witness who despised his photos and threw out his artwork when he was a teenager, which led him to moving away from home. He served in the Navy during the Vietnam War in the 1960s, where he took some of his early portraits of sailors. He was just 21. “He took them with the eye of a gay or bisexual man acting out on his desires,” said Bessa.He returned to New York to study art from 1973 to 1975, which led him to documenting the gay community in the West Village and along the piers from 1975 to 1986. However, it wasn’t just a study of architecture.His work, on view until next February, has been compared to photos by Robert Mapplethorpe, Peter Hujar, and Gordon Matta-Clark, who made artwork at the very same set of piers. They also take a snapshot of a city in ruin, and a queer community struggling for inclusion. Through the 1970s and 1980s, Baltrop shot nude men sunbathing along the Hudson River and a stunning portrait of activist Marsha P. Johnson.But Baltrop struggled to make a living and among his odd jobs, he worked as a jewelry designer, a street vendor and a cab driver. “He was a very poor man, he sustained himself driving a van, was a street vendor, he had a difficult life and photography was a passion, a labor of love. The photos are what they are.”He only had a few exhibitions in his life, one at a gay nightclub. Baltrop, however, gained critical acclaim after Artforum critic Douglas Crimp wrote about his work in 2008. “I don’t think Baltrop saw photography as a career, let’s say he saw it as a passion,” said Bessa. “He had a sophisticated eye for black and white photography and most of the photos here are vintage prints he developed himself.”The photos were not always taken care of in an archival manner. They were spread across his home in piles – some spilling onto the floor. “When people would come over to his home,” adds Bessa, “Baltrop would tell them to ‘catwalk through the photographs’. This isn’t something a professional photographer would say.”His images ranged from men having sex (shot from a distance) to homeless friends who lived onsite. He also photographed random New Yorkers on their daily strolls, the graffiti and the police surrounding crime scenes.Though people were scarcely documented on the site, they sometimes had an air of loneliness to them. “Sometimes he’d photograph a solitary man holding a bag, or people looking for each other,” said Bessa. “He didn’t pry on people. They’re often shot from far away, which makes the photo more interesting.”There are also a lot of architectural photos, too. Pier 52, where he took many of these photos, was demolished in 1983. “His photos outlived the structure,” said Bessa. “There’s a thorough documentation of the site, which is fascinating.”He fell in such deep love with photographing the piers that Baltrop sold his cab and bought a moving van, which allowed him to work less. “In his off time, he took photos at the piers,” said Bessa. “He had a lot of trouble to pay his rent, he was a bouncer at a gay club in the East Village, he really struggled to survive.”It wasn’t frowned upon having a side hustle, however. “We now live in a time of affluence and things, but in the 1970s, the city was falling apart,” said Bessa. “People did whatever they needed to do to survive.”The loneliness in the photos translates into a stark minimalism in the photos, which symbolize the simplicity of New York back then. “The 1960s and 1970s were tough and brutal,” said Bessa. “He cared for homeless men in the piers who were kicked out of their homes. He got young men to test for STDs and gave them relationship advice. He had this caring side of him.”Similar to Johnson, a force behind the Stonewall Uprising of 1969 who recently had a monument raised in her honor, it has taken 40 years for Baltrop’s work to be recognized, which is long overdue. But this could very well be the beginning.“This is an archival exhibition,” said Bessa. “Hopefully someone will do a bigger show with better prints in the future. They tie into the history of New York and queer culture, but his work was much bigger than just that, this is only a small fraction of his photos.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f54fb52f012525bd30a0e01f978f0368ab24861/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7caf55f85620fb70a96a4078cef9ba7b 960w","title":"brexit wont influence our friendship twinned towns","story":"From butchers to doctors to teachers, people in paired towns across Europe discuss daily life – and facing the big splitMy dad was a butcher in Faisalabad, Pakistan. He came to this country in 1959 and had his own butcher’s shop in Manchester. I was his apprentice. There were three of us – my older brother, me and my younger brother.I opened my business on 1 November 2001. My father was very proud parents like their children to follow in their footsteps. My dad had tremendous ability – I won’t bring myself to say I’m on the same level, but maybe I’m halfway there.It’s a family business now. My wife serves the customers, and my son has a takeaway next door I supply the meat to them. We work as a team. It’s a hard working life. I start at 7am preparing the meat for the counter, and we’re open 9am-9pm, seven days a week. I’m 51 and I’m still working away, but I’m making a living and I’m happy. When I retire, if I have the stamina, I’ll still do a few hours a day. I’ve always worked – I’m a working-class person.I love Manchester. I was born and bred here, and I would never go anywhere else. The Jilani name has been around for a long time – the mosques know us, the whole community knows us, and generations of people still come to buy halal meat from us.Manchester has always been a base for Asian people, from India and Pakistan. I don’t feel European at all I feel British, English. I’ve been to other countries in Europe, but England’s 10 times better.David Cameron made the wrong decision. I think it would have been better to stay in the EU for business reasons. I’m a small businessman – we’re all out to make a living. Whatever happens with Brexit, I hope the change is for the better.Benny Gränitz, 37, butcher in Chemnitz, GermanyMany people don’t want to pay extra for good-quality meat. But I am optimistic that is changing – it seems that fewer people are buying cut-price supermarket sausages. I like my job. We can influence the whole chain, from the farmer to the customer who eats our sausages.For me, being European has its advantages. It’s practical to be able to cross borders without issues. On the downside, there are lots of European rules and regulations that make my life difficult. Maybe we’d have to comply with similar rules even without the EU, but they are definitely a big factor, and they have forced some local butchers to close. We’ve had to invest a lot to meet their strict standards.I don’t foresee any big shift for our business after Brexit. A lot will depend on how Britain fares outside the EU. If things go well, maybe other countries will want to follow suit. If things go badly, I’m sure people will feel happy to stay.Twinning is a nice idea, but I didn’t know we were partnered with Manchester. The two cities are well suited they are both industrial places. We also have a Düsseldorf square in Chemnitz, named after our partner city in the former West Germany.Life in Chemnitz is quiet and pleasant. There’s not much going on. Sometimes it’s as if the streets have been emptied of people. Other places are livelier but I can’t imagine living anywhere else.Interview by Jess SmeePunam Krishan, 35, is a GP who lives in Glasgow with her husband and five-year-old sonI’m one of the very few GPs who still loves being a GP. People see us when they’re at a crossroads – with their health, wellbeing or personal situations. You get to be part of their big moments as well as their not-so-big moments.As a partner, I experienced stress and burnout. You work 12-hour days as a GP and then have to manage the business side, as well as juggling family life.It was encroaching on all my relationships, and I felt quite unhappy. I remember being on holiday in Turkey, ordering toilet roll for the health centre for my practice. I left my partnership in September 2017 and I’ve been a locum ever since.Although my heritage is Indian (my mum and dad are from Punjab) I was born and brought up in Glasgow. I’m very much part of two cultures. My mum used to take us to India every summer, and by week four I’d think: “I just want to go home.”I love being Glaswegian it’s such a multicultural, erse city. I didn’t appreciate it until I moved to London for a few years. In London you have pockets with, for example, a large Indian population or a Caribbean community. In Glasgow, the communities are a lot more integrated.Scotland didn’t want to leave the EU, so there is this sense of feeling hard done by, and the fact my son hasn’t had a choice in this saddens me. I want to keep him connected I’ll probably take him on more holidays to Europe after Brexit.I worry about what’s going to happen to my European friends and colleagues. If they leave, how will that affect our NHS, and our wider healthcare system? A lot of our machines and drugs come from Europe. If we don’t have a deal, how are we going to access these things?Although the idea of twinning towns predates the second world war, it was in its aftermath that the concept took hold as a way of promoting reconciliation and friendship between nations. Coventry, which suffered heavy bombing, was a pioneer. In 1942, women from the city sent a message of hope to the women of Stalingrad (now Volgograd), which had also been devastated. Two years later, the two cities agreed an official “bond of friendship”. Links with Kiel (1947) and Dresden (1956) followed.In the early 1970s, as the UK prepared to join the European Economic Community, the government offered funding to encourage twinning. “The idea was that new forms of trade would be more successful if British people were culturally competent in dealing with Europeans,” says Nick Clarke, associate professor of human geography at the University of Southampton. School exchanges and foreign language learning flourished.The 21st century, however, has seen some partnerships falter, with a number of UK towns “un-twinning” from their European counterparts. When Peter Davies became mayor of Doncaster in 2009 he scrapped its five town-twinning arrangements, as part of a series of cash-saving measures. “Only about a dozen people ever benefited from these trips,” he said. “I can see that it arose out of altruistic motives after the war, but it just became about junkets.” In 2011 the Tory-run town council in Bishop’s Stortford ended ties with Friedberg and Villiers-sur-Marne, after more than 46 years, blaming “lack of interest”. The Lib Dems argued it had more to do with Tory Euroscepticism.Antonio Barillà, 57, is a family doctor working in TurinI have been working as a family doctor in Turin and the wider Piedmont region for 26 years. Over the years the job has changed for the worse. There is a real lack of funding in the public sector. Bureaucracy slows us down. There are pharmaceutical and diagnostic rules that must be followed treatment protocols that are still printed on paper. If a worker takes a sick day, they still have to present their employer with a written affidavit from their family doctor. It is this sort of bureaucratic strain that causes burnout, and motivates Italian doctors to abandon the public sector.I don’t feel Turin is an important part of my identity. I was born in Reggio Calabria, in southern Italy, and came here for work. Hundreds of thousands of Italians moved from the south to Turin after the second world war. They left their cities and families to work here. Turin is a multicultural city, where Italian and foreign migrants coexist. You overcome these differences by seeking out what unites rather than ides us. My wife is Piedmontese, and we have two children. I am perfectly integrated culturally, socially and in my work.I am proudly Italian – we are a free, extraordinarily complex and unpredictable people. But I no longer recognise myself in the Europe of today, where nationalism is raging. The populism taking root in Italy is the expression of the failure of the political establishment over the past 25 years. Populist leaders are being asked to solve problems like insecurity and the decaying social fabric. People believe that European politicians have not regulated finance they have been at its service.Brexit is simply another way to ide us, and I don’t think it will bring benefits to the UK. I believe it will eventually be overturned by the people who oppose it.Interview by Lorenzo TondoBob Holderness, 48, is headteacher at The Parkside School, Norwich, a complex-needs schoolParkside is an urban school that takes pupils from the whole of Norfolk. All the specialist schools in Norfolk are heavily oversubscribed. We all face sustained pressure to admit more pupils to sites designed for far fewer pupils and staff. In the city centre we have the White Lion Cafe, where our pupils learn communication and interaction skills. It won a national award but we’ve had to make the decision to close it, as a direct result of our budget situation.I have been in education for 25 years. I have seen so many colleagues leave the profession, citing stress and burnout. It’s difficult to recruit people where we are geographically, flanked by the North Sea. However, at Parkside we have staff who have worked in the school for many years, including myself.Although I have lived in a number of other places, Norwich has always been my home. I was born in Sheffield – my dad was a history lecturer at Sheffield University he did some work on our family tree and we established that my mum’s family moved from Suffolk to Norwich in 1602. I feel a sense of belonging here.The original idea to twin communities after the second world war was to reduce the risk of future world conflict and promote cultural and economic links. Both of these ideas are still valid. The link between Norwich and Novi Sad in Serbia supported many joint education ventures. I recently got in contact with a former teacher who taught at Parkside in 1985, when the twinning first happened. A team went over, and they sent resources to a complex-needs school over there. When I arrived in 2002, that link had gone cold.From a historical and political perspective, I consider myself European. I have grave concerns over the ision of the country with Brexit. We need to work together to achieve a compromise.Violeta Strahinjevic, 47, is director of Milan Petrović School for children and young people with disabilities and special educational needs, in Novi Sad, SerbiaI became director of the school last year, but I’ve been working here for 22 years as a specialist teacher. One of the daily challenges we face is how to increase the acceptance of people with disabilities within the community. We try hard to include our children in local activities – the film festival, exhibitions, music festivals. It is essential for their social inclusion.We often collaborate with art students or professional artists – for our project Crossover they performed a stage musical in the city and surrounding villages. It is one of the many little steps we take to try to change attitudes. There is a long way to go, but I feel that in Novi Sad we are moving in the right direction.I feel equally a citizen of Novi Sad and a citizen of Europe. I think Britain should stay in the EU. It’s much more beneficial, not just for British people but for all of us, if Britain remains a member. But whatever happens, I am sure it won’t influence our friendship.Lisa Gunn, 44, is an artist who works in Coventry, and is involved in the CoventryDresden Arts ExchangeI was born in Walsgrave hospital in Coventry, and I grew up just outside the city. My father and his father were born here. Coventry is in our blood.I was in a road accident in April 1997, and the seatbelt broke my spine. I couldn’t do anything for four years I was in agonising pain. I was doing my art degree at Coventry University and my tutors were really supportive.My recent work is strongly connected with the ruins of Coventry cathedral and what they symbolise. It was devastated in the war – it’s like a skeleton – and I feel a metaphorical connection. We are both physically damaged, but we are still standing.I’ve only just become involved with the CoventryDresden Arts Exchange. I travelled to Dresden in February and took part in an exhibition called Condition Humaine, involving two artists from Coventry (including myself) and two from Dresden. It was organised around the anniversary of the bombing of Dresden in the second world war. We’ve all come from cities that rose from the ashes to create something new, and the work we’ve exhibited is inspired by that. The same show came to Coventry cathedral this summer.The Dresden trip was fantastic. My father came with me. Since I’ve been involved in this project, I’ve found out a lot about his early life. He was born under the living-room table in a Morrison shelter in an air raid on Coventry during the war.Everyone I met in Dresden was lovely – the artists and everyone connected with them. I made some great new friends. I invited them to come and stay with me.The economic impact of Brexit will definitely affect my work. Since the 2008 recession, people have become more careful about how they spend their money, and art is a luxury. I do sell work, but not as much as I used to.Kerstin Franke-Gneuss, 60, is an artist who lives and works in Dresden, and is involved in the CoventryDresden Arts ExchangeI have worked as a freelance artist in Dresden since 1984. I have a studio in the Künstlerhaus, the Artists’ House, which was built 120 years ago and is custom-designed for artists to live and work in. I make prints, and create big installations in public spaces. I can only make my art here in Dresden it is inspiring for me.The theme of this year’s exhibition of the CoventryDresden Arts Exchange is human existence in war and suffering, in reconciliation and peace. Twinning brings us closer to the “common European home” envisaged by Mikhail Gorbachev. This grand idea is being lost. Why would people want to have new borders? I come from the former GDR, and I know how small the world can be.With Brexit, there will be difficulties to overcome: new border controls, papers to fill in for customs clearance – a lot more hassle. This makes the connection and friendship between Coventry and Dresden all the more valuable.Milo Smith, 36, is general manager of Ninety-Nine Bar and Kitchen in AberdeenI’ve been general manager of an eclectic wee cocktail bar for five years, and I love it. Previously, I was an art teacher at a secondary school, but there was a lot of politics and paperwork, unnecessary stress, and too many hours. Believe it or not, when I became a bar manager I started working a lot less. I’ve worked in bars since I was 15, so it made sense to come back.The main challenge is the business rates, and how expensive everything’s getting. Taxes, and the cost of everything from sugar to alcohol to plastic, have gone up. The minimum wage is going up. The more you work to generate a profit, the harder it becomes.I think Brexit is a total farce. I’m someone who will roll my sleeves up and get on with whatever needs doing, but in this case we don’t know what to get on with. Most of the drinks we stock in our bar come from Europe. Our drinks suppliers import them, so any cost implications of crossing borders after Brexit will affect us.I was born in Aberdeen and I’ve lived here, on and off, for the better part of 35 years. I feel a strong identity with the city. It’s quite a close-knit community. Aberdonians are pretty stubborn, and we also like to have a good time. We’re the sort of people who will have a barbecue even if it starts to rain – we’ll just get the brollies out. We make the most of a bad situation.The last time I was in Stavanger was four years ago, for a friend’s stag do – he lives there. Both Aberdeen and Stavanger are oil and gas cities, and you can tell that as soon as you arrive. It has a similar feel, the same company names, the industrial-style buildings, trucks transporting goods.Kristine Ekeland, 26, and Steffen Rege, 28, are co-owners of Hygge bar in StavangerKristine I’ve been running the bar with my co-owner Steffen since March 2017. I imagine it’s a demanding job in any part of the world, but here you have different challenges: Stavanger is a small city – there are about 120,000 people living here. There is quite a good nightlife, but you’re fighting over the same customers.We designed the bar to create something unique. We have a gigantic wall of plants and a beer pong area. We’ve just renovated using wood from an old fishing boat. We get some tourists, but it’s mainly locals. We also get quite a few international students.Stavanger is home but my mum is from Brazil, so I can relate to both cultures. Steffen was born and raised in Stavanger. It’s only a small place, but there’s an aura here that always reels people back.Steffen The two cities have got oil in common – platforms in the North Sea. A plane goes to Aberdeen every day.I used to work for Halliburton in Aberdeen, and I thought the city was great, all the redbrick houses. The price of beer was a bit cheaper, but not much, and the food is different – a bit more greasy.I feel European. I’ve been to many places but I’ve never travelled outside of Europe. In terms of Brexit, there will be good or bad things whatever Britain does. It’s better to be able to do things yourself, than to be told what to do.Dr Steve Wharton, 56, is a senior lecturer in French and communication, and departmental Erasmus and assistantships director at the University of BathBeing an academic is one of the best jobs in the world. It gives you the chance to engage with young people, to help them to develop, and you get to do it alongside some pretty good colleagues.We do not live in an ivory tower, though. We face the same problems of pay, pensions and insecurity as any other profession. There was a national strike last year over changes to the pension scheme. I was on strike for 14 days.I’ve worked at the university and lived in Bath for half my life – I’m 56 now. I met my husband through the university. He now lives and works in Parma in Italy, so we travel backwards and forwards quite a lot. Brexit could affect that.I’m originally from Dorset, and I felt at home within about six months of moving here. Bath is a friendly place. If I’m at the bus stop I’ll talk to people and they won’t look sideways and move away, they will join in the conversation. There’s a remarkably international presence within the city, and that’s not just the students. It’s home to people from France, Spain, Italy, Germany… Being European is very much part of my identity – I’m a European Brit.When I was 21, I taught English at a school in Normandy for nine months. In the 90s, I taught at the Université Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris, and I lived there when I was doing my PhD.The decision to leave the EU is a mistake the ridiculous mantra of taking back control of things we controlled already skewed the debate. I have colleagues who have broken down in tears because the website for registering an interest in remaining in the UK wasn’t working. As a UK citizen, I felt ashamed.The University of Bath has been proactive in contacting all of its international partners and saying it wants to continue working together. There is apparently a government promise to underwrite some kind of exchange programme. But quite what that will be is something none of us knows.Dr Mauve Carbonell, 40, is associate professor in history and director of the master’s programme in European and International Studies at Aix-Marseille University.Life as an academic in Aix is thrilling – and busy. In reality, I have two jobs: professor and researcher. I manage about 20 international cooperation agreements to encourage student and staff exchanges. The partnership with Bath is long-established and one of the most important and successful we have had.Every year we send six of our students to Bath and we welcome about six students from Bath on our master’s programme. Our students have an obligatory mobility period of six months in the spring semester and a lot of them decide to go to Bath. Erasmus agreements allow them to study abroad without paying additional fees to the host university to benefit from a grant, and to have their overseas study programme formally recognised.Aix-en-Provence is the city where I grew up as a teenager, where I studied 20 years ago and where I now work, after spending time elsewhere in France and Europe. It’s a part of my identity, but it has become a smaller part as my European identity has become stronger. First I got an Erasmus grant to attend the Humboldt University in Berlin. Then, for my PhD on European integration history, I travelled to European archive centres and met people involved in the birth of the European Community. I lived a truly European experience as a young researcher. I feel at home anywhere from Tallinn to Lisbon, from Galway to Athens.We fear Brexit will limit our students’ choices.

The Dutch city of Utrecht is unveiling an answer at its railway station on Monday morning: the world’s largest multistorey parking area for bicycles.The concrete-and-glass structure holds three floors of gleaming double-decker racks with space for 12,500 bikes, from cargo bikes that hold a family to public transport bikes for rent.It is part of a strategy in which hundreds of millions of euros are being devoted to enhancing cycling infrastructure across the Netherlands, a nation so fervent about its two-wheelers that it is applying to add cycling to its inventory of intangible heritage.“We are striving to make it a cyclists’ paradise and there’s still much to be done,” said Stientje van Veldhoven, a junior infrastructure minister. “I’d like us to make better use of what I call this secret weapon against congestion, poor air quality in cities and climate change that is also good for your health and your wallet.”She added: “If you want to get people out of their cars and into public transport, you need to make sure using public transport is easy and comfortable. It needs to be very easy to park your bike as close to the train as possible – and you don’t want to be looking for half an hour for a space.”Demand for public transport is growing, the main four cities are predicted to expand, and the Netherlands has been struggling to meet its climate crisis commitments, so encouraging more bike use is a political priority.“In the next 10 years, 500,000 more people will come to urbanised areas, and if all of those people bring their car then we are going to have massive congestion,” said Van Veldhoven. “So investment in public transport, cycling lanes and cycle parking facilities is crucial to keep this area that’s essential for our national economy moving.”Utrecht is promoting cycling as part of a “healthy urban living” policy. “We are counting on biking as a healthy and sustainable form of transport for a growing city,” said the deputy mayor, Victor Everhardt. “Cycling is in the genes of people from Utrecht and in 1885 it built the Netherlands’ first bike lane. Every day, 125,000 cyclists go through the city centre to work, school and the station, and the world’s largest bike park sits perfectly in this global cycling city.”The scale of Dutch investments shows cycling is about more than just the issue of transportation, according to BYCS, a social enterprise behind a network of international cycle mayors. “The bike park in Utrecht shows you need massive investments into cycling infrastructure parking, cycle lanes and great architecture, but we believe this is one of the most impactful things a city can do,” said its strategy director, Adam Stones. “If you look at it as transformation – how it addresses mental and physical health, brings communities together and addresses resource use and the environment – you put more weight behind it.”But some experts sound a note of caution. Although the Fietsersbond, a Dutch cycling organisation, warmly welcomes the investment, it warns that it is irritating and counterproductive when bike parks are combined with a no-tolerance policy to on-street parking – as in central Amsterdam, where “wild” parked bikes are confiscated.“I am not a fan of this,” said its director, Saskia Kluit. “There’s a grey area growing where the government wants a clean appearance and wants to get rid of the bikes, but parked bikes give the street liveliness and movement, and if you want the benefit of the cyclist shopping, it’s better they can stop everywhere they want.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ce1d9b47524deca7968d3c90d87105ae4e21219/79_0_2342_1405/master/2342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87343411b8c621b70fe648e39963af83","title":"crunch point oceans treaty","story":"There are whales alive in the Arctic today that were born before Moby-Dick was published in 1851. Despite this extraordinary fact, humans kill about 300,000 whales, dolphins and porpoises every year – most die indiscriminately when they get caught up in fishing gear.Our oceans and the life they sustain are under mounting pressure from multiple threats, including overfishing, climate breakdown, oil drilling and plastic pollution. Quite simply, they are in crisis.As a passionate advocate for marine conservation, last year I was one of almost three million people who backed Greenpeace’s Protect the Antarctic campaign, calling for the creation of a 1.8m sq km (695,000 sq mile) ocean sanctuary. The proposed sanctuary in the Weddell Sea would have been the largest protected area on Earth, offering a safe haven for penguins, seals, whales and other marine life. It would have made these pristine waters off-limits to oil exploration and the fishing industry.Sadly, this historic opportunity was lost when members of the Antarctic Ocean commission from China, Norway and Russia derailed the process and blocked the proposal.What we do know is that life on Earth depends on healthy oceans. Our fate and the fate of our seas are intimately and inextricably connected. Ocean sanctuaries would provide protection for wildlife populations and ecosystems, allowing them to recover and thrive. The wider benefits would be felt in other ocean areas that would continue to provide food security and livelihoods for millions of people. Healthy oceans also play a crucial role in slowing climate breakdown. The myriad creatures and plants in our seas capture and store carbon from the atmosphere, locking it away underwater. Damaged and depleted oceans will only worsen the climate emergency we are facing.Governments must seize this opportunity and write a new chapter for ocean governance that places conservation and sustainability at its centre. Now is the time to match ambition with action, to set aside geopolitical differences and commercial gain and act in the interests of future generations. We have a historic opportunity to strengthen ocean protection for decades to come. What happens in New York this month will have profound consequences for the future of humanity. This is a defining moment for the UK government to step up and show global leadership. Millions of us are watching, and hopefully it will do just that.• Gillian Anderson is an actor and activist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e7973d174b688b95e1e7ddacb97b63143a65b40/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a1d1fcdc83bcde8b150ab58a6a4a3ca","title":"jeremy corbyn nation saviour speech labour no deal","story":"Today’s speech was the Labour leader’s chance to muster a coalition against no deal. But all he wants is a general electionHistory is offering Jeremy Corbyn the gift of his dreams, and he is rejecting it. He has said he will do everything necessary to save Britain from the bizarre self-harm of no-deal Brexit, personally crafted by Boris Johnson. He will not.Corbyn will not lay aside partisan rhetoric and muster the parliamentary coalition that alone might bar no deal in the coming weeks, nor will he give way to other potential and less abrasive leaders of such a coalition. Every word Corbyn utters makes it ever more impossible for Liberal Democrats, nationalists or dissident Tories to lend him support, however temporary. Corbyn does not want to stop Brexit. He just wants a general election.In today’s speech, the Labour leader should have presented himself as the voice of majoritarian sanity. He should have sought to muster the erse tribes of political Britain to an emergency, to expose Johnson’s no-dealers as a masochistic minority. He should be reaching out to all Johnson’s opponents, talking, cajoling, compromising, fashioning the lowest common denominator of consensus. Corbyn should be the magnetic attractor of the “will of parliament”. As such, he would deserve the nation’s thanks for saving it from the disruption, hardship and expense of no deal – and for honouring the “frictionless border” that the Brexiters promised. Instead, he is simply aping Johnson. He is defaulting to the occupational disease of British politics – that it is about fighting elections, not governing countries.The Labour leader should recognise that he is in large part responsible for this crisis, by refusing to support Theresa May’s sensible withdrawal agreement. He voted against it even when such a vote was certain to lead to precisely the no deal he now claims to oppose. His motive then was not the national interest but to bring down May. He succeeded.Time has moved on. May’s agreement is still on the table, enabling a British departure from the EU on 31 October – in accordance with the 2016 referendum – while keeping the UK within Europe’s common economic area pending a final settlement. Any issues in such a settlement would be settled in the transitional period. Under the deal, both sides would live to fight another day.Despite the current noise, the sticking point to the May plan remains the Irish backstop. It is at least conceivable that its open-endedness might be negotiable with the EU – that is time-limited. But any such concession from the EU is implausible unless backed not just by the Irish but by a stable body of support within the British parliament. That support would require a leader and, for the time being, disciplined followers.Neither Johnson nor Corbyn can offer such leadership. Johnson does not care. Corbyn merely wants Labour to win an election. To that end, his best hope is surely now to behave like the saviour of a nation in distress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c019c73ff01288932578ba9a6a7cd7f4c895daf0/188_225_4896_2937/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6758db9ef3af1a08d5a5dab31659f7a","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of appetite","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘appetite’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘appetite’.Share your photos of what appetite means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 21 August at 10am.

She talks about saying the unsayable, escaping her gangster in-laws and taking on Donald Trump and Boris JohnsonJaney Godley prods her chin lovingly, as she talks about ageing. “I love putting up pictures on Twitter of me with no makeup. See every wrinkle,” says the Glaswegian comedian, who is 58. For a glancing moment, she sounds a little awestruck. “I survived rape, I survived my Ma being murdered, this is my face. If it offends you, don’t look at it. I think other people should have that attitude.”Godley is sitting in the kitchen of the elegant Edinburgh tenement flat she has rented for the duration of the fringe with her daughter Ashley Storrie, a successful comic too, of whom her mum is glowingly proud. It is a biblically rainy day, and Godley has erected a shoe-changing station of plastic bags and a small stool at the front door, anxious to keep the carpets clean.With years of five-star reviews and sold-out gigs behind her, recent months have brought her a huge new audience as a result of the political voiceovers she posts online. Within hours of Boris Johnson visiting Nicola Sturgeon at her official residence last month, for instance, Godley had posted a video that articulated the first minister’s imagined interior monologue in an irritable Glaswegian accent. The prime minister had extended his arm to escort Sturgeon into her own home – in what many saw as a gesture of male entitlement – and Godley as Sturgeon is blunt: “Put your arm down, ya arsehole, get in.” The clip lasts for only a few seconds, and has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.This month, Godley has brought the format to the Edinburgh fringe, where her shows are packed out in advance of a UK-wide tour. “I can’t believe that people like them so much,” she says. “But then we don’t have many satirical shows, and the ones we do have are like Have I Got News for You. I was the first working-class Scottish female comic ever to do it.” She pauses. “Last year. So even when we have satire, it’s not relatable to everybody.”Godley has strong opinions about Johnson and Trump. She came to the pro-independence cause during the 2014 referendum campaign, and is pragmatic about the prospects of an independent Scotland: “I don’t think its going to be a utopia, I think we’re going to fuck up a lot of things, there will be mistakes. But what can be worse than Boris Johnson, who is a Poundland Donald Trump?”She believes that Johnson’s premiership and the “shambles” of Brexit is causing many of those who voted against independence in 2014 to reassess: “People are like: ‘This is tribal, this is the flag, this is the Queen, we love the union.’ Then they see their benefits affected, their taxes, that they can’t get insulin, and then people change their minds.”As Godley rattles through the details of her “dodgy background”, there are elements of slapstick, and she is not coy about a pitch-black punchline. When she tells me that the uncle who raped her as a child was found dead in his bed last year, she fixes me with an even gaze. “All the men that fuck me about die alone. Weird, eh?”She is unsentimental about experiences that must have been painful, brutal and frightening. But she is also scrupulously clear about where responsibility lies: it’s not her shame, she reiterates several times.The youngest of four, Godley was raised by an alcoholic father and a chaotic, debt-prone mother in the East End of Glasgow. She was systematically abused by an uncle throughout her childhood, left school without any qualifications and was married at 19 to the son of a local gangster. Her mother died in 1982, when Godley was 21, murdered, her daughter believes, by her violent boyfriend, who was never charged by the police despite her family’s protestations.“I had nits, scabies, we were poor,” she says bluntly of her childhood. “I remember eating out of bins and being a teenager with dirty clothes. But I was bright and I loved reading, so I had the chance to escape. And I’m not ashamed of it, because it wasn’t my fault.”That is one of the reasons she does the free fringe (her gigs have an honesty bucket at the exit). “I love the fact that people who are pure skint can come through from Glasgow and see a free show, because it’s a very elite business.”What is blazingly obvious, listening to her life story, is the way Godley has taken direct action, with great courage, often in the face of male power. Aged 12, she threatened her uncle with a red-hot poker: “He backed off because he’d never been confronted before.” As an adult, she took him to court, along with her sister, whom he had similarly abused, and secured a conviction. After years of bullying, she walked out on her gangster in-laws and forged a successful international career “doing something I’d never seen anyone like me doing”.Godley is never lost for words, but she pauses here for a millisecond when I ask her about this. “When Ashley meets members of my extended family, she’s like: ‘HOW?’ I don’t know what made me different and I know there is something different.”To describe Godley’s route to comedy as unusual is an understatement. Critics who describe her standup material – which embraces child abuse and murder – as “unique” do so for good reason. Godley spent her 20s running a pub in Calton, an area regularly cited as having the lowest life expectancy for men in the whole of the UK, with her husband. The pub belonged to George Storrie, a notorious criminal patriarch with seven sons, six of whom deeply resented Godley and her steadfast refusal to keep quiet.The young couple surprised even themselves in their ability to run a business well: “We were proper young grafters,” she says fondly. “We didn’t smoke or drink, we paid tax, put our daughter through a private school. I wanted her to get an education because I never got one.”But after her father-in-law’s death, the police raided his property – “they wouldn’t come when George was alive” – where Godley’s family and several other brothers were living. They found guns and weapons secreted about the place: Godley and her husband were put in prison for the night, but let out, “because we could prove the guns weren’t ours”.Then a dispute over the running of the family pub, combined with already toxic fraternal relations, pushed Godley and her husband to walk out of their home one night, with their daughter, the cat and some schoolbooks, never to return. While the brothers’ mutual chaos has continued across the decades, the couple have not had further contact with them for 27 years.The family moved into temporary accommodation. It was terrifying, she says: “We had no transferable skills.” But that wasn’t entirely true: as a barmaid in one of Glasgow’s roughest pubs, Godley had honed the comic timing and expert crowd control essential for a stand-up career. Having already excelled at open-mic nights, she progressed quickly on the comedy circuit.It was the mid-90s, she reminds me, when “alternative” comedy was very much the domain of “student boys in nice jeans and funny haircuts”. She rolls her eyes: “I saw a lot of cock back then.” At one show, a couple of male comedians came out naked, carrying a plank of wood, “and the promoters were like: ‘This is genius.’ And I was like: ‘This is NOT genius, I don’t understand any of this.’ And the audience weren’t laughing, they were bemused. I realised in that moment there were two types of comedy: comedians who people called ‘genius’, who only the promoters laughed at, and comedians the audience loved, and the promoters didn’t. I went on after them, did straight standup, and the audience laughed.“It was quite a shock to have a working-class, older woman – I was 35 and a mum – do this, and it got a few backs up.” But promoters were also suspicious because she was talking about subjects that people didn’t normally make jokes about.“I spoke about my Ma being murdered, child abuse, gangsters. Back then, even comics were saying: ‘You shouldn’t talk about that.’ But I’m so glad I did. The amount of people that came up to me and said: ‘I was abused and I’ve never laughed before.’ One of the most important things about comedy is nobody gets to tell you what you can joke about, as long as you’re punching up and not punching down.”The voiceovers aren’t her first brush with online fame. The day after the UK voted to leave the EU, the presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump flew in to visit his golf course at Turnberry, on the south-west coast of Scotland. Fuelled by righteous anger at the referendum result, and at Trump himself – “We’ve all met that man in the pub, that checks a woman out as he talks and then moves on if he’s not interested, then tells you that women’s issues don’t matter” – Godley hand-wrote a succinct protest slogan and headed for the coast. The photograph of a small but defiant woman, holding an A3 sign reading “Trump is a cunt”, surrounded by police, went viral.“I think half the world was shocked I used that word,” she says, “but there are worse words. Food bank is worse.” When Godley returned to Turnberry to protest against Trump’s visit as US president in 2018, she adapted the sign to read “Trump is a runt” with a strategically placed hand.She has depicted May trying to persuade Jeremy Corbyn to join a minoge (a Scottish savings club), and begging Sturgeon for her Netflix sign-in, before heading over for the summer to her Spanish caravan with Isa MacNamee and all the Sandras. Arlene Foster is not impressed: “Big Theresa’s pure steaming over in Torremolinos. She’s just joined the Snapchat group, Face-timed me at two in the morning singing Abba, as if I don’t have enough to do!”The references in the voiceovers – the savings club, Pippa Dee clothing parties, which auntie last borrowed the soup pot – are emphatically local to the west of Scotland, but Godley has a theory about why they travel so well: “These are really troubling times, and folk want to hark back to something with a sense of community. The soup pot is the very definition of that. People in America, Venezuela, Australia have all written to me and said it doesn’t matter what culture you belong to, whenever there’s a death, a birth, a homecoming, people get out the big soup pot. So that is a global icon of community.”She is bullish about requests to subtitle her broad Scots delivery: “I say, no, learn my accent. If you can learn to read Shakespeare and there’s a Burns club in every country, you can understand my accent.” Has she ever been confronted by one of her voiceover subjects? Politicians have written to her privately and asked “Can you do me?”, she twinkles, but refuses to disclose any further. Yes, she has been told that Sturgeon has seen them. “Apparently she finds them funny,” she says with the deliberate vagueness of someone who knows all too well that she does. But Godley insists they have never met, or spoken. “I wouldn’t want to be photographed with her because I’ve got such a dodgy background that I don’t want to infect her with it. I don’t want to be pals with any politician.”Godley has received death threats for her opposition to Trump, and so is well aware of the poison welling online. But the great thing about social media, she says, “is that people speak out. Before, if you stood in a pub and spoke about domestic violence, you’d be shut down in a minute.” For her mother’s generation, it was normal to see a woman walking down the road with two black eyes. “There’s laws that have changed. In Scotland, you can’t even gaslight a woman and rightly so – there’s refuges, places women can go.”There is a strong impression that Godley – who suffers fools gladly only to the extent that they provide her with another laugh line – has found her playground on Twitter. “Has Twitter changed my life? It has. I make a joke about it on stage: ‘My husband loves it because I used to argue with him …’ I treat it like daily life – if one person says you’re not funny, you don’t have to find me funny. My tour sells out.”For details of Janey Godley’s upcoming tour, go to janeygodley"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea09f0162570b711fd7fd7f9932af27eca81ca48/0_112_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40c6c280fe733af6152575454786b009","title":"tell us how have you reused your wedding dress","story":"We want to hear if you opted for a non-traditional dress, or if you’ve repurposed it so you could wear it againWorn for the big day, gone tomorrow – for many people a wedding dress will be the single most expensive item of clothing they ever buy.

Grease a one-litre loaf tin, line the bottom with greaseproof paper and add a handful of flour, tilting it on all sides so there is a light layer of flour all over the tin. Turn the tin upside down and lightly knock it against the counter to get rid of any excess flour.Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Crack the eggs into a blender, add the melted butter, milk, buttermilk and honey, and blitz until combined. Add the corn and half the thyme, then roughly blitz, leaving some chunks of corn intact.Sift the flour and baking powder into a medium-sized mixing bowl and whisk in the polenta and salt. Add the blended corn mix to the bowl and lightly whisk it into the sifted flour until just combined: overmixing at this stage will make for a heavy cornbread.

The deal will cost Bayern £7.8m plus wages, and the agreement also includes an option to buy, fixed at £109.8m.“FC Barcelona would like to publicly thank Philippe Coutinho for his commitment and dedication,” said an official statement, that also wished him “all the best in this new stage of his career.”Coutinho joined Barcelona from Liverpool in January 2018 but struggled to produce the form that he showed at Anfield. His future has been the subject of speculation throughout a summer in which Barcelona signed Antoine Griezmann, and Coutinho was not part of the matchday squad for their first league game of the season, a 1-0 loss to Athletic Bilbao. Coutinho has scored 21 goals in 75 games in all competitions for Barcelona, also contributing 11 assists.Speaking to Bayern’s official website, Coutinho said: “For me, this move means a new challenge in a new country with one of the best clubs in Europe. I’m very much looking forward to that. Like FC Bayern, I have big ambitions and I’m convinced that I can achieve them together with my new team-mates.”Bayern chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said: “We’ve been working on bringing in Philippe Coutinho for quite some time and we’re very happy that we’ve been able to complete this transfer. Our thanks go to FC Barcelona for agreeing to the transfer. With his creativity and outstanding skills, Philippe is a player who will immediately strengthen our attack.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b38527286de3cef8aa87bdb370b265bd2374e0f/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6f8eddc9971612dc49e055fdd5ce35","title":"premier league 10 talking points weekend action","story":"Ljungberg and Trossard make instant impact, Wilson has Liverpool quality and Rodgers leaves ‘young Frank’ on back footDuring Brighton’s first two seasons of Premier League football, their solidity came at the cost of invention. The players Chris Hughton hoped could provide a spark from the wing, Anthony Knockaert and José Izquierdo, never did on a consistent basis, the former now loaned to Fulham and the Colombian missing the start of the season after a knee operation. Graham Potter’s overhauling of the team’s style offers greater freedom and involvement for forward players. The signs from Leandro Trossard – the debutant playing off the left of an attacking trident against West Ham – were more than promising. Before his volleyed equaliser, executed sublimely, he had a goal chalked off when VAR ruled Dan Burn offside. Comparisons with his Belgian compatriot Eden Hazard have already been floated in East Sussex. John BrewinFrank Lampard is still seeking the right blend of solidity and creativity in his midfield and his first week of competitive action has exposed his options. Chelsea may have dazzled through the opening periods of the draw with Leicester but their best display arguably came in Istanbul when the 4-2-3-1 Lampard had hoped to implement was tweaked for something more akin to a 4-3-3 with Jorginho as its central anchor. N’Golo Kanté had operated to the right in a role similar to that inflicted on him by Maurizio Sarri, but still thrived. At times against Leicester, who were dominant after the interval, Chelsea yearned for proper control, with Jorginho and Kanté labouring after the exertions in midweek and Mateo Kovacic still lacking dynamism. Manchester United and Leicester have now found it too easy to exert a grip in central areas. Perhaps a three is the way to go, even with its implications for the Frenchman’s positioning. Dominic FifieldBrendan Rodgers frantically scribbled in his notebook at Stamford Bridge before half-time. There was plenty to discuss after a first 45 minutes in which his Leicester team failed to impose themselves. Chelsea under “young Frank”, as Rodgers referred to his opposite number in a pre-match radio interview, had started dangerously against both Manchester United and Liverpool only to struggle once the opposition adapted. Just as Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Jürgen Klopp threw Lampard’s Chelsea off their flow, so did a Rodgers switch. Heavy pressing and fast transitions might have stolen the match late on had James Maddison or Youri Tielemans finished less hastily. Leicester aim to be best of the rest and while also reasserting the new Chelsea’s teething problems, their revival was promising. John Brewin• Dominic Fifield: Lampard’s homecoming trikes a tone of anticlimaxWhen Gabriel Jesus headed in Manchester City’s second goal at Goodison Park on 6 February it was the fifth time Everton had conceded on home soil in five days. They have not let in another at Goodison since and only the Premier League champions have kept more clean sheets in 2019 than Marco Silva’s team. Saturday’s hard-fought win over Watford came with a sixth consecutive home clean sheet, Everton’s 10th in the last 13 games in total. After losing to City in February, Everton were beaten 1-0 at Watford, but have been unrecognisable since the 17-day break that followed defeat at Vicarage Road. Marco Silva credits the turnaround with an increased work ethic throughout the team, starting with relentless pressing from the front, but key iniduals have also improved as Saturday underlined. Jordan Pickford was calm and commanding when called upon while his central defenders, Michael Keane and Yerry Mina, excelled. Andy HunterJust how much trouble are Newcastle in? They were well beaten by a classy Norwich side who set about the Magpies just as they did so many Championship teams last year. Steve Bruce bemoaned his team’s lack of work off the ball and called them in for training on Sunday to stop it happening again. But there is a view that says his team could not actually have done much better. Their tactics were simply to contain the promoted side and rob the ball at moments of maximum vulnerability. This basic approach created two good opportunities at 0-0 only for first Emil Krafth then Joelinton to fluff their lines. At the same time the strategy hardly screamed of confidence in the players at Bruce’s disposal. Krafth and Joelinton have just arrived on Tyneside. The £40m forward, in particular, will have to improve if Newcastle are to keep clear of trouble. Paul MacInnesNewly promoted teams are invariably adrenaline high in August, often clocking up their best run of results during the weeks before the clocks go back and winter’s grim realities begin to bite. Over-hyping can be a danger but there should also be a recognition that Sheffield United’s Chris Wilder is not a manager to be patronised. Instead Wilder serves as a warning that assumptions are dangerous and appearances can be deceptive. True, he sounds and looks a little rough around the edges but in recent seasons he has arguably been the most innovative coach in England. Imagine the excitement if Pep Guardiola or Jürgen Klopp had been credited with inventing overlapping centre-halves. Wilder may not be smooth enough for some, may seem too parochial for others but snobbery should be suspended. Louise TaylorAnother game, another defeat for Southampton but all associated with the team should take encouragement from how they performed against Liverpool. The hosts more than matched their opponents during the first half and, while somewhat overwhelmed after the interval, they stayed in the contest and ultimately came within a firmer Danny Ings touch of snatching a draw. What generally impressed about Southampton’s display was their balance and organisation within a 3-5-2 formation. Everybody looked comfortable in their respective positions and there is a definite gameplan: stay compact, press at the right times and stretch the play whenever possible. In that regard Yan Valery looks as if he could be a particularly potent weapon for Ralph Hasenhüttl’s side. The 20-year-old was a consistently threatening presence on the right wing and it was from his excellent cross that Southampton could have, and should have, equalised.

Charlotte, 25, is a teaching assistant for children with special educational needs. Jack, 31, is a land agentThe first time Charlotte and Jack met – as her first shift at a clothes shop ended and his began – they talked for about 15 minutes and Charlotte went home with a giddy feeling. “I was like: ‘Mum, there’s this guy at work and he’s so cute and he seems really nice,’” she says. “I was thinking about him all week, because we were going to be on the same shift the following Saturday, and I was so excited. When I got there I said: ‘Hi, how’s it going?’ And he said: ‘I’m Jack, nice to meet you.’ I was so crushed.”Jack laughs. “I don’t remember us meeting. But that second time we met, I was very taken with Charlotte.” They chatted throughout their shift. “It was long hours,” he says. “We talked about everything from where we went to school to what type of food we liked. The manager pulled me to one side and said I needed to stop talking to Charlotte because I was distracting her from her work.” And did he? “No.”It was November 2011. Jack had finished university that summer and was working in the shop, and Charlotte, still at sixth form, had taken a Saturday job there for the Christmas period. After working that shift together, they exchanged numbers and agreed to go out on a date. “Then he added me on Facebook,” says Charlotte. “I took one look at your profile picture and I thought: ‘What have I agreed to go on a date with?’ Because it was so cringe – you had one leg cocked and your collar up, leaning against the door frame.” Jack laughs. “I obviously thought it was a good one.”They went out anyway, to the cinema, where they watched a terrible film. “It gave us lots to talk about,” says Jack. On their second date, they took a picnic to a local stately home and walked up to the folly (it would be the location where, five years later, Jack would propose to Charlotte). “I think we were official quite quickly,” says Charlotte.What did she like about him? “I thought he was quite cheeky. Jack is the sort of person who will go up to anyone and talk to them and instantly make them feel really comfortable. He’s just very cheerful.” Jack says: “She was very attractive but very down to earth, quirky, a bit of a bookworm.”Charlotte went to university in Liverpool after finishing school, and the relationship survived the distance and time apart between visits. “I came back from university …” says Charlotte. “I remember the date,” says Jack. Charlotte says: “I had a year when I lived with my mum and dad, and you lived with your mum and dad.”They got engaged in March 2016, and moved in together in August that year. “We never lived together until we bought a house together,” says Jack.Why does it work? “I think we balance each other out in a lot of things,” says Charlotte. “Our values are quite similar. However, our likes and personalities are quite different.” Whereas Jack is practical and methodical, Charlotte says she is “the complete opposite. I’m quite chaotic and maybe don’t think about things in the most straightforward way. Which is good, because sometimes you do something and I think: ‘I never would have thought of that, but it makes life so much easier.’ We both make each other think of things differently.” Jack says: “It’s good to be with someone who surprises you. Our approaches are quite different but I like to think we share a lot of goals.”They married in July 2017 and their son, Arthur, was born last year. They also have a dog and an allotment. “We knew that at some point the thing we would like was to live somewhere rural and have a family and quite a simple life,” says Charlotte, and they have made it happen.Want to share your story?

The options are limitless. But can they ever beat the camaraderie of working out with other people?Chessie King whoops, flipping her ponytail out of her face. Her partner, Mathew Lewis-Carter, grunts with the exertion, sweat pouring from his brow. Five cameras pick up every move, as they lunge and thrust in front of a pulsating LED screen at the east London studio where they are filming a high-intensity workout class for at-home fitness pioneers FIIT.The footage will be broadcast via the FIIT app as a live class. Users will be able to join from the comfort of their own homes. If they choose to wear the heart-rate monitor provided, they can compete with other users on a live leaderboard. There are also classes available on demand, for the less competitive.FIIT and the other players in the burgeoning “digital fitness” industry are all out for a piece of the UK’s £4.9bn fitness industry, which the market-research group Mintel predicts will grow to £5.3bn by 2023. Their aim? To bring the gym to you, in some cases with hi-tech wearables or equipment, or through guided workouts on your phone.Since FIIT launched in April 2018, the app has been downloaded by 150,000 users, who have taken a combined 500,000 classes like this one. “Let’s keep the sweat on the floor,” says the production head Mitra Memarzia from the darkened control room, as Lewis-Carter rocks back on his heels, exhaling deeply.Although the class is only half an hour long, it takes twice as long to record, meaning King and Lewis-Carter – fitness influencers and personal trainers with 633,000 Instagram followers between them – look knackered. But in order to get at-home users through the gruelling routine, the trainers have to project the positivity typically associated with children’s-TV presenters. “Maintain that energy even though you’re tired,” cheers King, legs pumping furiously. “We’re with you!”Later, at home, I try FIIT for myself. I log in via the app, put on the heart-rate monitor, connect the device to my TV, and move the coffee table into my kitchen – as in many urban homes, space is tight. On the screen, a timer counts down to the 8pm class, led by personal trainers Adrienne Herbert and Alex Crockford. It shows there are 14 other members online. Seeing them congregating in the “digital lobby”, I feel unaccountably nervous. But there’s no time for that: after a warm-up, we launch straight into a high-intensity class.It wasn’t so long ago that exercising at home was the norm. Jane Fonda defined the genre in the 80s, her tapes introducing women to the joys of aerobic fitness in footless tights. Cindy Crawford followed suit in the 90s, while Davina McCall entered the market more recently. But today’s hi-tech, interactive, at-home workouts are unrecognisable compared with those of the past.One SWEAT fan is Warwick-based Rebecca Allen, a 21-year-old professional dog-sitter. On the morning we speak, Allen has completed a half-hour workout dressed only in a sports bra and shorts – kit she would never have felt comfortable wearing at her former gym, where she witnessed men taking photos of women squatting without their knowledge. (Allen says she complained to the management, who did nothing.)“I feel a lot better for using this app than using the gym,” says Allen. “When I went to the gym, I didn’t have a routine, so I wasn’t sure what I was doing. But, with the app, you go up in stages, so you can feel a difference.” The app’s structured, goal-focused workouts help her stick with it when you complete a goal, confetti cascades down the screen. “Having goals and targets, and being rewarded for successfully achieving them, is a key component of building habits,” says SWEAT’s chief executive, Tobi Pearce.It is possible to exercise as effectively on your own at home as you would in a gym under supervision, depending on your own motivation – but there are risks. Most digital fitness programmes include warm-ups and cool-downs, but it’s possible to overdo it – and SWEAT’s focus on fat loss (users are encouraged to post photos documenting their progress towards “bikini body confidence”) may be triggering for people with eating disorders or obsessive exercise habits.“I was too regimented and hardcore about it,” says 27-year-old New Yorker Elizabeth Megrabyan, who works in advertising. Megrabyan bought the Kayla Itsines pdf (a forerunner to the SWEAT app) in 2016. She would amend the programme to cram in more high-intensity interval training (HIIT). “I was trying to achieve results faster. I think I became too obsessed with the programme – they show people’s progress pictures and I thought: ‘I want that.’” Megrabyan ended up in hospital with rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening illness sometimes caused by extreme muscle strain.The physiotherapist Adam Meakins advises people in general to avoid high-intensity workouts if they are new to exercise. “The risk with a novice going in and doing HIIT exercises is that you can end up pulling something in your muscular-skeletal system a lot more easily than you would if you were an experienced exerciser whose body has adapted resilience to explosive forces.” That said, he welcomes anything that will get people moving. “There are always risks associated with any exercise … the biggest risk factor is not doing any exercise at all.”Of course, gyms are more than just places we work out in – they are also important social hubs, particularly for self-employed people. I know this first-hand: as a freelance journalist, the only reliable interaction I have is with the trainers in my local gym, which I attend daily. Stripping that human contact out of my life would be alienating.Digital fitness apps try to combat this by encouraging users to form communities online: FIIT has a Facebook group, while SWEAT fans congregate on Instagram. When I speak to Allen, she is in the middle of a 30-day SWEAT challenge, in which users pledge to work out every day for a month and cheer each other on online. Allen says she has made friends through the SWEAT community. “You interact with other people, and they interact with you, and it’s so positive … it’s lovely. I don’t feel like I’m doing it alone.”FIIT’s interactive leaderboard approximates the experience of working out in a fitness class. “Other people working out with you gives you that accountability, and makes you work harder,” says its co-founder Sammi Adhami.Does the digital fitness industry want to run gyms out of business? SWEAT’s Pearce laughs awkwardly: “I wouldn’t necessarily say that’s our target.” But it may already be happening. Lauren Ryan of Mintel notes that Peloton’s North American “ridership” exceeded that of the boutique spin studio SoulCycle for the first time last year: “This indicates that digital fitness is already challenging gyms and fitness studios in other parts of the globe.”Still, it is a rare person who is driven enough to work out at home indefinitely, without a trainer shouting at them or classmates encouraging them on. (And there will always be people who require gym equipment.) “There’s a certain subset of the population who are going to be motivated enough to use this stuff at home,” says John Porcari, a professor of exercise and sport science at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. “But do I think it will replace gyms? No. I think the face to face interaction and camaraderie of working out in gyms is more powerful than working out at home.”Back in my living room, I crash about, mid-FIIT workout, as my boyfriend watches quizzically. “Get out of here!” I shriek, banishing him to our bedroom. Partway through a set of squat jumps, I silently apologise to my downstairs neighbours. Throwing myself to the floor for burpees, I am covered in crumbs. “I must vacuum more,” I think, lying prone on the rug. Above me, Herbert’s six-pack gleams god-like under the studio lights. “Come on, team!” she exhorts. I haul myself up.Considering I am working out a mere split-lunge away from my sofa, FIIT’s leaderboard helps me stay surprisingly motivated – even if I do end up languishing in 10th place, despite my best efforts to overtake “Sharron T”. (Next time!) I clock out with a heart-rate of 176bpm, feeling euphoric. Provided you have the space and the motivation, the future of digital fitness looks promising. Of course, there’s another way to work out at home that doesn’t cost anything: housework. Now, to vacuum that rug.

I went to university with plans to reinvent myself, explore new relationships and broaden my cultural horizons. As it was, by the time freshers’ fortnight was over, I had met my life partner. He was funny, wrote love limericks and had curtains that perfectly framed his delicate face. I had found a fellow nerd, but one who had come through the other side of his shy teenage years.We had a tempestuous relationship early on, with a few breakups. After another split in my final year, we got back together at the graduation ball. He moved for graduate training and I followed, but we went our separate ways shortly after in circumstances that felt final. I decided to travel across the US, spending my savings on a flight to New York that flew out on 911. I came back to the UK a month later to restart my life near my parents.Time passed, we became friends again, and then a couple, before finally moving in together, six years after we first met. A serious family health scare made marriage seem right suddenly. I was 30 and ready to settle down, but he said he wanted to wait a year before trying for children. I assumed most women are very fertile until the age of 35, so I acquiesced. I had no idea that we were about to embark on a five-year journey of unexplained infertility.After about a year of trying, we took a holiday in the Lake District to reconnect and relax. It rained constantly and, while taking refuge in a little town, we came across a music shop. I hadn’t been in one since I was a child. I had lessons then, but shied away from taking exams. In the window was an electric piano. It piqued my curiosity. The shop’s owner insisted on giving a demonstration, despite my protestations that I was on holiday, hadn’t played in years and had no space.The seed was sown. When we got home, I rejigged the front room and found a local piano dealer who sold me the model I had seen in the Lake District. He was an old guy, almost blind and hard of hearing. For 20 years he hadn’t played, but eventually went back to the piano and loved it so much that he opened a music shop. I took this to be a positive sign.I taught myself the pieces I thought I had forgotten. The tiny muscles in my fingers were weak at first. Thirty minutes’ practice felt torturous, but I felt the strength return. The desire to improve the sound coming out of my headphones was addictive. Playing the piano consumed the acres of spare time you can have as a reclusive infertile couple, which I felt we had now become. When every month’s unwanted period felt like starting back at square one, the piano allowed me to feel a sense of progress.At the same time, I repeatedly questioned why we had waited well over 10 years into our relationship to try to conceive. The only person to whom I expressed our infertility fears was my GP, as I was determined it would not define us. Keeping our own expectations in check was enough. My social life slowly contracted: I avoided drinking with friends because it felt as if it could jeopardise our diminishing chances of getting pregnant. I worked in a coffee-fuelled environment, but resorted to excuses of caffeine-induced tooth-grinding to account for my change in drinking habits.I retreated into what could have been a very destructive place. The choice of pieces I learned reflected my sense of isolation. One day, I found myself playing Ralph McTell’s Streets of London. The arrangement had beautiful arpeggios that lifted my mood despite the loneliness of the lyrics.It made me realise that I could lose myself in the melodies I was playing, even if the narrative of my life was in a minor key. I am sure playing the piano positively rewired my brain. I have no natural ability and only play for my own pleasure, but I discovered that finding pleasure was the key to feeling relief.Finally, at the age of 36, on our second round of IVF, I became pregnant with twins. Forceps and an emergency caesarean later, I found a new all-consuming passion, with two mouths to feed and entertain. My early 30s could have been bleak, but a chance rediscovery of my childhood hobby was the key change I needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48205f60c3e5f8224c41c6b1cab3c71725fe974e/0_300_5811_3488/master/5811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8de91736e2d29d6a1aa84444269a1be","title":"do not feed the pigeons and nine other unwritten rules about london","story":"London is a city with its own quirks and customs, but this Londoner’s guide will help you avoid any sticky situations when visiting the capital ...The tubeFor something that has the sole aim of getting people from A to B, the tube is fraught with potential faux pas. One main rule is that you should always stand on the right on escalators. If you dare to break this, you’ll be met with a lot of muttering and eye-rolls, although no one will dare to berate you personally. You must also never, ever make eye contact with a stranger on the tube, or, worse, smile at them.

Londoners, however, know there are better options nearby for the shopper uninterested in souvenir stores (although hats off to Selfridges, a true gem). Try Spitalfields for an East End market buzz, or Dover Street in the West End for high fashion and price tags to match.The Tower of LondonNot many Londoners have actually ever been inside this, but they do know that it’s brimming over with history, stuffed with ravens, and there are some rather nice crown jewels inside. Oh, and that there are a couple of princes still stuck in the actual tower, although we’re not exactly sure what they’re doing there.Crossing the riverOnce you are friends with a Londoner, your allegiance is not only to him or her, but to the area north or south of the river where they live. If you are loyal to someone from the north, you must never go south, and vice versa. Crossing the river is something Londoners only do in an emergency (or for work, if their job happens to be on the opposite side of the Thames from where they live), and weekends must be spent not only in one’s designated compass point, but also bad-mouthing the other.A Londoner will raise his or her head from theirs only if he or she is literally about to be run over by a bus. Otherwise, forget it. Walking down a London street is a bit like playing a game of Frogger, only you’re on a pavement, and the “cars” are phone-obsessed pedestrians. Don’t expect anyone to come and help if you’re looking lost, or start chatting if you’re in a pub everyone will be on their phone, browsing Tinder, booking an Uber, or playing whatever the modern version of Frogger is.One of London’s finest traditions is the illustrious black cab, immediately recognisable by their yellow illuminated signs, shuddering, noisy diesel engines, and adorably knowledgeable drivers, who love nothing better than to get into a debate about their favourite football team, and the performances of its starting eleven over the weekend – you can bank on the fact that each one would have played better if the driver himself was their manager, of course. It’s up to you whether you get involved in the conversation, although this may also depend on how many pints you have sampled at that other Great British institution, the pub.PubsLondon pubs tend to be full of history this also sometimes means they are full of threadbare carpet, peeling wallpaper, and musty cellars. Don’t let that stop you buying a pint of possibly overpriced lager, however, because that atmosphere does not just contain damp it also contains the breath of a thousand London icons – actors Peter O’Toole and Diana Dors, painters Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, gangsters such as the Kray Twins, and musicians from Dizzee Rascal to David Bowie.Sometimes it’s nice to leaveAs cosmopolitan and fascinating as London is, sometimes it’s nice to explore beyond it.

If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can also catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Jeremy Corbyn will promise to do “everything necessary to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit” as he delivers a speech on Monday in which he will accuse Boris Johnson of being a “fake populist and phoney outsider” in the mould of Donald Trump.The Labour leader will give a flagship speech in the key marginal seat of Corby in the east Midlands as speculation grows about an election in the coming weeks.Following the leak of documents warning of protests and food shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Corbyn will attack Johnson for the Conservative party’s “failure on Brexit, and its lurch to the hard right, which has provoked the crisis our country faces this autumn”.The shadow chancellor said on Monday morning that Labour wanted to see parliament reconvened “in the next few days” to work to avoid a no-deal Brexit.But John McDonnell insisted during an interview on the BBC’s Today programme that it was “non-negotiable” that the Labour leader should be the figure who leads any caretaker government that could emerge.Downing Street has blamed the disclosure of detailed preparations being made under Operation Yellowhammer on a hostile former minister intent on ruining Johnson’s trip to see EU leaders this week as he also prepares to make his debut at a G7 summit.The leaked document argues that the most likely scenario is severe extended delays to medicine supplies and shortages of some fresh foods, combined with price rises, if there is a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.Michael Gove, the cabinet minister responsible for no-deal planning, insisted Yellowhammer represented a “worst-case scenario” and said “significant” steps had been taken in the last three weeks to accelerate planning.But separate leaks also show that planning of a different kind – for a general election – is being ramped up.The prime minister’s No 10 operation is increasingly on an election footing, with leaked internal emails revealing he was due to meet Sir Lynton Crosby, the election guru who worked on the campaigns of David Cameron in 2015 and Theresa May in 2017.Johnson’s planned meetings with the French president and German chancellor come ahead of the G7 summit in Biarritz at the end of the week, where the PM is likely to meet the US president, Donald Trump, for talks about a potential post-Brexit trade deal.The general assumption of observers is that no one should expect a breakthrough from Johnson’s visits to Berlin and Paris to meet Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. He is scheduled to hold a working lunch on Thursday with Macron at the Elysée and issue a joint declaration.In terms of political positioning, he is expected to cling to a hardline message on Brexit and the intention of his government for Britain to leave on 31 October.For now, his position is that formal talks on Brexit will only take place until the Northern Ireland backstop is removed from the withdrawal agreement negotiated by his predecessor in No 10.Don’t expect much in the way of comment from European leaders about Operation Yellowhammer, although the Financial Times reports one senior EU official as saying that Johnson must come to the G7 with a credible proposal to prevent a hard border in Ireland.“The first thing to know is what detailed plan on avoiding a hard border Johnson has in mind – a plan that is compatible with the existing withdrawal agreement,” the official said.Looking ahead to the G7, where the ever-unpredictable Trump is likely to give an edge to proceedings, the summit marks the first real test of Johnson on the international stage (although other states will be familiar with his approach from his time as foreign secretary). One scenario being sketched out by some was the possibility of a Trump-Johnson alliance of sorts.Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP who chairs the influential Commons foreign affairs committee, said it would be interesting to see if the meeting of leaders became “another six and one, or five and two” with the UK becoming even more part of the “American camp”.Tugendhat told the BBC’s Today programme that the UK could play the role, as it had done in the past, of a “bridge” between other states and the US.That’s not quite a scenario other European leaders appear to be contemplating. British officials have been liaising with their EU counterparts on how to get on the right side of the trade war between the US and China, and are already treading a diplomatic fine line over the European-backed Iranian nuclear deal opposed by Trump.“This is a diplomatic quagmire of a G7,” one European diplomat told the .All is meanwhile being done in Brussels to get things right on the European side and to avoid a repetition of the Salzburg summit where Theresa May was seen to have been humiliated.“A frosty approach would be self-defeating,” an EU official said, while admitting that Donald Tusk, president of the European council, who will also attend, did not always toe the line.Matthew d’Ancona, the  columnist and chairman of the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue, argues that what matters now is how those in politics who want to prevent the UK experiencing a “historic disaster” respond to the challenge how imaginative they are prepared to be and whether they are ready to put nation before party:Let us address the bearded elephant in the room. I think I have made it fairly clear that I do not want Jeremy Corbyn to become prime minister and that I firmly believe he is not up to the job. But – if Johnson loses a vote of no confidence in September, triggering a 14-day period in which, by law, any MP can seek to form an alternative government – it is self-evident that Corbyn will be at the heart of any such discussions, ex officio, as leader of the opposition. I might wish that Stella Creasy or Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn held that post. But none of them does."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1b7e3b3f74ef09a7f7c4bbdbc2b48521bb43dcf/226_98_4636_2782/master/4636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e5476002d11c20bc768c17c11485837","title":"brexit latest news jeremy corbyn speech labour could be officially neutral in any second referendum campaign john mcdonnell suggests live news","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Jeremy Corbyn’s speech on Labour’s vision for BritainHere is the full text of Jeremy Corbyn’s speech in Corby.In his Q\u0026ampA Jeremy Corbyn would not commit to backing remain in a second referendum staged by Labour after a general election, and he would not rule out the party being neutral in such a contest. (See 11.46am and 11.55am.) But Corbyn has, of course, said that if there were a referendum now on a Tory Brexit, or on no deal, Labour would campaign for remain. I’ve amended the wording in those earlier posts because they did not make that clear. Sorry.Corbyn says zero-hours contracts represent a return to the insecure labour conditions that used to apply to people working at the docks. Labour would end zero-hours contracts, he says.In response to a question from a Labour supporter who asked what Corbyn would do about the media who tell lies, Corbyn says he is a member of the NUJ. A free press is very important, he says. But he says he wants to ensure that reporting is balanced, and that people have a right to reply. He set out plans for media reform in a speech in Edinburgh last year. Those plans would form the basis for Labour’s plans, he says.He says it is crucial that people who are attacked in the media get a right of reply.I will post a summary shortly.Corbyn says he represents a constituency where only around a third of people own their own homes. He wants more council housing, he says. He says Margaret Thatcher’s right to buy has led to a huge increase in the number of people having to rent from a private landlord.Corbyn says there has been a lot of speculation about what other mechanisms might be used to block a no-deal Brexit. But those options are not available yet, he says. The option that is available is a no confidence vote.Q: Why do you think so many Labour MPs do not see you as the right person to lead an interim government?Corbyn says he was elected Labour leader in 2015, to the surprise of the mainstream media. He was elected again in 2016. He is sure all Labour MPs want to join him in backing a no confidence motion against the government.Q: John McDonnell said this morning he would campaign for remain in a second referendum. Would you? And if not, can you see why remainers have doubts about your leadership?Corbyn says McDonnell was giving his personal view. He says the real issue is what must be done to end inequality in Britain.He says that if the UN produced a report about Britain under a Labour government as critical as the Philip Alston report was every media organisation would feature it very prominently.This gets a huge cheer from the Labour supporters in the audience.Corbyn says what happened to Northamptonshire council (it went bust) was symptomatic of how the Tories have underfunded local government.Corbyn is now taking questions.Q: You say you will do anything in your power to stop a no-deal Brexit. Would that include stepping aside as leader of a caretaker government?Labour supporters in the audience shout “no”. At least one person says the question is a disgrace. They also complain when a second journalist suggests Corbyn does not have enough support to become PM himself.Corbyn says he will do everthing to stop a no-deal Brexit.He is leader of the opposition, he says. All the precedent is that the leader of the opposition should be given the chance to form a government when the government falls.There is a lot of “what iffery” around, he says.He says if Tory MPs and others are serious about stopping no deal, they should support his no confidence motion. They should “get on board”, he says.Q: Do you think parliament should be recalled immediately?Yes, shout Labour members in the audience.Corbyn says he does support the recall of parliament.Q: Could Labour remain neutral in a second referendum on Brexit?Corbyn says he wants to bring people together. There has to be an understanding of why particular communities voted leave. He is offering policies that would transform society, he says.He says Labour would make sure people have the final say and the final choice.Corbyn proposes a “massive injection of democracy”.After years of elite-driven austerity and neglect, we will recharge our politics with a massive injection of democracy kicking out the big money interests and putting the people in the driving seat.And here is his peroration.We will drive up people’s living standards by boosting pay, improving rights, and running our utilities and economy in the interests of the millions, not the multi-millionaires.And we will transform our communities with investment in every part of our country breathing new life into our high streets, giving security to older people and hope and opportunities to our young people.This is a historic moment, with the potential for real change to transform our country if we grasp the opportunity.Corbyn says the future could be “fantastic” under Labour.We can’t afford more of the same, but even worse. The future could be fantastic. New technologies have the power to liberate us and help tackle the climate emergency.But for too many, the future is frightening and uncertain because those technologies have been used instead to benefit the wealthy elite while driving down pay and security for millions.The next Labour government will take on those who really run our country the bankers, tax dodgers and big polluters. So that the real wealth creators, the people of this country, can have the services, jobs and futures they deserve.Because when Labour wins, we all win. The nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the engineer wins, we all win. Corbyn turns to the climate crisis, and says Labour is that party that has shown real leadership on this.We ensured our parliament was the first in the world to declare a climate emergency.That must be followed by radical and decisive action that will only be delivered by a Labour government.It certainly won’t come from the Tories the party that scrapped the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon, effectively killing off new onshore wind power projects, and is forcing fracking on local communities who oppose it.Labour would restore public services, Corbyn says, because we understand they are the glue that binds society together.We’ll restore pride in our NHS by funding it properly and end the sell-offs and privatisation.And we’ll create a National Education Service providing free learning from the cradle to the grave including free school meals for all primary children smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds and no tuition fees at university or college.And he argues that Labour can be trusted to rebuild public services more than the Tories under Boris Johnson.Corbyn turns to the issue of crime to underline the point he has just been making.Take crime which the prime minister is now trying to turn to his political advantage, with yet more promises to tackle what the Tories have failed to bring under control for a decade.In the 2017 election, Labour won the argument that Tory cuts to the police had made people unsafe, and we pledged to hire more officers.The Conservatives have now conceded that we were right, but police cuts are not the only reason violent crime has doubled. What the Tories won’t address is the much wider impact of austerity the closed youth services under-resourced mental healthcare and the lack of funding for community mentoring.We take youth services so seriously that we will make it compulsory for local government to deliver them.Corbyn says Boris Johnson’s recent spending announcements show that Labour has won the argument on austerity.The new prime minister has been making some pre-election spending pledges over the past few weeks.That shows Labour has won the argument that austerity damages our country and that it was always a political choice.But it insults voters’ intelligence to expect them to be grateful for a bit of extra money here and there, with no confidence that it will actually be delivered when it’s Boris Johnson’s Tories who ran our public services into the ground in the first place.Corbyn summarises some Labour policies to address inequality.We’ll introduce a real living wage of £10 an hour, including for young people who deserve equal pay for equal work.But we need to go further. The problem with an unfair economy isn’t just the imbalance of wealth it’s the imbalance of power.Labour will give working people more power to win better wages and have security at work.And Labour won’t tell people they have to work until they are 75 before getting their pension, as Iain Duncan Smith’s think tank has suggested – a policy that discriminates against working class people – especially in manual jobs.It’s past time that we rewrote the rules of the economy – to shift wealth and power – from a small elite at the top into the hands of the majority.He confirms Labour’s intention to bring rail, mail, water and the national grid into public ownership.And the party would give more rights to tenants, he says, “including controlling rents, so dodgy landlords can’t rip them off”.Corbyn says Labour would tackle inequality.But together, we can take our future into our own hands and tackle the great challenges facing our country alongside Brexit inequality and an economy run for the richest public services that have been stripped back and sold off and the climate emergency threatening our children’s future.Inequality holds all of us back. It means the talent of millions of people is squandered.We don’t have to be a country of food banks and rough sleepers at one end while the super-rich dodge taxes at the other.And he says Labour would raise tax for the richest.Labour will raise tax for the richest and make sure they pay their share towards the common good.The Tories will cut tax for the richest.Labour will require the big multinational corporations to actually pay the tax they owe in this country.The Tories will cut tax for big corporations.It’s Labour that will get more money into your pocket rather than line the pockets of multi-millionaires.Corbyn says Labour would offer a real change in direction.The Tories cannot be trusted to deliver on their quick-fix promises because their first priority is tax cuts for the big corporations and the richest.The Tories can’t be trusted to deliver for the majority because they will always look after their own. Instead of fixing a failed system, they will turbocharge its inequalities, insecurities and climate destruction.Labour can be trusted to deliver to end austerity, to take on the elites and the vested interests holding people back and to transform our country for the many, not the few."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc09a9078ae72b972d968ed8c909f23b196c118/0_299_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad2540faa98efc968367d004881a9acc","title":"authorities deport children job legal aid lawyer","story":"I go home each night worrying about my clients. I wonder who would know if something bad ever happened to themI’m a legal aid lawyer. My job is to help people challenge decisions made by local authorities and government departments: I mostly work with children in the UK who are on their own and seeking asylum, and who have had their ages disbelieved.Today I help a 15-year-old boy. The local authority deems him to be 27. He was moved out of foster care, put into an immigration detention centre and told he was going to be removed from the UK. He’s now living in asylum accommodation with adults who don’t speak his language. The only thing he can cook is an egg. I arrange to pick him up from the nearest station because he won’t be able to find our office on his own. I don’t know when he last had something to eat, so I buy him food before we start our appointment. None of this is covered by legal aid.I get a call from a woman I’m helping who tells me she’s had a baby girl. She’s a single mum with a No recourse to public funds (NRPF) condition on her immigration status. She has been working 60-70 hours a week doing night shifts on a zero-hours contract but had to stop because of her mental health. She is at risk of being evicted for rent arrears. I leave the office feeling stressed. I need to get the 15-year-old’s case in with the courts but there’s a lot of paperwork to do and I’m relying on other people to provide documents. I spend the morning with our youth worker getting ready for tonight’s session with our youth group. The group has been running for 11 years as a place for young people to meet others in a similar situation, and is an attempt to combat the isolation that gnaws away at so many of them. We plan games to help them explain how it feels to have your age disbelieved. In the afternoon I finally get my 15-year-old client’s documents to the court. It’s a big relief. The group arrives some are fasting so we wait until the apps on their phones go off telling them they can break fast before we share dates, pizza and crisps together.Many of them are originally from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Eritrea. They’ve been through things I will never face but they’re still teenagers, and they berate me for my lack of sporting knowledge.My desk is surrounded by piles of files. I have to step over them to get to my chair and then I’m barricaded in. I spend the day sorting out my backlog of legal aid billing. Our charity only gets paid by the Legal Aid Agency at the end of someone’s case. We get a fixed fee of £259 per file unless I spend three times the allowed hours, then I can bill at an hourly rate. Right now I’ve got 39 open files. I make a pot of coffee it’s going to be a long day.My morning cycle to work was supposed to leave me fresh for the day but within five minutes I’m worried about getting everything done before the weekend. It’s hard to prioritise when everything is urgent. At the end of the day I manage to connect one of the young people I am supporting with a local cricket team – another child whose age has been disbelieved. He’s thrilled. He’s having a tough time living in adult accommodation in a part of town where, as a young man from Afghanistan, he sticks out. I got him a donated bike last week, but it’s been stolen already. I fill out the cricket forms with him. It asks for his next of kin. We have to put down my number as he has no one else.

Those who have completed the study have so far reported almost no relapse and no physical or psychological problems.Eleven people have so far completed the safety and tolerability study, which involves nine months of follow-ups. “We’ve got one person who has completely relapsed, back to previous drinking levels, we have five people who are completely dry and we have four or five who have had one or two drinks but wouldn’t reach the diagnosis of alcohol use disorder,” Sessa said.Most addiction is based on underlying trauma, often from childhood, explained Sessa. “MDMA selectively impairs the fear response,” he said. “It allows recall of painful memories without being overwhelmed.“MDMA psychotherapy gives you the opportunity to tackle rigidly held personal narratives that are based on early trauma. It’s the perfect drug for trauma-focused psychotherapy.”The first stage of the new study was designed to show the therapy is safe. Further research, which compares results with a randomised control group who receive a placebo instead of MDMA, will be needed to back up the treatment’s effectiveness.After preliminary screening, including medical and psychological tests, the participants are given an eight-week course of psychotherapy. In weeks three and six, they are given a powerful dose of MDMA.Sessions are conducted in a hospital with a psychiatrist and a psychologist present. Participants are given the drug and then spend eight hours with the specialists, mostly lying down, wearing eyeshades and headphones.“We let them lead the sessions as to where they want to go. What comes up comes up, so it’s not very guided by the clinicians,” said Sessa.After the MDMA-assisted sessions, patients stay overnight and are telephoned every day for a week to collect data on sleep quality, mood and potential suicide risk. Significantly, this data has shown no evidence of drug withdrawal or comedown symptoms from the MDMA.“There is no black Monday, blue Tuesday, or whatever ravers call it. In my opinion, that is an artefact of raving. It’s not about MDMA,” said Sessa, referring to recreational users of the drug, which is often associated with clubbing.“If there was a craze of people going around abusing cancer chemotherapy drugs, you wouldn’t then think: ‘Oh well, it’s not safe to take cancer chemotherapy when doctors give it to you,’” said Sessa. “Scientists know it’s not dangerous. The Sun newspaper thinks it’s dangerous because the tiny number of fatalities that occur every year all get on their front page.”MDMA was used as a legal prescription drug to enhance the effectiveness of psychotherapy in the US from the 1970s to 1985 and in Switzerland up until 1993. In recent years, MDMA therapy has been studied extensively as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, who was also involved in the study, said the research had faced financial barriers that meant it took two years to set up because of the “profound” legal constraints of working with a schedule 1 drug. “Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to get money for this from government funding. But we have a scientific credibility that will allow charitable funders to support us,” said Nutt.In response, a government spokesperson said: “We have a clear licensing regime, supported by legislation, which allows legitimate research to take place in a secure environment while ensuring that harmful drugs are not misused and do not get into the hands of criminals.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

Nevertheless, it’s worth asking: after three years, what has he accomplished – and at what cost?Over the last three years, Kenny Stills has not stuck to sports.Instead, the Miami Dolphins receiver has kneeled during the national anthem before games to protest racial injustice. Taken an off-season road trip through the American south to visit community activists and civil rights movement landmarks. Publicly called out his own boss, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, for the seeming incongruity of founding a nonprofit dedicated to racial equality – while also hosting a recent reelection fundraiser for US president Donald Trump.The timeframe of his activism, Stills said, is hardly coincidental.“Colin Kaepernick has played a really big part in helping open my eyes,” Stills said. “He’s influenced me and everything I’ve done from the time I first took a knee on September 11, 2016, to now.”Last week marked three years since Kaepernick first brought attention to police brutality against people of color by sitting during the national anthem, a protest that ultimately led to the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback’s athletic exile.Since then, Kaepernick has been awarded Amnesty International’s top honor. He has drawn Trump’s ire. He has inspired athletes like Stills, and been labeled a “traitor” by a NFL executive. He has served as the face of a multimillion-dollar Nike marketing campaign, and donated $1m to community charities. He has accused league owners of colluding to keep him out of football, and kept himself ready to play again.A persona non grata in his sport, Kaepernick stands as a symbol of conscience outside of it. Yet for the most part, the quarterback has maintained radio silence, choosing to communicate with the media and public by sharing other people’s words on Twitter.As such, it’s difficult to know exactly how Kaepernick views his time in the NFL wilderness. Nevertheless, it’s worth asking: after three years, what has he accomplished – and at what cost?“Colin is a pioneer,” said Andrew Brandt, a former NFL front office executive who now writes about the league and is a sports law professor at Villanova University. “He is a beacon for other athletes. We can all talk about his impact. But he’s also not getting to do what he wants, which is play football. He has been ostracized.”For now, at least, the answers depend on where you look.When Kaepernick first began protesting during the 2016 NFL preseason, he understood his actions would be controversial – and that he was taking a career risk.“I am not looking for approval,” he said at the time. “If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.”Before Kaepernick sat, athletes ranging from WNBA players to the five members of the Los Angeles Rams to the NBA’s LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and Dwayne Wade had taken public stances against the racial injustice and police violence that spurred the formation of the Black Lives Matter movement and protests in places such as Ferguson, Missouri.After meeting with former NFL player and US Army veteran Nate Boyer, Kaepernick switched from sitting during the anthem to kneeling, the better to “show more respect for the men and women who fight for the country.”Nevertheless, then-Republican presidential nominee Trump said that Kaepernick should “find a country that works better for him”. Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg labeled the quarterback’s actions “dumb and disrespectful”.Meanwhile, conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh echoed a critique made by some football fans, lamenting that Kaepernick’s protests reflected the “politicization of everything”.Within the NFL, reaction to Kaepernick was mixed – and largely split along racial and labor-management lines.Then-49ers safety Eric Reid and other teammates joined the quarterback’s protests. Over the course of the season, African-American players for other teams followed suit, including Malcom Jenkins, Arian Foster, and Stills.By contrast, seven anonymous league executives told journalist Mike Freeman that they wouldn’t sign Kaepernick to their teams. One called the quarterback a “traitor”. Another stated, “he has no respect for our country. Fuck that guy.”“In my career,” a NFL general manger told Freeman, “I have never seen a guy so hated by front office guys as Kaepernick.”Kaepernick entered free agency in the 2017 offseason as an accomplished performer at a position of perpetual league need. Over six seasons, the quarterback had thrown for 12,271 yards and 72 touchdown passes with just 30 interceptions rushed for 2,300 yards and 13 touchdowns and led the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance.He also had appeared on the cover of the popular Madden NFL video game.Despite that resume, Kaepernick went unsigned by the NFL’s 32 teams. In June 2017, league commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that his absence was purely the result of “football decisions”.As NFL teams subsequently hired a series of less-accomplished signal callers – including Zac Dysert, Josh Woodrum, and the immortal Matt Simms – Goodell’s assertion appeared increasingly dubious. In October 2017, Kaepernick filed a grievance against the league, accusing team owners of colluding to keep him from being signed because of his “advocacy for equality and social justice”.Last February, Kaepernick and the NFL reached a confidential settlement of the case reportedly worth less than $10m. A few weeks earlier, an anonymous survey of 85 NFL defensive players by the Athletic found that 81 believed he deserved a roster spot in the league.Today, however, Kaepernick remains a quarterback without a team – a former Pro Bowl performer whose most recent touchdown pass to a NFL player came in a March charity game.“You’ve had people who have gotten DUIs coming back to the league,” said Lou Moore, a history professor at Grand Valley State University and author of We Will Win the Day: The Civil Rights Movement, the Black Athlete, and the Quest for Equality. “Michael Vick came back to the league after dogfighting.Before Kaepernick’s first protest, Stills said, he wasn’t particularly interested in politics. He had never voted. He paid more attention to video games than to news. He didn’t know a lot about American history.“It isn’t something we talked about much in my household,” he said.Kaepernick sparked a change. Stills decided to vote in the 2016 election. He began keeping up with current events. He had long discussions with Foster, then his teammate on the Dolphins, who encouraged Stills to read and educate himself.Stills started with The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, a critique of systemic racial discrimination in the justice system, then moved on to the works of African-American literary giant James Baldwin and civil rights leader John Lewis.Stills shared what he was learning with family and friends. He organized his community service road trip. He began protesting during the anthem and also working with South Florida police, children, and community groups.“People definitely ask me to stick to sports, and I totally understand where they are coming from. You want to be entertained, and get away from all the things that are happening. But that is also coming from a place of privilege.“How do you think people feel who have lost kids to police brutality? Don’t you think they want to live their lives and be entertained like something never happened to them? I still catch passes and touchdowns and the games still go on – but these things are happening to human beings. It shouldn’t be hard to have a little bit of empathy.”Stills isn’t alone. Soccer star Megan Rapinoe took a knee during the anthem in 2016 – and since has been anything but shy in expressing her disapproval of Trump. College and high school athletes have staged anthem protests.So have American hammer thrower Gwen Berry and fencer Race Imboden, who this month protested social injustice and Trump by raising a fist and taking a knee, respectively, on the medals stand at the Pan American Games.The Players Coalition, a group of NFL players, leveraged anthem protests into a $89m social justice partnership with the league.Moore said that Kaepernick has helped revive and galvanize a tradition of athlete activism that peaked in the 1960s when Muhammad Ali refused to fight in the Vietnam War and American track athletes John Carlos and Tommie Smith gave black power salutes on the podium at the 1968 Summer Olympics.That tradition largely went dormant in the 1980s and 1990s – in part because Ali, Carlos and Smith lost work and endorsement opportunities for their actions, and in part because many athletes followed the smiling, stick-to-sports examples of superstar pitchmen OJ Simpson and Michael Jordan, who embodied an anodyne ethos reflected in Jordan’s (possibly apocryphal) proclamation that “Republicans buy sneakers, too”.Times change. Last September, the sports apparel company long associated with Jordan – Nike – featured Kaepernick in an advertising campaign with the slogan, “Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything”.“Kaepernick’s actions and then the treatment he received are really the exclamation point on this new era of athlete activism,” said Kenneth Shropshire, CEO of the Global Sport Institute at Arizona State University and author of The Miseducation of the Student Athlete: How to Fix College Sports.“A lot of people have tried to pinpoint where it began,” Shropshire said. “Was it the Rams? Was it LeBron in Miami with Trayvon Martin? What has become clear is that after folks saw Kaepernick, something different was going on.”Earlier this month, Kaepernick posted a workout video on Twitter. Referring to his ongoing exile and desire to play, the post’s caption read “5am. 5 days a week. For 3 years. Still Ready.”Brandt said that it’s unlikely that the 31-year-old free agent will get another NFL opportunity – at least not on the field.“It’s not a question of talent,” Brandt said. “There are over 100 quarterbacks on rosters right now. And no one disputes that he is a top 100 quarterback. I think for teams, it just becomes: ‘Is he worth the drama?’“But time heals all wounds. Maybe in five years, the NFL hires him for social activism. I think at some point there will be some kind of detente that does not involve him playing.”Ali, Smith and Carlos were once reviled and shunned. Today, all three are widely admired – both for taking conscientious stands and enduring the price of doing so. Ali lit the Olympic flame at the 1996 Atlanta Games, while Smith and Carlos have been honored with a fist-raising statue at San Jose State University, their alma mater.Moore said that Kaepernick will someday enjoy similar public regard.For now, Kaepernick continues to work, donating money to community charities and staging his Know Your Rights camps for young people. He also continues to wait. Last week, the NFL announced that Jay Z – who previously had expressed public support for the quarterback – would co-produce upcoming Super Bowl halftime shows and help promote the league’s social justice projects.At a press conference, however, the headlining music mogul repeatedly was asked about one man. “Everyone’s saying, ‘How are you going forward if Kaep doesn’t have a job?’” Jay Z said. “This was not about him having a job.” That much rang false, and in a larger sense true, a reminder of everything Kaepernick has lost and won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f2eda909c8004d0bb1b504744a78c34390a2383/0_153_3163_1898/master/3163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=124e63f96211661f621d4b4bedab15dd","title":"county cricket talking points t20 blast","story":"Both groups of the T20 Blast are finely poised as teams turn their attention back to the County ChampionshipBy Gary Naylor for the 99.94 Cricket BlogLancashire continued their fine season with a crushing win over Northamptonshire to all but secure qualification from the North Group with three matches to spare. Alex Davies steered them their target of 158 with an unbeaten 75, the academy product playing as a specialist batsman since Dane Vilas took captain’s dibs on the gloves. Since he was one of this column’s five county cricketers of the year in 2017, Davies’ form has dipped a little in red-ball cricket, but he enjoyed a good Blast last season and he’s back for more this time round. He’ll be 25 on Friday, still plenty young enough for international recognition, especially with England looking like they might need a little freshening up for the winter tours.Below Lancashire there’s a real dogfight brewing for the three quarter-final places not spoken for, with even bottom-placed Yorkshire not out of it with four matches to play. It might come down to a bit of luck with the weather or a tight run-out decision going one way or the other, but there are plenty of sports that would like to have this level of jeopardy so deep into a season. With the big runs being scored in the South Group, Durham will be hoping that their opening pair, Australian D’Arcy Short and local lad Scott Steel, continue the form that puts them first and fourth among the North Group’s top run scorers.In one of only two matches to beat the weather in the South, Gloucestershire eased to a win over Hampshire at Bristol. Veteran skipper Michael Klinger, short of runs this season, anchored the chase with 40, allowing wicketkeeper-batsman James Bracey to tee off, his half-century ensuring that the 140 required was banked with a couple of overs to spare. In these baffling and troubled times, the thought that Klinger is probably making 40 or so at a run-a-ball in Bristol is a comfort.Heading into the Champo break, only Glamorgan appear to be gone in the South Group, with the other eight counties looking to win the key moments and put a run together. If bowlers win matches – less obviously so with white ball than with red but probably largely true – Middlesex look best placed to make the run for the line. In Steven Finn, Toby Roland-Jones, Nathan Sowter and Tom Helm, they have a settled attack which provides half the top eight wicket-takers in the Blast. With Somerset’s gun batsmen leading their comeback and Sussex and Kent with the points on the board, don’t be surprised to see that quartet in with a chance of making Finals Day.While batting pyrotechnics captures the headlines and it’s six after six after six in the advertising montages, everyone who loves cricket knows that there’s no thriller like a low-scoring thriller – no matter the format. Worcestershire barely clawed their way to 117-7 at Chester-le-Street, no stand realising 30 runs, so when D’Arcy Short and Scott Steel were still together in the 12th over, 79 knocked off, few would have given the visitors a price. But one wicket brings two and the boundaries dried up – none in the last eight overs – and suddenly Alex Lees and Stuart Poynter needed nine off the last over. Pat Brown allowed just three singles and a couple of leg byes and Worcestershire set off down the motorway for home with a couple of points smuggled from under Durham’s noses.In the end it wasn’t much of a match, Surrey seeing off a disappointing Sussex batting effort, but the sense of occasion at the Oval was palpable. Floodlights, a full house – loud but not too rowdy – and a home side playing well in a local derby providing all the atmosphere you need. It was quite a contrast from earlier in the day at Lord’s (read more about my Thursday on either side of the Thames here) and showed that the appetite for the oldest and (for now) the youngest formats of the game remains strong, in the metropolis at least. I’m not sure that the MCC members would have been as enthusiastic as the Kennington faithful when Kiss Cam beamed out of the big screens, but each to their own.

A thick bank of black cloud blew over the Grand Stand at a quarter past seven and in the twilight of Sunday night the umpires rightly decided that it was all of a sudden so dark that the Australian batsmen could not safely face him any more, if they ever could safely face him at all. Archer had already hit Marnus Labuschagne, Tim Paine and Matthew Wade earlier in the day and that was in bright sunlight. So Archer slapped on his hat, turned his back from the crease, then strolled off to field at mid-on, despondent. Force majeure. Who knew there was a superior force out there?Archer bowled 44 overs in this match and by the time they were over he had proved himself the most lethal fast bowler in the world. On Sunday he cracked open Australia’s second innings, had David Warner caught at slip, Usman Khawaja caught behind and, later in the day, removed Paine too. But it was not just the wickets. Archer has hit 19 batsmen in the body and head in the short time he has been playing international cricket. Right now he is averaging a strike every 10 overs or so. His bowling is a test not just for Australia’s batsman but for the way the game handles these blows.There is a story about Australia’s coach, Justin Langer, from back in 2006. It was his 100th Test, a match against South Africa at the Wanderers in Johannesburg. Facing the first ball of the first innings, Langer turned away from a bouncer from Makhaya Ntini that caught him smack on the back of his helmet. Langer retired hurt and in hospital later that day he was diagnosed with a concussion and warned he would not be able to bat again in the match. One doctor even said that another blow to the head could be fatal. Langer spent the next three days in the hotel, feeling sick and sorry for himself.On the fifth day Langer decided he was well enough to travel in. Australia were 248 for six at the start of play and needed another 45 runs to win. By the time the last pair came together they were still 18 away. It was then that their captain, Ricky Ponting, came in from the balcony and found Langer, in his whites, with his pads, helmet and arm-guard on, running laps round the dressing room. “There’s no way I’m letting you do it,” Ponting told him. Langer insisted: “I’ll be all right.” They went back and forth, until Ponting finally told him he would forfeit the match rather than let him bat. In the end Brett Lee and Michael Kasprowicz won them the game anyway, so no one will know how it would have played out.That story came to mind again late on Saturday, in that 10-minute spell when Steve Smith was back in the Australian dressing room, 80 not out and insisting he was ready to go back in. “We asked him over and over again,” Langer said. “I asked him behind closed doors two or three and times and in front of the group. What else do you do?” Of course Smith wanted to go back in. Any good Australian batsman would. They grow up on stories about Dean Jones batting in the heat in Chennai, Steve Waugh scoring a century on one leg and, yes, Langer ignoring the doctors’ warning at the Wanderers.This time Smith woke up with a headache, feeling dizzy, dozy and in a fog. The night before, when he resumed his innings, he had batted as if he was lost in one, too. He started with a yahoo over midwicket against his first ball back, bowled by Chris Woakes, who beat him, in his next over, on the inside and outside, before dismissing him lbw, leaving a ball that went straight on.Cricket is still figuring out how best to handle all this. The Langer story shows the game has come a long way in a short time. But it may still have further to go. Those new protocols will need to be continuously monitored, just like Smith’s injury was. One clear change the ICC should make is to bring in independent match-day doctors at all internationals, men and women who can make the decision about whether or not a player is fit to resume batting. Australia’s doctor, Richard Saw, seemed to handle this incident very well according to the protocols but so long as he is an employee of the team there is always going to be uncomfortable conflict of interest.Beyond that there is a wider problem to work on, one that everyone who loves the game needs to address. Right now all of us players, fans and pundits are conditioned to think the admirable thing to do after being hit on the head is to carry on batting. We are still applauding players for their bravery when we ought to be chastising them for their foolishness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d0ed272c62bfe94b1af67420a27f23e347f4d00/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b71653a7354bc88ae61210fdb66df4f4","title":"talking horses nick rust ridiculed claim 98 percent under 30s have never seen horse","story":"Talking Horses Nick Rust has been unable to identify the source of his data, highlighting the need for care with statisticsWhen the alleged stat was posted on Twitter, Rust was roundly mocked for it. I asked the BHA’s press office if they could substantiate the stat and was told they could not immediately say which survey it came from. I believe that Rust heard it from someone in the industry some time ago.Rust was answering an audience question and therefore talking without a script. I give him credit for being there at all, as not every person in his position would be interested in attending the AGM of the National Association of Racing Staff.All of which suggests that, in the absence of further evidence, Rust’s stat is probably not accurate. And it matters because, while I admire Rust’s willingness to express a view, a chief executive should not be trying to back up his views with dodgy stats in a situation where he knows he will be quoted.Clearly a stat like the one he cited has the capacity to undermine racing, since it tends to suggest the wider public are not engaged with horsey sports. Rust cites it because he thinks the whip rules need to change to reflect the views of a wider society with no connection to the game, but if he is going to make that case stick, he had better get some believable insights into what those views are.I’m afraid this stat is no more convincing than his argument on Racing TV in the spring that we should all be worried because, as he said at the time: “There are offices in London now which don’t have milk in the office fridges. They don’t have it because milk is bad. Milk leads to cows being forced to be milked and more methane in society. The world is changing.”Racing’s chief executive needs to be a lot more careful about the evidence he adduces to support his arguments.I haven’t enjoyed my recent engagements with Catterick handicaps but there’s a handful of horses that catch my eye at the Scotch Corner track today. Night Law (3.00) is especially interesting at 7-1, having bounced back to winning form over this course and distance a fortnight ago, when blinkers were fitted for the first time.Yonks ago, this mare won a Sandown maiden for Andrew Balding. She lost her way handicapping for Richard Fahey the next year but she was racing off marks in the 70s. After two seasons in Ireland with low-profile trainers, she had crashed down to 46 before scoring on her third start for Katie Scott. Now up 5lb to a rating of 51, she is probably still well treated.Good Night Mr Tom (2.30) looks fairly priced at 6-4 to follow up his nursery success, his first run since being gelded, while the 15-2 shot Tapis Libre (5.35) has come down to an attractive mark and has a visor on for only the second time.Pick of the Windsor card tonight could be Perfect Refuge (7.00), a Clive Cox filly who was arguably unlucky when beaten here a fortnight ago and now has a weight pull with the winner. She’s 11-2."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c2e86f9e8cde32c394a6752ac5769c930542794/345_336_4945_2967/master/4945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d6380cffc9b1fb184007c835944d3fe","title":"edinburgh sketch shows roundup","story":"From a pastry-themed holiday to a bleak take on Thomas the Tank Engine, we round up some of the fringe’s strangest sketch actsFans of sketch comedy might have to look a little harder than normal at this year’s Edinburgh fringe, but there are a few gems lurking…The fringe often isn’t as edgy as you might imagine. The debut show by Crybabies, for example, is an absurd but affectionate take on old war romps like Biggles. This buccaneering tale of defeating the Nazis and a Rat King (don’t ask) is also a highly impressive showcase of their talents – Michael Clarke is the anchoring powerhouse, Ed Jones is remarkably versatile and James Gault has a beautifully natural comic instinct. Time and again the Julian Barratt-ish Gault steals a scene with a look or line, but like the best sketch acts, they are bigger than the sum of the parts. Fans of Max and Ivan will be at home with their style of breakneck storytelling that packs in the gags alongside moments of poignancy. ★★★★☆Speaking of less-than-edgy references, Hi-de-Hi! is getting the treatment at noon every day courtesy of double-act Chris Cantrill and Amy Gledhill. The show’s ridiculous name is entirely apposite. We are immersed in a holiday camp (Ginster’s Paradise) with Cantrill and Gledhill playing the “salmon coats”. The tone veers between wholesomely innocent and darkly shocking, as the camp and our hosts unravel. The silliness never lets up either, with the arrival of a comically oversized ice cream called Colonel Whippy in the “morning kids’ club”. The duo could easily stop at “light entertainers doing dark things” but a twist in the tale ensures this is a show of substance as well as utter absurdity. A cult hit of the 2019 fringe. ★★★★☆Also in an early slot are out-and-out sketch quartet Just These Please, who have the YouTube numbers (22m views and counting) but not quite the show to match. What marks them out from most sketch groups is a kind of formality, not just in the suits they wear but the ritualistic nods that they exchange after each sketch. Their big YouTube hit – about ordering a coffee when you have an Irish name – is one of the better skits, as is the unromantic retelling of Titanic, and the gossipy postmortem of an orgy. The show is pacy and slick and the performances strong. But the gentle ribbing of everyday observations – the waning popularity of gluten, competitive thankyou-ing and people hogging cafes to charge their phone – can be too gentle and lack spark. ★★★☆☆Jack Chisnall and Joshua Dolphin’s “bleak, provincial” sketches (their words) add up to a terrific show at the Pleasance. Their style is oddly combative, as if they’re performing in a boxing ring. The thread running through the show is that the venue is out to get them, snagging them on hooks and throttling them with the mic lead. The sketches themselves are frequently a delight, often riffing on TV tropes: they have a brainbox detective who stuffs up bad, a Monopoly debt enforcer and a rail operator who thinks he’s stuck in the world of Thomas the Tank Engine. There are unpredictable reveals and a few smartypants manoeuvres that are reminiscent of The Pin. As a sketch duo, they’re the full package. ★★★★☆"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe63dbd941def22fba828a3bc0680fb60fff5d53/785_465_4702_2821/master/4702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d304b58870b2fd56439dd976d8996c74","title":"game of thrones daniel portman podrick edinburgh fringe","story":"Renowned as the squire and surprise Casanova in Thrones, the star is now wrestling with audiences in Edinburgh. He talks about his meteoric rise to fame and why he won’t be going back to schoolDaniel Portman is soaked in sweat and locked in battle. There is an epic swell of music as he lunges at his opponent. But we’re not in Westeros, where Portman became a Game of Thrones fan favourite as steadfast squire Podrick Payne. He is centre-stage at the Edinburgh fringe, in a red unitard, arm-wrestling an audience member. Portman goes over the top, the crowd cheers and he laps up the applause.This is Square Go, a late-night rumble of a show in which he plays 13-year-old Glaswegian daydreamer Max, hiding in the school toilets with his mate Stevie, awaiting a fight with a bully. When we meet in an Edinburgh pub, I ask Portman if he always wins the arm wrestles. “Generally, yeah,” he says instantly, with easy confidence, in a voice as deep as his eyes are brown. Occasionally, some “big macho bloke” gets carried away, in which case Portman will remind him: “You’re fighting a 13-year-old boy who’s doing this in his fantasy world. So I’m gonna cheat to win.” He smiles. “Some people take it really seriously.”This is what the show is about: how boys hide behind bravado right through adulthood. But there’s no lecturing or hand-wringing. At the start, Portman strides in like a wrestling pro, getting the audience to feel the steel and chant his character’s name. Max is psyching himself up for his “square go” – Glaswegian slang for a fight – but soon crashes back to reality. “You’re gonnae get pure tabernacled,” Stevie reminds him.A high-octane hour, Square Go is performed in the round. “It’s exhausting,” says Portman. “The energy is like a vortex.” He’s superb in the play – as is Gavin Jon Wright as Stevie. It’s clearly a hoot to perform. Portman and Wright, who were in Black Watch together a few years back, have nailed the comic timing of the “your maw” gags and putdowns that come thick and fast in Kieran Hurley and Gary McNair’s script. In this very physical role, Portman proves a nimble comedian, trembling as he bobs and weaves. He is slammed to the floor repeatedly by Wright and mercilessly whacked with a blow-up wrestling doll.Everything is OTT, including a thumb war staged like an arena-sized showdown. “When you’re that age, your universe is school,” says Portman. “It is funny that it’s so grand and operatic in scale but it’s nuclear to these guys. This is the end of the world. The way these characters in Max’s mind are portrayed is slightly ridiculous – the luchador mask, inflatables, a guy with a big foam finger – but at that age you feel everything more.”Portman grew up in Glasgow and had “a leftwing upbringing, open-minded and fair”. His dad is the actor Ron Donachie, his mum a complementary therapist. Could he relate to Max? “I never felt any pressure at home but outside the house I did feel pressure to be tough. The only acceptable emotion outside the house was anger, if there was anything. Sadness wasn’t allowed.” He says he was arrogant: “I was naturally quite big and athletic and I certainly imposed myself on people.” It was through insecurity, he acknowledges, but then borrows a line from the play: “Every dick’s got a reason for being a dick – it doesn’t change the fact I was a dick.”What was Portman up to at Max’s age? “Kicking a football around, having a pretty good time of it.” Did he have his own square go? “I got into quite a few scrapes when I was young. They always made me very sad.” In hindsight, he says, he’s sort of glad. “Some men, if they haven’t had that experience, they maybe carry it into adulthood. They still feel like they have something to prove. I don’t have that.” By the end of Square Go, the venue becomes stifling and reminds Portman of school fights: “If something was going to kick off it got hot. You could smell it.”The end of Portman’s school experience was soured by “some very nasty rumours spread about me by a couple of guys who were very close to my heart”. He says he ended up with almost no friends. Part of the problem was that he’d embarked on an acting career. “It makes people uncomfortable. They go, ‘Do something real.’” Apparently, this extended to the staff, with the exception of his drama teacher. “The same teachers who told me not to do it have asked me to go back and talk to pupils about how much the school gave me. Go fuck yourself. There’s no chance. If I do come in, I’ll say, ‘Don’t listen to these people.’”This is his first summer performing at the fringe, and Portman feels as if he’s cheating because his show is selling out and he doesn’t have to flyer it. He remembers travelling from Glasgow when he was younger and watching free shows back-to-back all day. He’d grown up seeing his dad on telly – Casualty one night, The Bill the next – and the big screen, notably as the master-at-arms in James Cameron’s Titanic. Donachie even went on to have a small role in Thrones, as Ser Rodrik Cassel.Portman made his acting debut with a youth theatre group – playing Moonface, a gangster disguised as a priest – in the Cole Porter musical Anything Goes. Looking at him today, dressed in black with an open face that seems both solemn and saintly, yet has the widest smile, the casting still makes sense.That production’s boozy last-night celebrations had disastrous results. “I gave my then girlfriend my jacket. By the time we got to the after party I was fucked. I woke up the next day and had pneumonia. I was out of action for a month.” On his first day back to school, there happened to be a casting session for a Scottish horror film Outcast, starring James Nesbitt. Portman auditioned on his 17th birthday and got a walk-on part.What happened next? A bit of theatre at the Òran Mór in Glasgow, the BBC Scotland soap River City and “then Game of Thrones came up”. The biggest show on the planet appears in conversation as casually as it pops up on Portman’s sparse IMDb page. Was he intimidated, arriving on set? Nervous, yes, he answers. “But not overwhelmed.”Was he daunted by the now famous orgy scene, where Podrick gives a group of prostitutes such pleasure that they refund his payment? “When you’re 20 and on a big TV show and the writers tell you your character is about to become the greatest lover in the world” – he pauses – “you tell me how you’d feel!” The scene led to some “interesting journeys” he laughs. The reports earlier this year about him being groped by fans at conventions were blown out of proportion he says, but adds: “It has happened a few times, with men and women doing it. It has given me a bit of an insight into what women have to deal with sometimes and it’s very, very unpleasant.”Portman first auditioned for two characters who were bumped off in season two. The producers invited him to audition instead for Podrick, who survived to season eight. After the series wrapped, he was told Podrick was meant to be in just two or three episodes but they “liked having him around”.Podrick is a loyal servant of Brienne of Tarth, the resolute warrior played by Gwendoline Christie. She tells me Portman has “a wonderful capacity for enjoying the absurd”, which was useful during “long days swathed in mud or submerged in water wearing leather and metal clothes”. Does she think Portman has anything in common with Podrick? “A mellifluous singing voice,” she responds, “and impossibly jutting cheekbones.”Portman auditioned in his own voice and in received pronunciation, and the Thrones producers chose RP for Podrick. “There weren’t any Scottish accents in the show,” he says. “I don’t really know why not. Maybe they were worried people in the States wouldn’t understand.” The majority of his encounters with fans are friendly but “people do take the piss sometimes and think they can push me around. They expect to get Podrick Payne. They expect this shy, timid, little English boy. That’s not what they get.”Portman’s next stage role is in The Last King of Scotland, an adaptation of Giles Foden’s novel, in which he will play the medic who becomes personal physician to Idi Amin. It opens in Sheffield in September. For now he is clearly over the moon to be in Edinburgh. His Thrones pal Joe Dempsie and he were having a few drinks the other day and were handed flyers for Thrones! The Musical Parody. “They say they ‘fix the final season’,” he observes. He’s planning to pop along. “I just hope they don’t try and drag me on stage.” Meanwhile, he’s looking forward to his family seeing Square Go. He cracks a mischievous smile. “I’ll see if I can get my old man up for the arm wrestle.”• Square Go is at the Roundabout, Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e9ed7161e9ec2e74bd3152efc6d1336f5f9f61d/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=208752e15c21f94840b928f649699d5c 1400w","title":"city swimming rhine basel switzerland sightseeing","story":"Bathing, barbecues and buvettes are part of the culture in a city that promotes swimming in its majestic river – and it’s a chance for some great sightseeing, tooIf you want to join the many swimmers who leap into the Rhine each summer you can’t do the British wade-in – arms in the air, considering whether the water is for you. You have to commit. You have to give yourself to the river and let it be your guide.I tested out my technique – and bravado – when I visited Basel during Europe’s recent heatwave, when temperatures in the city reached 38C. Fortunately for me, the Swiss have led the way in city swimming: for decades, cities such as Basel, Berne, Zurich and Geneva have been making rivers accessible and safe for swimmers. Developments in the 1980s included building sewage treatment facilities and erting domestic wastewater away from the river, and concrete steps were built for easier access to the water, and guidelines and maps published for swimmers.The Rhine sweeps through the medieval city and is an important trading route. Large flat-bottomed barges share the water with swimmers. Despite the shipping monsters and urban riverbanks, the water isn’t rife with litter or pollution. In fact, it reminded me of moonstone, a pearlescent blend of blues and greens, surprisingly clear. It is fast-flowing and constantly swirling, eddies forming around bridge pillars.I entered the water from the popular swimming beach of Einstieg Rhyschwimme at the foot of art-packed Museum Tinguely. Most people swim between the Schwarzwald and Johanniter bridges and let the current take them downstream. A sign displays a swimmer’s map, developed in 1984, marking the safe swimming area. There is a makeshift changing room and a couple of toilets, but that’s it. No lifeguards. Swimmers enter the water at their own risk.I put all my belongings, including my purse, phone and passport, into a Wickelfisch. These brightly coloured fish-shaped bags, sold all over the city keep clothes and possessions dry for the duration of a trip down the Rhine. I watched other swimmers entering the water: office workers folded suits and loaded Wickelfisch confidently with laptops tourists fumbled and followed, as did I.The fast flow swept me downstream. This isn’t for nervous swimmers: you are immediately out of your depth as you enter the strong stream and water aids are prohibited. I’m an experienced swimmer and the current still unnerved me: my instinct was to swim, kick and control, but relaxing into the flow was the best way.There is plenty of room, with large red buoys marking the swimming area off from that used by boats. The adventure is just over 2km of downstream floating and I had a stupid grin on my face the whole way. Floating down a fast-flowing city centre river goes against all the “rules” we like to outline to swimmers in the UK: like knowing your exit point, and urban areas being often unclean, unsafe. But this was the perfect way to see the sights.I passed the first of four historic ferry boats that take passengers across the river powered solely by the current. Basel is famous for its blend of historic buildings, such as the Basler Münster (cathedral) and contemporary museums, apartments and commercial buildings. From the water you get a great view of how the city has developed. I swooshed through the arches of Mittlere Brücke, built in 1226 and in no time at all found myself in the midst of the city, looking at riverbanks draped with sunbathers.Concrete steps at the water’s edge offered swimmers a number of exit opportunities. I set my eyes on orange and green parasols surrounding a popular buvette – an outdoor bar that only operates in summer months. Exiting the water was almost as unsettling as getting in, though. I narrowly missed a string of wooden boats before planting my feet. The whole trip took about 30 minutes and all I wanted to do after was walk back upstream and do it all over again.Later in the week I joined Selina Speck from the SLRG (Swiss Life Saving Society) for another dip in the Rhine. Selina told me it is rare that people get in trouble, and if they do it is often because they misjudge their own swimming ability. We took the same route together, only this time we walked back upstream afterwards, drank iced tea from buvettes and ate ice-cream on the warm slabs of concrete that dried our bodies before we plunged back in.Selina explained that the current is usually faster and water level higher than in this hot summer week, so what I had experienced was tame. I spent the afternoon with Selina both of us just in swimwear, not thinking twice about the fact we were walking around the city clad like this. Along the embankment on the Kleinbasel side of the river there are plenty of places to get into and out of the water.Swimming in the Rhine feels like you are in the soul of the city but Basel has plenty else on offer. Its history is fascinating and I found myself walking the same steps with new eyes after an hour’s walking tour with a guide uncovering secrets of the city. I discovered that bathing in Basel isn’t just reserved for the Rhine more than 200 historic fountains across the city are also popular for cooling off in.The Swim City exhibition at the Swiss Architecture Museum until 29 September is a celebration of bathing culture in cities across the world and a look at how swimming in cities could look in the future. Exhibits include the Thames Bath: a floating river pool on the river in central London and +POOL – a development that would allow New Yorkers to swim in the Hudson River.If the sweeping river current isn’t for you, river culture can be soaked up in one of two bathing houses that sit on stilts on the riverbank. Constructed in 1898, the large metal-and-wooden structures offer sunloungers, parasols, changing facilities, and steps down to less-lively water under the stilts for around £5 a day. The Rheinbad Breite bathing house sits opposite the swimmers’ beach on the south bank. Sitting in its restaurant, Le Rhine Blue, I loved watching swimmers sweep past beneath the wooden slats at my feet while I ate antipasti and sea bream.I’ve always associated Switzerland with winter travel or suits on business trips but as soon as the temperature allows, Basel is all about bathing, barbecues and buvettes. In this city centre a swimsuit is the typical summer outfit.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

I folded away the seaside cabin’s mini-table, switched off the radio and stepped out on to the porch, waiting for my eyes to adjust to a night sky packed with stars. It was spellbinding. The north-east coast, with its castles, characters and legends, has magic everywhere, and miles of long beaches on which to contemplate it all.My wife, Mim, and I had travelled by train to Alnmouth for a car-free weekend getaway, with the historic coastal village as our base (a 20-minute stroll from the station). We’d soon settled in, sitting on the cabin’s steps to drink tea and eat bacon rolls while listening to the sea, not crashing but idling. Within a few hours, a spell had been cast, and cares packed away, replaced by fresh air and relaxation.This area of outstanding natural beauty is home to many treasures. But how best to explore them? Easy: arrive by train, hire a bike, take buses, and walk. Alnmouth station is on the east coast mainline, so travelling from London (or Peterborough, Doncaster, York, Newcastle and Edinburgh) was a book-reading, nap-taking, coffee-sipping three hours and 41 minutes from King’s Cross.We arrived at Alnmouth’s Old School Gallery in the early afternoon, with the weather still pondering: breezy sunshine or windy grey-fest. As I chatted to Dale and Penny who run the gallery and its cafe, where vegetable frittata, couscous and salad (£8) kept us filled till bacon-roll time, I sensed Dale’s disappointment at the prospect of drizzle, or worse.The couple also own our weekend billet. Shoreside Huts are three off-grid seaside cabins a short walk from the village, and which opened in May. Designed by local Riba award-winning architecture firm Elliott and artist and joiner Adam Clarke, they have a stylish, wooden simplicity, with double bed, solar lights, washroom with composting toilet, log-burner, sofabed and space-saving ingenuity (although for now, showering means a trip back to the gallery).Waking with the sunrise and a view of the sea is how I wish I started all my days but it’s not viable to live on just bacon and tea, so we left our cabin – St Aidan – for breakfast in Scott’s Deli in Alnmouth (orange juice, granola, salmon and egg on brioche). There, families, locals and lycra-clad would-be peloton members were setting themselves up for the day as we studied our route to Bamburgh on the 418 bus (Discover day ticket £6.50pp).The route meandered through countryside and along the coast, passing villages we could have jumped off at to explore. Instead, we eavesdropped on walkers plotting routes from Embleton and Low Newton-by-the-Sea that would take them on St Oswald’s Way. This 97-mile footpath runs from Holy Island to equally blessed-sounding Heavenfield, close to Hadrian’s Wall in the south of the county. After an hour and 10 minutes on the bus, Bamburgh and its 11th-century castle (adult £11.25, 5-16s £5.50, family £28) came into view.Mim deemed the castle not damaged-looking enough: she prefers them as ragged as possible. Still, we toured its state rooms, took in tales of dragons and ghosts and discovered you can live there, in rented apartments. We had ice-cream from Wyndenwell on Front Street, and wandered to Bamburgh’s magnificent beach for a stroll south to Seahouses.On the horizon were the Farne Islands, and their two lighthouses, one of which was home to Grace Darling, and whose story is affectingly told at Bamburgh’s RNLI museum (admission free). Darling and her father, William, tended the Longstone lighthouse and on 7 September 1838 risked their lives in a storm to rescue passengers and crew from the stricken SS Forfarshire. They did so in a wooden boat not much longer than a family estate car. Grace’s reward was a celebrity that meant constant intrusion from an admiring public, hastening her early demise from TB. Bamburgh, with its stone-fronted houses, feels genteel, but Seahouses is a typical seaside town of fish and chips and arcades. And so our two-hour walk ended with a stop at Lewis’s (haddockcod and chips £9) before taking the X18 bus back to Alnmouth.At first glance, Alnmouth had appeared scenic but sleepy. Yet its main road, Northumberland Street, is home to pubs including the Red Lion, the Tea Cosy Tearoom, the highly regarded Beaches restaurant, and a shop for hut supplies. There’s even an ironic slice of village history, too: what used to be the home of its anti-smuggling officer in the 18th century is now the Aln Gift Shop.On our first afternoon we had waited on Alnmouth’s Riverside Road for Adam from the Bike Shop in nearby Alnwick to deliver our hire bicycles (from £25 a day, deliverypickup available). We saw how the Aln estuary curved around the village to meet the sea, and looked over to Church Hill – the cross at its summit an evocative vision amid mottled skies. Adam’s suggested route – an easy ride on Sustrans National Cycle Route 1 to Warkworth and its castle – proved a highlight. He also tipped Bertram’s in Warkworth for lunch: its crab cakes (£9.95) and apple crumble (£4.95) fuelled our return ride to Alnmouth.• Accommodation was provided by Shoreside Huts (from £80 a night, sleeps 2, canopyandstars) and rail travel by LNER, which has advance online fares between London King’s Cross and Alnmouth from £22.50 one wayLooking for a holiday with a difference?

Torrential rain came down an hour into the rally, turning the park into a sea of umbrellas. At the same time, protesters walked towards Central, the heart of Hong Kong’s business district, and surrounded government headquarters.Police had turned down a plan for Sunday’s march submitted by the Civil Human Rights Front group and gave permission only for a rally in the park. Those defying the ban risked being charged with unlawful assembly, which can lead to up to five years in prison.“Stand with Hong Kong! Fight for freedom!” protesters shouted at the rally.Throughout the afternoon, streets around Victoria Park were so densely packed that the march frequently came to a complete standstill. Some protesters walked on to a flyover near the park as the crowds on the streets were unable to move.Protesters were orderly but burst into choruses of slogans as they waited to move forward. “Hong Kong people, go!”, “Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our era!” they chanted.Observers saw Sunday’s rally, the largest in weeks, as a test of the movement’s momentum and public support as tensions between police and protesters have escalated.“Even though the weather was so bad, even in the face of threats of the People’s Liberation Army and water cannons, Hong Kong people never back down,” said Wong, 21, a university student.Wong did not expect this to be the last major rally. “For as long as the government doesn’t respond, there will only be more large-scale protests.”US president Donald Trump said on Sunday he wanted to see the crisis resolved peacefully, warning against any hardline crackdown.“I think it’d be very hard to deal if they do violence, I mean, if it’s another Tiananmen Square,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey. “I think it’s a very hard thing to do if there’s violence.”Organisers of the rally, who estimated that 1.7 million people turned up at the park and in the nearby Causeway Bay and Tin Hau areas, said many more were unable to get there. Train services to the metro stations near the park were suspended intermittently throughout the day due to the huge numbers of people.The crowd was a mix of young protesters, families and elderly residents. Parents walked alongside small children.By early evening, protesters occupied a six-lane road outside the government in Admiralty, shining lasers at the building and the nearby People’s Liberation Army garrison and yelling insults at the police. After convoys of police vans were seen entering the government complex, protesters called for a retreat and the crowd gradually dispersed. A statement from the force late on Sunday condemned the protesters and accused them of paralysing traffic in the area.As protesters marched past the police headquarters, they chanted, “Return the eye!” referring to a recent incident in which a young woman’s eye was badly injured during the protests. Both the government and police headquarters were surrounded by giant water-filled barricades.In the early evening, a number of protesters ignored the organisers’ advice to leave after reaching Central and continued to march west towards the Chinese government’s liaison office, where previous protests have ended in violent clashes. Dozens of riot police officers armed with shields and guns were seen patrolling the area.Organisers insist that the Hong Kong government must stop using the police force to suppress them and respond to their five political demands, including the complete withdrawal of the now suspended extradition bill – under which iniduals can be sent to China for trial – the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence, and universal suffrage (the free election of Hong Kong’s leaders).A late-night government statement said although the protests were peaceful, they caused inconvenience to the community. The statement said it was “most important” to restore social order and “the government will begin sincere dialogue with the public, mend social rifts and rebuild social harmony when everything has calmed down”.The Civil Human Rights Front had earlier called for a “peaceful, rational and non-violent” rally and online posts urged “self discipline and calmness” after 10 weeks of intensive protests, many of which have ended in violent clashes as police increasingly employed teargas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds.“China is taking over Hong Kong. Our society has no justice and no future. We’re just making a last-ditch attempt to do something amid our despondency,” said Carol Lui, a teacher in her 30s. “Hong Kong is dying anyway, so we are just fighting to our last breath.”Hong Kong had its first teargas-free Saturday for weeks after three separate rallies took place in Kowloon. The marches this Saturday and Sunday marked the 11th weekend of protests in Hong Kong.Tensions reached a new level during the past week. Following last weekend’s violent clashes with police, protesters occupied Hong Kong’s airport. Over the past week, state media outlets have published videos showing armoured Chinese troop carriers purportedly driving into Shenzhen, the south-eastern state that borders Hong Kong.Chinese officials have also released a series of threatening statements about Hong Kong’s protesters, with one claiming “terrorism” was emerging in the city after flights were cancelled.Despite the call for peace on Sunday, some protesters have warned that the protests could turn violent again if the government continues to ignore their demands.“Violent escalation is an extreme measure … but if it is effective, we would continue, because we need to try all means to attract attention to our cause,” said a 25-year-old engineer wearing full protective gear who gave his surname as Fan.Janice Hui and Clea Skopeliti contributed to this article"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3990086.1566210008!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"student who came to ireland from syria with little english gets 602 leaving cert points","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNour Aljarad, who was granted asylum in Ireland in 2015 with her family, has secured a place to study dentistry at Trinity College in September. A 17-year-old student who arrived in Ireland from Syria four years ago with only basic English skills has scored more than 600 points in her Leaving Cert.Nour Aljarad, who was granted asylum in Ireland in 2015 with her family, has secured a place to study dentistry at Trinity College in September.Ms Aljarad has always been interested in dentistry, however, she says it was the “artistic side” of the profession that led her to select it as her first choice on the CAO form.“I always like makeup and I saw dentistry as a form of art. It fascinated me how a person’s smile can boost their confidence. I have friends with braces who talk about how excited they are to smile when they come off.”Her love of science also played a role in the decision. “I’ve loved science since day one. I had amazing teachers who talked about science so passionately, it was impossible not to like it with them around.”Last week, on August 13th, Ms Aljarad and her parents drove the short distance from their Stillorgan home in Dublin to St Raphaela’s secondary school to collect her results. After months of stress, exhaustion and tears Ms Aljarad was still deeply unsure whether she had achieved the high points necessary to secure a place at Trinity College. “I thought there was no way I could get 590. I knew the points were crazy for dentistry.” She was totally shocked to discover that she had, in fact, scored 602 points with H1s in five of her subjects - chemistry, physics, biology, Arabic and Japanese, which she started learning two years ago.‘Over the moon’“When I first got the envelope I kept it for myself, I didn’t want anyone else to look at it. But then I saw all the H1s and thought this is amazing. I was jumping for like an hour, I was over the moon. My mum is still jumping!”Ms Aljarad was 12 years old when she, her parents and two older sisters left Damascus. The family spent their first few months in Ireland at the Ballyhaunis direct provision centre in Co Mayo before moving to Dundalk. During this time Ms Aljarad and her sisters attended two different schools.In November 2015, the family’s story appeared in the  New to the Parish series where they spoke about their struggle to find a house in Ireland. Shortly after the article appeared, a member of the Stillorgan-Kilmacud parish came forward with an offer that the community pay housing and education bills for the family for two years. Convincing a landlord to rent a home to the Syrian family was difficult but eventually, in spring 2016, the family unpacked their bags.“Every time we started to settle we had to move to another place,” remembers Ms Aljarad. “But then we finally went to St Raphaela’s. It probably took all of second and half of third year to have the confidence to speak English. But as I found friends I was comfortable to be around my language got better and I become more familiar with the system. Plus, people were so nice to us.”Without the support of the Kilmacud community, Nour doubts she would be in the position she is today, about to embark on her university studies in Dublin. “They definitely made things easier for us and helped my family a lot. They made them stronger and provided support. I know without them we definitely wouldn’t be here today. They’re still a huge help and a big part of our life.

Photograph: Neil HallEPABritish pro-Brexit MP Marcus Fysh has described leaked British government papers outlining the effects of a no-deal Brexit as the work of people who do not want Brexit to happen.The documents, published by the Sunday Times warn of a hard Irish border, a three-month “meltdown” at ports and shortages of food and medicine if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.There is a need to ensure everyone involved in cross border trade is ready for Brexit, that they have the correct documents “so they can get across the border efficiently.”He said that the documents had been “left in a pub for journalists to find. We know lots of people don’t want Brexit to happen. This is their last throw of the dice.”Mr Fysh said he wanted to work with all the hauliers and traders in Ireland to ensure that the no-deal is a smooth experience for everyone.On the same programme, the DUP’s Sammy Wilson said that the UK Treasurery department that had drawn up the report warning about Brexit, was the “most discredited arm of government.”They had made inaccurate predictions in the past. “There is a war of words going on here. Some people are desperately trying to find a way to persuade people to back out by 31st October.“Just because someone believes it doesn’t mean it’s true. They are blinded by their prejudice.IBECAlso commenting on the documents, IBEC’s chief economist Gerard Brady said the Government should be planning for a no-deal Brexit by putting legislation and funding in place “no matter what the outcome”.A no-deal scenario will mean a downturn with cuts to investment, Mr Brady told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.He said the Government will need to ensure the national investment plan is maintained because it will “prop up” the regional economy.Companies that import from the UK will also be “badly impacted” as well as those who export, said Mr Brady.Uncertainty about a no-deal Brexit will mean that businesses will cut investment which will stall growth, he warned.But it will not just be businesses that will be impacted by a no-deal Brexit, he said. There will be a significant impact on householders.There are also further threats in the global economy that will have an impact such as trade wars and the € 800million in business that will be exposed to tariffs threatened by US president Donald Trump, especially in the dairy and whiskey sectors.“This is a very difficult and new situation that we’ve never been through before. For the indigenous sector this is new ground and it will be very bad. SMEs will also be affected by the uncertainty of new trading relationships.”There will be pressure on cash flow for companies, and many will go out of business, said Mr Brady.Open GovernmentMinister of State for Public Procurement, Open Government and eGovernment, Patrick O’Donovan warned that a no-deal Brexit is not going to be good for either the UK or Ireland.Even if contingency plans are in place there was never going to be a seamless transition, he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.“We are looking at scenarios that protect Northern Ireland’s economy and the Good Friday Agreement. This is about protecting the peace process.”Following the publication of the leaked documents, Michael Gove, the British Cabinet Minister who is responsible for no-deal preparation, said the document was “old” and Brexit planning had accelerated since Boris Johnson became prime minister in the UK. However, Mr O’Donovan said that the document was only a month old and was still relevant.The Irish government is working with the European Commission on ways to cope with a no deal Brexit and the prospect of physical infrastructures, he added. Some people who might attempt to take advantage of such a situation “haven’t gone away” and there was a danger they could attempt “some warped campaign.”The UK government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and as such have a responsibility to protect it, he added. When asked about freedom of movement for EU citizens in the UK after 31st October, Mr O’Donovan pointed out that the Common Travel Area agreement between Ireland and the UK predates membership of the EU and therefore was still in place.However, a seamless transition is “absolutely critical” he said. “There cannot be physical infrastructures along the border, “the day that they appear is the end of the peace process.”The people on the border are the ones with the most to lose. “We have to make sure that Northern Ireland is protected. Peace trumps everything.”The leaked documents were compiled this month by the UK cabinet office under the codename Operation Yellowhammer.“Ministers have taken their foot off the pedal in terms of preparations for all Brexit outcomes and we are now playing catch up,”Fianna Fáil Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said, adding that the leaked documents “should act as a wake-up call to the very real possibility that the UK will crash out of the EU on October 31st and Ireland will be left reeling in the aftermath” .Labour party leader Brendan Howlin said that the information in the leaked documents had been objective and was compiled by civil servants who had conducted a competent analysis.“Operation Yellowhammer was not a single analysis in time. It was not from just one department. It was from the Cabinet office, drawn up by 56 civil servants.”In regard to Irish government plans for a no-deal Brexit he said there needed to be a clear understanding of what resources will be available to the sectors that will be hit the most. It was unfortunate that there was too much reliance on Dublin port and there should be more focus on ports like Rosslare, Foynes and Cork.He said, “It is essential that the Irish Government accelerate no-deal planning. Central to these preparations and missing to date has been the level of material support available for Ireland from the EU.”A Government spokeswoman said: “Intensive no-deal planning continues apace, as set out in the latest contingency plan published by the Government last month.”TalksTaoiseach Leo Varadkar is expected to speak to British prime minister Boris Johnson – who has promised the UK will leave the EU, deal or no deal, by October 31st – this week.Mr Johnson is demanding that the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border, is abolished in order for there to be an orderly UK exit. He will also meet French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel in the coming days.The EU and Irish Government have consistently said the Brexit withdrawal agreement, which contains the backstop, will not be renegotiated.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Its destination was not immediately clear.A crew member looks over the side of the tanker at its new nameIran\u0027s ambassador to Britain, Hamid Baeidinejad, had written on Twitter earlier that the vessel was expected to leave on Sunday night, adding that two engineering teams had been flown to Gibraltar.The tanker\u0027s detention ended last week, but a federal court in Washington on Friday issued a warrant for the seizure of the tanker, the oil it carries and nearly $1 million.Gibraltar said on Sunday it could not comply with that request because it was bound by EU law.The EU sanctions regime against Iran – which is applicable in Gibraltar - is much narrower than that applicable in the US, the government said in a statement.The Gibraltar Central Authority is unable to seek an Order of the Supreme Court of Gibraltar to provide the restraining assistance required by the United States of America.Washington had attempted to detain the Grace 1 on the grounds that it had links to Iran\u0027s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which it has designated a terrorist organisation.US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that Iran would like to talk, attributing the willingness to economic conditions in the country, when asked on Sunday by reporters about the status of the tanker.“Iran would like to talk but they just don’t know how to get there. They are very proud people. But their economy is crashing, crashing.“Inflation is through the roof. Their economy is doing really badly, they are not selling oil. We put the sanctions on, the oil is selling much less, much less than we thought. It’s like a trickle.“They very much want to make a deal, they just don’t know how to make a call, because they are proud people and I understand that.“But I have a feeling that things with Iran could work out, or maybe not.Iran has denied the tanker was ever headed to Syria.Tehran said it was ready to dispatch its naval fleet to escort the tanker if required.The era of hit and run is over ... if top authorities ask the navy, we are ready to escort out tanker Adrian, Iran\u0027s navy commander, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, was quoted as saying by Mehr news agency.Earlier on Sunday, video and photographs showed the tanker flying the red, green and white flag of Iran and bearing its new name, painted in white, on the hull. Its previous name, \u0027Grace 1\u0027, had been painted over.Rising tensions between UK, US and IranThe initial impounding of the Grace 1 sparked a diplomatic row that escalated when Tehran seize a British-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf two weeks later. That tanker, the Stena Impero, is still detained.The two vessels have since become pawns in a bigger game, feeding into wider hostilities since the United States last year pulled out of an international agreement to curb Iran\u0027s nuclear programme, and reimposed economic sanctions.Iran has denounced US efforts to set up an international maritime security coalition in the Gulf and insisted regional countries could protect the strategic waterway and work towards signing a non-aggression pact.On a trip to Kuwait on Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a tweet that Iran\u0027s proposal for Regional Dialogue Forum and non-aggression pact trumps reliance on extraneous actors.The Grace 1 had originally flown the Panamanian flag but Panama\u0027s Maritime Authority said in July that the vessel had been de-listed after an alert that indicated the ship had participated in or was linked to terrorism financing.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Ataer\u0026nbspnow has exclusive rights to look into Britain’s second-largest steelmaker in greater detail over the next two months as part of due diligence.\u0026nbsp“During the exclusivity period, close negotiations will be held with customers, suppliers and employees who will play an important role in the future success of British Steel,” Oyak said.If due diligence is finalised\u0026nbspsuccessfully in October, the transfer of the company will be completed by the end of this year, it added.The official receiver for British Steel said: “I have now received an acceptable offer from\u0026nbspAtaer\u0026nbspHoldings AS for the purchase of the whole\u0026nbspbusiness and\u0026nbspI am now focusing on\u0026nbspfinalising\u0026nbspthe sale.“I will be looking to conclude this process in the coming weeks, during which time British Steel continues to trade and supply its customers as normal.”The deal will throw a lifeline to the steelmaker’s 5,000 workers, most of them in the UK, and another 20,000 people employed in its supply chain.It was put into compulsory liquidation after a breakdown in talks between the government and British Steel’s owner\u0026nbspGreybull Capital,\u0026nbspwhich bought the company for £1 just weeks before the EU referendum in 2016.The government had lent British Steel £120m\u0026nbspbut Greybull asked for more to deal with “Brexit-related” issues. However, the then business secretary Greg Clark said there remained no legal options to provide further financial support. Insolvency experts called the company’s collapse “the first heavyweight casualty of\u0026nbspBrexit”.British Steel had\u0026nbspbeen struggling with falling orders from EU customers, which it said were\u0026nbsplinked to uncertainty around tariffs on steel after Brexit. ​Steelmakers had\u0026nbspalso been damaged by a weak pound that had\u0026nbsppushed up the cost of raw materials and a flood of cheap imports from China.Business secretary Andrea Leadsom\u0026nbspwelcomed the provisional deal, saying it was an important step in saving British Steel.Trade union Unite said the news was a relief but added that the government must still help British Steel and the wider UK steel industry tackle high energy costs and business rates.\u0026nbsp“It is also essential that the government acts to prevent a disastrous no-deal Brexit which would lead to cheap steel being dumped in the UK market,” said Harish Patel, the union’s national officer for steel.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, all the same, he has a strong case. “Do you know what percentage of people live in Asia?” he asked. I guessed around 50 per cent. It turns out to be 60 per cent. 4 billion people in Asia. A mere 700 million in Europe. QED.\u0026nbspNivern, now 37, is a posterboy for the utility of studying modern languages. At 14 he went on a school exchange to Paris. Brought up in Manchester, he found himself living across the street from the Louvre. At 17 he got a summer job in a factory outside Paris, packing cakes in boxes, where he was known as “Anglais”. “I was impressed that, even in the industrial zone, they still stopped for a proper lunch with a baguette and a bottle of wine.”This was the summer of 1998, the year of the Mondial in France. He tried – and failed – to get into the World Cup final at the Stade de France, but watched France beat Brazil 3-0 on a screen outside and saw the whole city go mad. “I couldn’t get home and I couldn’t get to work the next day either.” He went on to take French and German at Keble College, Oxford, specialising in 17th century French theatre. “Learning languages opens up your eyes to other parts of the world,” he says. “I just wanted to keep on going.”\u0026nbspWhich explains why, a couple of months after graduating, he took a job teaching English in a high school in a town, Hengshui (“not scenic, but with wonderful people”), three hours south of Beijing. With practically no knowledge of Chinese. He just threw himself in at the deep end and found he could float. When he got back to England he switched to international management and Chinese for his masters at Soas (the School of Oriental and African Studies), London. \u0026nbspNivern joined forces with fellow student Ed Holroyd Pearce (who had studied Oriental languages at Cambridge) to set up not just one but two companies, China Recruitment and China Consulting. “The simple idea was to make it easier for people to do what we did.” Those two eventually fused into one, CRCC Asia. They arrange the jobs (across a range of sectors), travel, accommodation and visas, and do all the networking for you. From small beginnings in Nivern’s kitchen in 2006, they now have a team of 50 working out of offices across Asia, collaborating with companies large and small. Nivern is based in Philadelphia, where he has set up partnerships with American universities like Texas and Michigan. And they are now expanding into South Korea, Japan and Vietnam. \u0026nbspI would love to say I get it right all the time. But the Chinese are incredibly receptive to foreigners trying to speak ChineseThis year they expect to send some 1,500 college students and graduates (generally between 18 and 23) to internships in Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, Ho Chi Minh City and… Manchester (it works in reverse too). Forty per cent\u0026nbspwill come from the UK, 40 per cent\u0026nbspfrom the US, and others from New Zealand and Australia. And CRCC Asia are providing a number of scholarships to support people can’t afford to self-finance. There is funding for 250 places\u0026nbspby the British Council. Globalism – combined with Brexit – is persuading a lot of young people to look east in search of work experience and an enhanced CV.\u0026nbspNivern picked up the Mandarin language relatively late. “I would love to say I get it right all the time. But the Chinese are incredibly receptive to foreigners trying to speak Chinese.” He reckons that the grammar is not as difficult as German, “what’s tricky is the tonality.” The same syllable, “Ma”, can mean either “mother” or “horse” (and a few other things), depending. “Hopefully the context helps,” says Nivern. A sentence involving a mother riding a horse is a well-known tongue twister. Most people, like Nivern himself, go to China with no Chinese, “but we encourage everyone to try – it makes a huge difference”.\u0026nbspChina bans actors and films from Asian awards ceremony in TaiwanChina warns Hong Kong protesters as police amass near borderAsian stocks fall as China hits back at US claim of yuan manipulationNivern says that China is like an onion: “You can go on peeling off layers. You think you know it but you don’t.” In CRCC Asia’s “Career Bridge” programme (which gives you training in “intercultural fluency”), one of the key concepts they try to get across to those new to China is mianzi or “face”. You can give face and you can lose face. Nobody wants to lose it. You have to be sensitive to hierarchy in China. If you’re arranging a dinner party, you put the least senior person closest to the door. Conversation should be addressed to the most senior person (like a government official) to begin with. If there is a toast, you can clink glasses, but you have to make sure the rim of your glass is lower than the local bigwig’s glass, otherwise you risk giving offence. By going lower you are giving face. “There’s sometimes a battle as to who goes lower,” says Nivern. “You can end up on the floor.”\u0026nbspJust as Nivern was inspired by the 1998 World Cup, so too, 10 years later, the Beijing Olympics of 2008 gave CRCC Asia a significant boost. The Chinese government took the games seriously enough to close factories and pull vehicles off the road with a view to cutting pollution. “It was all perfectly choreographed. You could say regimented. The closing ceremony was fantastic too.”\u0026nbspApparently the thing that shocked his Chinese friends most was the sight of then mayor of London, Boris Johnson, leading our 2012 handover, looking scruffy, with his jacket unbuttoned, one hand in his pocket, and his shirt hanging half out. He showed a lack of respect and lost a lot of face that day. “But at least I managed to get into the stadium this time,” said Nivern. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ataer\u0026nbspnow has exclusive rights to look into Britain’s second-largest steelmaker in greater detail over the next two months as part of due diligence.\u0026nbsp“During the exclusivity period, close negotiations will be held with customers, suppliers and employees who will play an important role in the future success of British Steel,” Oyak said.If due diligence is finalised\u0026nbspsuccessfully in October, the transfer of the company will be completed by the end of this year, it added.The official receiver for British Steel said: “I have now received an acceptable offer from\u0026nbspAtaer\u0026nbspHoldings AS for the purchase of the whole\u0026nbspbusiness and\u0026nbspI am now focusing on\u0026nbspfinalising\u0026nbspthe sale.“I will be looking to conclude this process in the coming weeks, during which time British Steel continues to trade and supply its customers as normal.”The deal will throw a lifeline to the steelmaker’s 5,000 workers, most of them in the UK, and another 20,000 people employed in its supply chain.It was put into compulsory liquidation after a breakdown in talks between the government and British Steel’s owner\u0026nbspGreybull Capital,\u0026nbspwhich bought the company for £1 just weeks before the EU referendum in 2016.The government had lent British Steel £120m\u0026nbspbut Greybull asked for more to deal with “Brexit-related” issues. However, the then business secretary Greg Clark said there remained no legal options to provide further financial support. Insolvency experts called the company’s collapse “the first heavyweight casualty of\u0026nbspBrexit”.British Steel had\u0026nbspbeen struggling with falling orders from EU customers, which it said were\u0026nbsplinked to uncertainty around tariffs on steel after Brexit. ​Steelmakers had\u0026nbspalso been damaged by a weak pound that had\u0026nbsppushed up the cost of raw materials and a flood of cheap imports from China.Business secretary Andrea Leadsom\u0026nbspwelcomed the provisional deal, saying it was an important step in saving British Steel.Trade union Unite said the news was a relief but added that the government must still help British Steel and the wider UK steel industry tackle high energy costs and business rates.\u0026nbsp“It is also essential that the government acts to prevent a disastrous no-deal Brexit which would lead to cheap steel being dumped in the UK market,” said Harish Patel, the union’s national officer for steel.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was higher than a year ago, the 1.2 per cent annual rise still lagged inflation, which is running at 2.1 per cent according to the latest official data.“There is little doubt that the market continues to face its inevitable challenges,” said Glynis Frew, chief executive of Hunters, an estate agency with over 200 branches across Britain.Official data showed last week that the average price at which homes are sold grew only 0.9 per cent in the year to June, while in London it tumbled by 2.7 per cent. The average British home cost £230,292 in June, down from a peak of £232,000 in August 2018.Buyers have been biding their time as it remains unclear whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal. In the latter case, house prices could plunge by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021, according to forecasts by the government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.However, the more confident buyers are now abandoning the ‘wait and see’ approach and taking advantage of improved housing affordability as the Brexit deadline nears, Ms Frew said, commenting on Rightmove’s findings.For its latest report, Rightmove measured 130,435 asking prices, covering around 90 per cent of the UK market. The properties were put on sale by estate agents between 7 July to 10 August and advertised on rightmove.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The predicament of the young prince, Segismundo, calls to mind the Chinese sage\u0027s story of the man who dreams he is a butterfly and wakes to wonder whether he is actually a butterfly dreaming he is a man. This youth is at the mercy of political fluctuation: he\u0027s been imprisoned in a dark tower from birth because of a horoscope that predicted he would usurp the throne. Then, when there are anxieties about the succession, his father has him drugged, brought to the Palace, and bafflingly treated like a prince. A poetic piece that tackles deep metaphysical, political matters in a dazzlingly theatrical way. PTA play of astonishing breakthroughs. There had been plenty of soliloquies in Elizabethan drama beforehand. But no-one had ever talked to an audience like Hamlet. He doesn\u0027t just let you into his confidence, he lets you into his consciousness the best portrayals make you feel that you are soul-to-soul with this figure. It\u0027s his capacity for searching introspection that gets in the way and disqualifies Hamlet as a revenge hero: he\u0027s rather wonderfully miscast. Hamlet is brilliantly self-reflexive, constantly probing its own theatricality. The conscience of Claudius is tested by a play-within-a play Hamlet tries to fool the court by assuming an “antic disposition” that may at times waver into authentic madness. The piece is like a painful meditation on the contradicting meanings of the verb to “act” – to feign and to intervene. Inexhaustible. PTFeminism and expressionism collide in US playwright Sophie Treadwell\u0027s extraordinary vision of a mechanised, dehumanising metropolis. We feel the nerve-shredding racket of modern existence – described as “this purgatory of noise” – assaulting the Everywoman character at every stage as she makes her descent to doom. She\u0027s a stenographer, a sensitive cog in the machine who is blackmailed by her mother into marriage with a boss who revolts her, and ends up condemned to the electric chair for murdering him. Treadwell\u0027s nagging dialogue, with its jangly staccato and syncopated telegraphese, uncannily anticipates Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Her cry against institutionalised misogyny – “I will not submit” – resounds down the ages. PTIn Gogol\u0027s great phantasmagoric farce, an impecunious clerk newly arrived from St Petersburg is mistakenly assumed to be the eponymous inspector by the corrupt mayor and officials of this provincial town. Panic drives these paranoid locals to project a false identity onto this stranger. That would have been a good enough joke. Gogol, though, gives it an inspired, twist. His penniless nonenity turns out to be driven by an equivalent dread of being recognised as one of life\u0027s losers. So when he twigs to their exploitable mistake, he treats their absurd respect (not to mention their bribes) as long-overdue recognition of his true worth and becomes airborne with grandiosity. It\u0027s the interlocking lunacies that generate the comic delirium in this Russian masterpiece. PTOne of Pinter\u0027s most haunting and unnerving pieces. A married couple, Kate and Deeley, play games of power and possessiveness with the wife\u0027s former flatmate, Anna, who comes to visit for the first time in 20 years. The piece is horribly preoccupied with the use people make of selective – and conceivably invented – memories as weapon or way of gaining the upper hand. We mint memories, in this understanding of it, in response to the psychological needs of the moment: “There are things I remember which may never have happened, but as I recall them.” Deeley is threatened by Anna\u0027s youthful relationship to his wife and strongly attracted to the newcomer. There’s a wonderful evocation of rackety London when the girls lived as secretaries, but the uneasy comedy of all this turns lethal. PTThe best Jacobean tragedy outside Shakespeare, The Changeling also seems to anticipate film noir. The heroine hires a shady type to bump off her fiance. This villain has a facial disfigurement, but the piece is alert to how perversely attracted we are to what repels us. The assassin demands her virginity as his blood-money and the slide into shadowy corruption becomes inexorable. There is a subplot in a madhouse that is designed as a distorted mirror of the main action in its obsession with disguise, lunacy, and sex. PTThis Pulitzer-winning American playwright explores the history of her great-grandmother in early 20th century New York. Esther is a black seamstress – unmarried and illiterate – who sews ravishingly beautiful garments for other women to wear on their wedding nights. She gets what could be a last chance of happiness but it\u0027s destroyed in circumstances that are never sentimentalised. The sensual feel of fine fabric (her means of supporting and expressing herself) is conveyed with gorgeous descriptive power. Intimate Apparel manages to be uplifting without ever losing its irreverent humour. PTSophocles\u0027s play is still the most powerful ever written about the conflict between our obligations to the state and our duty to the ties of kinship. Antigone defies her uncle Kreon, the new ruler of Thebes, by burying her brother Polyneikes. He had brought an army against his native city and Kreon, in these politically volatile times, wants his corpse left for the dogs as an exemplary desecration. The philosopher Hegel saw this as the quintessence of true tragedy: not a conflict between good and evil, but between right and right. In fact, productions nowadays tend to come down in favour of Antigone and her self-sacrificing intransigence. PTRichard Bean had the inspired idea of transposing Goldoni\u0027s 18th century commedia dell\u0027arte romp from Venice to Brighton in 1963. Our jack-the-lad hero – frantically trying to hold down a pair of jobs, unbeknownst to either boss – is a failed skiffle player. The complications are deliciously warped. One character does a bunk to Brighton disguised as her psychotic twin brother who has been bumped off by her posh twit of a boyfriend in a gangland brawl. Still with me? The dialogue is naughty and knowing, but there\u0027s a terrific innocent joy to the physical clowning which peaks in the delirious sequence where our hero has to dish up lunch to the two masters at the same time. PTA supreme example of how a writer can make a play by putting together a triptych of miniatures. Holman was brought up in the pacifist tradition and Making Noise Quietly looks at the long-range effects of war in three chance encounters. In the first, set in a Kent field in 1943, a northern Quaker and an uninhibited London aesthete discuss their reasons for not fighting. In the second, a naval officer arrives to tell a mother of her son’s death in the Falklands War. The third is set in the Black Forest in 1986. An English private, gone AWOL with his disturbed eight-year-old stepson, come into testing collision with a rich German businesswoman who survived the Holocaust. There\u0027s a stunning scene in which she draws the little boy out of his dogmatic mutism by her repeated, stern insistence that he says “thank you” it\u0027s uplifing in the end but it\u0027s not pretty. Writing of rare sensitivity and cumulative power. PTThough he described it as “the lightest of light comedies”, Private Lives is the Noel Coward play that one would undoubtedly preserve for posterity. He wrote it as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, with indecent speed. The play centres on two orcees who, five years after their split, bump into each other on adjacent hotel balconies while on the first night of honeymoons with their new spouses. An elegantly contrived coincidence followed by a pattern of cheekily reversed expectations: most comedies end in marriage this one begins with nobbled nuptials as the couple unceremoniously ditch their second partners and abscond to Paris together. Elyot and Amanda are the kind of flighty egotistical couple that can neither live together nor apart. Anti-romantic comedy soaked in sex (and romance): “Don\u0027t quibble Sybil.” PT1240 Angels in America (1990-93), Tony KushnerSubtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes”, Tony Kushner\u0027s astonishing two-part play is set in the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s during the right wing administration of Ronald Reagan. The word AIDS was never mentioned by the President, and the struggle to find a cure was hampered by a lack of government recognition. Kushner retaliated by putting gay men centre stage in an epic that shows them fighting to forge their private and public destinies. This is, however, very far from a conventional “issue” play in its glorious ambition. The piece rages from Antarctica and the damaged ozone layer to a baroque heaven that god has abandoned. Prophetic angels crash through ceilings. There are “mutual dream” sequences where people wander in and out of each other\u0027 fantasies. The presiding demon of the piece is one of drama\u0027s greatest monsters: the incorrigible and shameless Roy Cohn was a real-life Republican fixer (and mentor to the young Donald Trump). PTA middle-aged woman is buried in a mound of earth first up to the waist then, after the interval, up to the neck. It is a sight that has never lost its capacity to startle. Beckett\u0027s Winnie prattles away dogged with optimism (“This will have been another happy day”) in a loquacious attempt to stave off hysteria and despair at her encroaching fate. Partly irritating, partly heroic, she brings forth a dotty lyrical monologue that\u0027s threaded with genteel half-remembered wisps from the “immortal” classics. Peter Hall, who directed Peggy Ashcroft in the part, rightly pointed out that “Beckett\u0027s theatre is as much about mime and physical precision as it is about words”. Except that his texts are great and this one is superb beyond belief. To quote Winnie: “What is that unforgettable line?” PT1440  Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940), Eugene O NeillWhen O\u0027Neill described Long Day\u0027s Journey as a “play of old sorrow, written in blood and tears”, he was barely exaggerating. This enormous autobiographical drama is so raw and unremitting in its revelations about his dysfunctional Irish-Catholic family that the author left instructions – mercifully disobeyed by his widow – that the play was not to be performed until 25 years after his death. You can understand the trepidation. Long Day\u0027s Journey plunges deep into the tortured heart of the Tyrones – James, the acclaimed actor who sold out to commercial success, his wife Mary who has recently relapsed into morphine addiction, and their two sons. When the play is under the baton of the right director, it\u0027s the like listening to the recapitulations in a great piece of music. You emerge drained but in a state of elating catharsis. PTHector wants to teach boys knowledge that will last them a lifetime. But the headmaster has become obsessed with government league tables and has hired Irwin to teach them glib, exam-passing techniques. That\u0027s the clash at the heart of Alan Bennett\u0027s hugely popular hit. It\u0027s set at a Yorkshire grammar amongst a group of clever sixth-formers. As with a lot of Bennett\u0027s work you can discern a revue-like structure in the play\u0027s glorious string of skits, gags, songs and sheer elating silliness. But it\u0027s also a brilliant portrait of a maverick teacher. The scene in which the doomed Hector analyses the Hardy poem “Drummer Hodge” with his pupil Posner is unsurpassed in drama as an example of humane teaching. Gay, unhappy Posner also has the play\u0027s best joke: “I\u0027m a Jew. I\u0027m small. I\u0027m homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I\u0027m fucked.” PTFrank Hardy, an itinerant Irish faith healer, his wife, and his manager tell four monologues that contradict each other, leaving the audience to question truth and memory, lies and storytelling. Frank struggles to understand his own “gift”, and how his ability to cure comes and goes Faith Healer is also a parable about the artist and his inspiration. The play foundered when it opened on Broadway, but has since been recognised as a modern classic: in a good production, there’s a trembling sort of power to it. Friel’s writing can be rhythmical, incantatory, but it’s also gorgeously subtle. Although Friel throughout maintains a – crucial – ambivalence, the play attains a sort of transcendent grace of its own. HWPlays by this American writer tend to be long, slow – and strangely riveting. It’s hard to pin down what exactly makes John so bewitching. It is set in a kitschy, tat-filled Gettysburg guesthouse, where a fighting young couple interact with the dotty landlady and her blind but visionary friend. The house seems haunted: creepy dolls and pianos start playing themselves. But it’s also haunted by history (it was a civil war hospital), and by the older women’s memories of love, ghosts, and their own mystical experiences. All of this is a little spooky, but also rather emotionally stirring. Baker is also super sharp on the millennial couple’s dying relationship, which opens out into a look at how it’s often women who have to prop up men’s myths, to feed their needy hunger. HWFrom “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers” to “Stellaaaaaa”, Williams’s play has entered the popular consciousness. As well it might: there’s something eternal in its themes of loss, ageing, and the lies we live by. Fear and lust rub up against each other, sweatily few other writers have captured the heat of the South like Williams, and this is the playwright at his most atmospheric. Blanche DuBois – the deluded southern belle who shacks up with her sister and her macho, abusive husband – is a summit part for an actress, and everyone from Vivien Leigh to Tallulah Bankhead, Cate Blanchett to Gillian Anderson have had a go. HWThe only surviving full trilogy of Greek tragedies, through Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides Aeschylus traces the impact of violence and revenge down a Royal family, throwing questions of justice and duty into sharp relief. To win the Trojan war, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter the trilogy opens with a play in which his wife Clytemnestra kills him to avenge her daughter’s death. In Libation Bearers, Clytemnestra’s son Orestes murders her in retaliation (if Antigone is a tragedy because it’s a conflict between right and right, this is perhaps a clash between wrong and wrong). The cycle is broken in Eumenides, where the gods form a court in which to try Orestes. It’s juicy, meaty, high-octane stuff – and has been given era-defining productions both in Peter Hall masked version at the National in 1981, and in Robert Icke’s crisp modern adaptation in 2015. HWPart of the playwright’s cycle exploring the African-American experience in 20th century American –  a play for each decade – this chapter is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927. Ma Rainey, the “mother of the blues”, is slow to show up to record some tunes. Instead, we watch her band kill time and spar with one another. Although it all lands light as a butterfly, the script is stinging on subjects such as ambition and race relations. Ma Rainey, when she arrives, proves worth waiting for: an immense, haughty presence. There’s a twist towards the end, giving the play punch – plus the tunes are great, of course. HWIbsen wrote great women: we could have gone for Hedda Gabler. But A Doll’s House is one of those plays with a wide significance: written in 1879, it’s a proto-feminist text. When our troubled heroine Nora slams the door at the end of the play, it’s not just on her patronising husband, but on the whole of The Patriarchy. The play shocked some in its portrayal of a woman made so desperate by her suffocating domestic situation that she abandons her children as well as her husband, choosing freedom and self-actualistion over the prison of the home. Of course, things have changed for women since, but this exceptionally controlled play still unfolds perfectly – and that slam still resonates. HWYou could make a case for any of Chekhov’s plays really (we nearly went for his early, entertaining Platonov, just to be different) but the lucidity of The Seagull wins out. It’s got more plot, a sliver less ennui, than some of his others: a young man, Konstantin, longs to be a playwright his narcissistic mother Arkadina – an actress – is wrapped up in her new boyfriend, Trigorin, a successful novelist. He in turn romances Nina, Konstantin’s girlfriend and an aspiring actress. It’s not much of a spoiler to say none of their dreams exactly come true, life proving endlessly, exquisitely disappointing. The Seagull is a mordant comedy – scenes skewering both Arkadina’s monstrous ego and her son’s attempts at avant garde art are some of the best bits of theatre-about-theatre ever. But there’s also an unbearable tenderness to the play’s portrayal of young love, hope, and idealism. HW2340  Mother Courage and Her Children (1939), Bertolt Brecht Few, if any, playwrights of the 20th century had as much of an impact on theatre as Brecht: he wanted art to be a political tool rather than escapist entertainment, but also revolutionised theatrical form and style, doing away with naturalism. But it can mean his “epic theatre” is still associated with didacticism, rather than drama. Not so Mother Courage, though, which is epic in both senses: written after Hitler invaded Poland, but set during the Thirty-Years\u0027 War, it is a potent story of one mother’s attempts to profit from conflict, and the huge cost war always takes in the end. HWBased on the Greek myth where Medea kills her children in order to get revenge on her unfaithful husband, this tragedy has lost none of its force – or power to shock. But the text allows more sympathetic readings Medea too, as a woman fighting for justice in an unjust world. With a monumental lead part, and a chorus who react and comment on the action, the play has always been one of the most popular of the Greek tragedies. Taut and tense, you see the horror coming but feel desperately compelled to look. HWThe mother of a murdered child. Her imprisoned paedophile killer. A criminal psychologist attempting to understand what drove him to do it. Through first monologues, and then dialogue, this modem classic has much to say about the extremes of human anguish, but also our capacity for change, and for forgiveness. It’s a dark and thorny work, but a deeply humane one too, by a prolific British writer at her best. HW2640 The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), Oscar Wilde Has there every been such a reliably delightful comedy? The improbable plot of tangled engagements, lost handbags, invented wicked relatives, and real monstrous aunts runs like clockwork. There are innumerable blissful one-liners, the characters are delicious upper-class twits, and at every turn Wilde has a fine old time pricking societal niceties. It’s frothy fun, and funny froth, and always invites larger-than-life performances. Being so very bankable has led to Wilde’s play certainly being over-staged and it now feels thoroughly un-urgent – and then it makes you laugh all over again. HWSherman’s harrowing play pulls the rug from under you. You invest in the relationship between Max and Rudy, a decadent gay couple in Berlin in 1934 – but after the Night of the Long Knives they flee, before being caught and sent to Dachau. On the way, Max’s desire to survive produces sickening betrayal. He pretends to be Jewish rather than gay, but in the camp meets Horst, a man who reveals the honour in being true to one’s self. There’s an astonishing scene where – forbidden to touch – they have sex purely through words. Ian McKellen originally played Max, but Richard Gere and Alan Cummings have also taken on the role in what is now seen as seminal gay text – one that proves truth and love may flower in the most horrific, hopeless circumstances. HWAh, the transformative power of theatre… This familiar idea is irresistibly proven by Wertenbaker’s oft-revived play, based on a true story about a group of convicts in an Australian penal colony who put on a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer. It has fun sending up the pretensions of theatre, but ultimately uses it as means for talking about empathy, communication, and understanding, as relations between the reviled prisoners and the cruel officers thaw. A direct piece of storytelling with a huge heart. HWLucy Prebble made her name with ENRON, charting the hubris of the financial giant, but while it may be less flashy, The Effect is still dazzlingly good. It has, at its heart, a question we’d all like to know the answer to: what is love? The play follows two volunteers in a clinical trial for a new anti-depressant when they fall for each other, they wonder whether their love is “real”, or a by-product. And given all interactions in the brain are just chemical, does it even matter? The idea of what’s really real and what’s really romantic, what happiness is and what function unhappiness might have, are turned over by Prebble’s own very sharp mind. Her characters are fun to spend time with, her dialogue is snappy, but she digs deep too, into both scientific theories and human emotions, taking us from the grey lows of depression to the technicolour highs of new love. HWIt can be hard to separate this play from an animating original performance by the great Mark Rylance, who played Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a wild misfit who lives in a caravan in the woods in rural England, gathering local young people to him like some kind of drink-and-drug-fuelled pied piper. Such a summary might sound tawdry, yet set on St George’s Day and ripe with Rooster’s storytelling, it has a mythic, mystical quality. A state-of-the-nation show powered by anti-establishment brio, it also precisely captures a contemporary rural community (very sweary, and very funny). Jerusalem became a ridiculously big hit, with audiences camping out round the theatre for tickets. But a recent revival suggests the play can still crow, whoever plays Rooster. HWWhat makes a great play? A lot of critics, academics, and playwrights themselves will point to form matching content. On this, Tim Crouch’s glitteringly clever play really delivers – while also being extremely moving. A stage hypnotist encounters the father of a girl he killed in a car accident. The father truly believes his daughter has been transformed into oak tree. At every performance, the father is played by an actor who’s never seen or read the play before they are given a script or fed lines by – yes – the hypnotist (played initially by Crouch himself, also acknowledging his “real” role as the playwright). The actor is transformed before us we accept that they are now the father. An Oak Tree has a radical honesty which has made it hugely influential among younger generation. We always know theatre isn’t “real” – by playfully acknowledging that, the emotional impact is actually heightened. It’s a magic trick where understanding the trickery only makes the magic more real. HWAthol Fugard came to see that the righteous anger of didactic anti-apartheid drama was not as effective as the subversive laughter of the black townships when it came to getting across the harshness of the conditions there. Certainly, there is nothing moralising or solemn about this piece which was developed by Fugard from improvisations with the great John Kani and Winston Ntosha who first performed it. A mischievous shaggy dog story, it pulls the audience into an atmosphere of good-humoured sociability. Sizwe is a work-seeker in Port Elizabeth who can\u0027t get a job because he doesn\u0027t have a permit. It turns out that he has found a dead man\u0027s pass book and has substituted his own photo, killing off Sizwe Bansi. A deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era. PT3340 Purgatory in Ingolstadt (1924)  Pioneers in Ingolstadt (1928), Marieluise FleisserMarieluise Fleisser, the author of these sorely neglected plays, was the lover, protégée, and victim of Bertolt Brecht, and her subject was the lower Bavarian city of her birth. The plays use a bold collage technique instead of linear narrative, and she had penetrating insights into its vicious pack mentality and conformist claustrophobia. In Purgatory, she evokes a stifling Catholic ethos: we see two very different rebels (one girl seeks in vain for an abortion) who suffer the humiliation of having to crawl back to the pack. Brecht effectively hijacked her second play Pioneers (about the contact between the inhabitants and a visiting squad of bridge-builders). He imposed overt anti-militarism and sensationalising sex, and Fleisser was denounced as a traitor to German womanhood. Stephen Daldry and Annie Castledine directed a superb version of these plays at the tiny Gate Theatre in 1991. Since when, nothing. It\u0027s high time Fleisser was given her due. PTTempting as it is to include Michael Frayn’s sublimely funny backstage farce, Noises Off, the more serious Copenhagen just pips it. It imagines a real meeting between nuclear physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and German Werner Heisenberg, in Copenhagen in 1941, to discuss developments that will lead to the atomic bomb. Then he reimagines the meeting, and reimagines it again – after all, no-one really knows what happened. Was Heisenberg warning his old friend of the Nazis’ advances in nuclear weapons? Hoping for a mutual pact to prevent the atomic bomb? Seeking absolution? Looking at the unreliability of memory, the structure of Frayn’s play is cleverly animated by the scientific ideas his characters discuss: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the basis for its dramatic form. A big hit when it opened at the National, it went to the West End, Broadway – and wound up on TV, starring Daniel Craig. HWThis play was a theatrical explosion. Sarah Kane’s debut, written while she was a student, features a nasty tabloid journalist holed up in a Leeds hotel with a much younger woman, whom he sexually abuses. The world of the play – and its conventional theatrical form – is then blasted apart becoming a war zone: a soldier bursts in, explosions go off, and short scenes of grim horror unfold (stage directions include “he eats the baby”). Famously described as a “disgusting feast of filth”, Blasted was seen by critics as a puerile attempt to shock, and anointed as the classic example of provocative, Nineties in-yer-face theatre. But it’s since become canonical. It doesn’t seem to grow old: Kane’s writing has a horribly vivid energy, and the atrocities it depicts, depressingly, take on fresh resonance for each generation that discovers it. HWWho committed the first infidelity? Was it a man, or was it a woman? (You can bet it was a man who first thought of this prurient question.) The court in Marivaux\u0027s dark comedy thinks it has created the right laboratory conditions for finding out the answer. Four teenagers have been brought up in complete solitude and then are released into each other\u0027s company where their encounters will furnish “a most original entertainment” for the unseen Prince and his fiancée. The play incisively shows how easy it is to turn a stage into an experimental blank slate. But it feels a bit pervy – the Enlightenment\u0027s idea of reality television. Marivaux is elegantly conscious of the objections. There are razor blades secreted in the rococo décor of his works. PTIt\u0027s easy to make Pirandello sound like a forbiddingly cerebral writer. All his life he played tricksy games with philosophical problems such as the deceptiveness of identity. But his aim was to “to convert intellect into passion” and his best works succeed in doing so. Henry IV is about madness, the appearance of madness, and the consequence of deciding to become trapped within the appearance of madness. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman who falls from his horse at a pageant and comes round, convinced that he\u0027s the medieval German Emperor. For 20 years, he has been allowed to live this illusion, attended by flunkies in period-costume. But now comes an embassy bent on “shocking” him from this idee fixe. Richard Harris and Ian McDiarmid were the last pair to play Henry in the West End and they relished the chance to interweave the quizzicality and raw pain that the part requires. The predicament of the central character feels more tragicomically stimulating than far-fetched. PT3840 A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine HansberryThis play made history: the first on Broadway written by a black woman (shamefully, Britain wouldn’t have its equivalent – a play in the West End by a black British woman – until last year, with Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night). A Raisin in the Sun looks at the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty in Chicago, dreaming of a better life – and fearing that their dreams will shrivel up like “a raisin in the sun”. Hansberry’s aching drama exhibits the same forceful tug as an Arthur Miller play, laying out how circumstances can crush hope. Its discussion of black identity, however, still crackles today – and the emotional punch that Hansberry’s script carries has drawn big names down the decade: Sidney Poitier starred in the premiere, and everyone from Denzel Washington to P Diddy has also had a crack. Hansberry died at only 34 one can’t help but wonder what other plays she might have had on this list. HWCaryl Churchill has been called the Picasso of modern playwrights. Today, at the age of 80, the British playwright continues startlingly to reinvent herself. Far Away is a twisted fairy tale that demonstrates her matchless gift for merging the apocalyptic and the fantastical. It unfolds in three episodes that shelve steeply. In the first, Joan is quizzing her aunt about what she has just accidentally witnessed. It sounds as if she has espied a bloody act of ethnic cleansing. Then the play escalates into a blackly hilarious vision of cosmic warfare. Partisan brutality has now spread from humans to the animal and mineral world. “The cats have come in on the side of the French,” someone says earnestly. The “natural goodness of deer has come through” says someone else. This is characteristic of Churchill, finding a brilliantly absurdist way of attacking the pernicious myth that there is a simple ide between virtue and evil, “them” and “us”. A sliver of genius. PTTom Stoppard sometimes gets accused of being all head and no heart – but this play proves otherwise. Yes, it’s a mind-achingly clever look at both science and art, pitting the rational against the romantic, while giving you mini lessons in chaos theory, the second law of thermodynamics and the life and shaggings of Lord Byron. But there’s a love story and a tragedy here, that in a well-calibrated production can be very moving. Two stories, set in the same country house, in 1809 and the present day, intersect and eventually overlap beautifully. The mathematic theorising forecasts hope as well as disaster for the universe, and the story offers the same for its characters. HWCalderon\u0027s play is one of the masterpieces of the Spanish Golden Age. The predicament of the young prince, Segismundo, calls to mind the Chinese sage\u0027s story of the man who dreams he is a butterfly and wakes to wonder whether he is actually a butterfly dreaming he is a man. This youth is at the mercy of political fluctuation: he\u0027s been imprisoned in a dark tower from birth because of a horoscope that predicted he would usurp the throne. Then, when there are anxieties about the succession, his father has him drugged, brought to the Palace, and bafflingly treated like a prince. A poetic piece that tackles deep metaphysical, political matters in a dazzlingly theatrical way. PTA play of astonishing breakthroughs. There had been plenty of soliloquies in Elizabethan drama beforehand. But no-one had ever talked to an audience like Hamlet. He doesn\u0027t just let you into his confidence, he lets you into his consciousness the best portrayals make you feel that you are soul-to-soul with this figure. It\u0027s his capacity for searching introspection that gets in the way and disqualifies Hamlet as a revenge hero: he\u0027s rather wonderfully miscast. Hamlet is brilliantly self-reflexive, constantly probing its own theatricality. The conscience of Claudius is tested by a play-within-a play Hamlet tries to fool the court by assuming an “antic disposition” that may at times waver into authentic madness. The piece is like a painful meditation on the contradicting meanings of the verb to “act” – to feign and to intervene. Inexhaustible. PTFeminism and expressionism collide in US playwright Sophie Treadwell\u0027s extraordinary vision of a mechanised, dehumanising metropolis. We feel the nerve-shredding racket of modern existence – described as “this purgatory of noise” – assaulting the Everywoman character at every stage as she makes her descent to doom. She\u0027s a stenographer, a sensitive cog in the machine who is blackmailed by her mother into marriage with a boss who revolts her, and ends up condemned to the electric chair for murdering him. Treadwell\u0027s nagging dialogue, with its jangly staccato and syncopated telegraphese, uncannily anticipates Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Her cry against institutionalised misogyny – “I will not submit” – resounds down the ages. PTIn Gogol\u0027s great phantasmagoric farce, an impecunious clerk newly arrived from St Petersburg is mistakenly assumed to be the eponymous inspector by the corrupt mayor and officials of this provincial town. Panic drives these paranoid locals to project a false identity onto this stranger. That would have been a good enough joke. Gogol, though, gives it an inspired, twist. His penniless nonenity turns out to be driven by an equivalent dread of being recognised as one of life\u0027s losers. So when he twigs to their exploitable mistake, he treats their absurd respect (not to mention their bribes) as long-overdue recognition of his true worth and becomes airborne with grandiosity. It\u0027s the interlocking lunacies that generate the comic delirium in this Russian masterpiece. PTOne of Pinter\u0027s most haunting and unnerving pieces. A married couple, Kate and Deeley, play games of power and possessiveness with the wife\u0027s former flatmate, Anna, who comes to visit for the first time in 20 years. The piece is horribly preoccupied with the use people make of selective – and conceivably invented – memories as weapon or way of gaining the upper hand. We mint memories, in this understanding of it, in response to the psychological needs of the moment: “There are things I remember which may never have happened, but as I recall them.” Deeley is threatened by Anna\u0027s youthful relationship to his wife and strongly attracted to the newcomer. There’s a wonderful evocation of rackety London when the girls lived as secretaries, but the uneasy comedy of all this turns lethal. PTThe best Jacobean tragedy outside Shakespeare, The Changeling also seems to anticipate film noir. The heroine hires a shady type to bump off her fiance. This villain has a facial disfigurement, but the piece is alert to how perversely attracted we are to what repels us. The assassin demands her virginity as his blood-money and the slide into shadowy corruption becomes inexorable. There is a subplot in a madhouse that is designed as a distorted mirror of the main action in its obsession with disguise, lunacy, and sex. PTThis Pulitzer-winning American playwright explores the history of her great-grandmother in early 20th century New York. Esther is a black seamstress – unmarried and illiterate – who sews ravishingly beautiful garments for other women to wear on their wedding nights. She gets what could be a last chance of happiness but it\u0027s destroyed in circumstances that are never sentimentalised. The sensual feel of fine fabric (her means of supporting and expressing herself) is conveyed with gorgeous descriptive power. Intimate Apparel manages to be uplifting without ever losing its irreverent humour. PTSophocles\u0027s play is still the most powerful ever written about the conflict between our obligations to the state and our duty to the ties of kinship. Antigone defies her uncle Kreon, the new ruler of Thebes, by burying her brother Polyneikes. He had brought an army against his native city and Kreon, in these politically volatile times, wants his corpse left for the dogs as an exemplary desecration. The philosopher Hegel saw this as the quintessence of true tragedy: not a conflict between good and evil, but between right and right. In fact, productions nowadays tend to come down in favour of Antigone and her self-sacrificing intransigence. PTRichard Bean had the inspired idea of transposing Goldoni\u0027s 18th century commedia dell\u0027arte romp from Venice to Brighton in 1963. Our jack-the-lad hero – frantically trying to hold down a pair of jobs, unbeknownst to either boss – is a failed skiffle player. The complications are deliciously warped. One character does a bunk to Brighton disguised as her psychotic twin brother who has been bumped off by her posh twit of a boyfriend in a gangland brawl. Still with me? The dialogue is naughty and knowing, but there\u0027s a terrific innocent joy to the physical clowning which peaks in the delirious sequence where our hero has to dish up lunch to the two masters at the same time. PTA supreme example of how a writer can make a play by putting together a triptych of miniatures. Holman was brought up in the pacifist tradition and Making Noise Quietly looks at the long-range effects of war in three chance encounters. In the first, set in a Kent field in 1943, a northern Quaker and an uninhibited London aesthete discuss their reasons for not fighting. In the second, a naval officer arrives to tell a mother of her son’s death in the Falklands War. The third is set in the Black Forest in 1986. An English private, gone AWOL with his disturbed eight-year-old stepson, come into testing collision with a rich German businesswoman who survived the Holocaust. There\u0027s a stunning scene in which she draws the little boy out of his dogmatic mutism by her repeated, stern insistence that he says “thank you” it\u0027s uplifing in the end but it\u0027s not pretty. Writing of rare sensitivity and cumulative power. PTThough he described it as “the lightest of light comedies”, Private Lives is the Noel Coward play that one would undoubtedly preserve for posterity. He wrote it as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, with indecent speed. The play centres on two orcees who, five years after their split, bump into each other on adjacent hotel balconies while on the first night of honeymoons with their new spouses. An elegantly contrived coincidence followed by a pattern of cheekily reversed expectations: most comedies end in marriage this one begins with nobbled nuptials as the couple unceremoniously ditch their second partners and abscond to Paris together. Elyot and Amanda are the kind of flighty egotistical couple that can neither live together nor apart. Anti-romantic comedy soaked in sex (and romance): “Don\u0027t quibble Sybil.” PT1240 Angels in America (1990-93), Tony KushnerSubtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes”, Tony Kushner\u0027s astonishing two-part play is set in the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s during the right wing administration of Ronald Reagan. The word AIDS was never mentioned by the President, and the struggle to find a cure was hampered by a lack of government recognition. Kushner retaliated by putting gay men centre stage in an epic that shows them fighting to forge their private and public destinies. This is, however, very far from a conventional “issue” play in its glorious ambition. The piece rages from Antarctica and the damaged ozone layer to a baroque heaven that god has abandoned. Prophetic angels crash through ceilings. There are “mutual dream” sequences where people wander in and out of each other\u0027 fantasies. The presiding demon of the piece is one of drama\u0027s greatest monsters: the incorrigible and shameless Roy Cohn was a real-life Republican fixer (and mentor to the young Donald Trump). PTA middle-aged woman is buried in a mound of earth first up to the waist then, after the interval, up to the neck. It is a sight that has never lost its capacity to startle. Beckett\u0027s Winnie prattles away dogged with optimism (“This will have been another happy day”) in a loquacious attempt to stave off hysteria and despair at her encroaching fate. Partly irritating, partly heroic, she brings forth a dotty lyrical monologue that\u0027s threaded with genteel half-remembered wisps from the “immortal” classics. Peter Hall, who directed Peggy Ashcroft in the part, rightly pointed out that “Beckett\u0027s theatre is as much about mime and physical precision as it is about words”. Except that his texts are great and this one is superb beyond belief. To quote Winnie: “What is that unforgettable line?” PT1440  Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940), Eugene O NeillWhen O\u0027Neill described Long Day\u0027s Journey as a “play of old sorrow, written in blood and tears”, he was barely exaggerating. This enormous autobiographical drama is so raw and unremitting in its revelations about his dysfunctional Irish-Catholic family that the author left instructions – mercifully disobeyed by his widow – that the play was not to be performed until 25 years after his death. You can understand the trepidation. Long Day\u0027s Journey plunges deep into the tortured heart of the Tyrones – James, the acclaimed actor who sold out to commercial success, his wife Mary who has recently relapsed into morphine addiction, and their two sons. When the play is under the baton of the right director, it\u0027s the like listening to the recapitulations in a great piece of music. You emerge drained but in a state of elating catharsis. PTHector wants to teach boys knowledge that will last them a lifetime. But the headmaster has become obsessed with government league tables and has hired Irwin to teach them glib, exam-passing techniques. That\u0027s the clash at the heart of Alan Bennett\u0027s hugely popular hit. It\u0027s set at a Yorkshire grammar amongst a group of clever sixth-formers. As with a lot of Bennett\u0027s work you can discern a revue-like structure in the play\u0027s glorious string of skits, gags, songs and sheer elating silliness. But it\u0027s also a brilliant portrait of a maverick teacher. The scene in which the doomed Hector analyses the Hardy poem “Drummer Hodge” with his pupil Posner is unsurpassed in drama as an example of humane teaching. Gay, unhappy Posner also has the play\u0027s best joke: “I\u0027m a Jew. I\u0027m small. I\u0027m homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I\u0027m fucked.” PTFrank Hardy, an itinerant Irish faith healer, his wife, and his manager tell four monologues that contradict each other, leaving the audience to question truth and memory, lies and storytelling. Frank struggles to understand his own “gift”, and how his ability to cure comes and goes Faith Healer is also a parable about the artist and his inspiration. The play foundered when it opened on Broadway, but has since been recognised as a modern classic: in a good production, there’s a trembling sort of power to it. Friel’s writing can be rhythmical, incantatory, but it’s also gorgeously subtle. Although Friel throughout maintains a – crucial – ambivalence, the play attains a sort of transcendent grace of its own. HWPlays by this American writer tend to be long, slow – and strangely riveting. It’s hard to pin down what exactly makes John so bewitching. It is set in a kitschy, tat-filled Gettysburg guesthouse, where a fighting young couple interact with the dotty landlady and her blind but visionary friend. The house seems haunted: creepy dolls and pianos start playing themselves. But it’s also haunted by history (it was a civil war hospital), and by the older women’s memories of love, ghosts, and their own mystical experiences. All of this is a little spooky, but also rather emotionally stirring. Baker is also super sharp on the millennial couple’s dying relationship, which opens out into a look at how it’s often women who have to prop up men’s myths, to feed their needy hunger. HWFrom “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers” to “Stellaaaaaa”, Williams’s play has entered the popular consciousness. As well it might: there’s something eternal in its themes of loss, ageing, and the lies we live by. Fear and lust rub up against each other, sweatily few other writers have captured the heat of the South like Williams, and this is the playwright at his most atmospheric. Blanche DuBois – the deluded southern belle who shacks up with her sister and her macho, abusive husband – is a summit part for an actress, and everyone from Vivien Leigh to Tallulah Bankhead, Cate Blanchett to Gillian Anderson have had a go. HWThe only surviving full trilogy of Greek tragedies, through Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides Aeschylus traces the impact of violence and revenge down a Royal family, throwing questions of justice and duty into sharp relief. To win the Trojan war, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter the trilogy opens with a play in which his wife Clytemnestra kills him to avenge her daughter’s death. In Libation Bearers, Clytemnestra’s son Orestes murders her in retaliation (if Antigone is a tragedy because it’s a conflict between right and right, this is perhaps a clash between wrong and wrong). The cycle is broken in Eumenides, where the gods form a court in which to try Orestes. It’s juicy, meaty, high-octane stuff – and has been given era-defining productions both in Peter Hall masked version at the National in 1981, and in Robert Icke’s crisp modern adaptation in 2015. HWPart of the playwright’s cycle exploring the African-American experience in 20th century American –  a play for each decade – this chapter is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927. Ma Rainey, the “mother of the blues”, is slow to show up to record some tunes. Instead, we watch her band kill time and spar with one another. Although it all lands light as a butterfly, the script is stinging on subjects such as ambition and race relations. Ma Rainey, when she arrives, proves worth waiting for: an immense, haughty presence. There’s a twist towards the end, giving the play punch – plus the tunes are great, of course. HWIbsen wrote great women: we could have gone for Hedda Gabler. But A Doll’s House is one of those plays with a wide significance: written in 1879, it’s a proto-feminist text. When our troubled heroine Nora slams the door at the end of the play, it’s not just on her patronising husband, but on the whole of The Patriarchy. The play shocked some in its portrayal of a woman made so desperate by her suffocating domestic situation that she abandons her children as well as her husband, choosing freedom and self-actualistion over the prison of the home. Of course, things have changed for women since, but this exceptionally controlled play still unfolds perfectly – and that slam still resonates. HWYou could make a case for any of Chekhov’s plays really (we nearly went for his early, entertaining Platonov, just to be different) but the lucidity of The Seagull wins out. It’s got more plot, a sliver less ennui, than some of his others: a young man, Konstantin, longs to be a playwright his narcissistic mother Arkadina – an actress – is wrapped up in her new boyfriend, Trigorin, a successful novelist. He in turn romances Nina, Konstantin’s girlfriend and an aspiring actress. It’s not much of a spoiler to say none of their dreams exactly come true, life proving endlessly, exquisitely disappointing. The Seagull is a mordant comedy – scenes skewering both Arkadina’s monstrous ego and her son’s attempts at avant garde art are some of the best bits of theatre-about-theatre ever. But there’s also an unbearable tenderness to the play’s portrayal of young love, hope, and idealism. HW2340  Mother Courage and Her Children (1939), Bertolt Brecht Few, if any, playwrights of the 20th century had as much of an impact on theatre as Brecht: he wanted art to be a political tool rather than escapist entertainment, but also revolutionised theatrical form and style, doing away with naturalism. But it can mean his “epic theatre” is still associated with didacticism, rather than drama. Not so Mother Courage, though, which is epic in both senses: written after Hitler invaded Poland, but set during the Thirty-Years\u0027 War, it is a potent story of one mother’s attempts to profit from conflict, and the huge cost war always takes in the end. HWBased on the Greek myth where Medea kills her children in order to get revenge on her unfaithful husband, this tragedy has lost none of its force – or power to shock. But the text allows more sympathetic readings Medea too, as a woman fighting for justice in an unjust world. With a monumental lead part, and a chorus who react and comment on the action, the play has always been one of the most popular of the Greek tragedies. Taut and tense, you see the horror coming but feel desperately compelled to look. HWThe mother of a murdered child. Her imprisoned paedophile killer. A criminal psychologist attempting to understand what drove him to do it. Through first monologues, and then dialogue, this modem classic has much to say about the extremes of human anguish, but also our capacity for change, and for forgiveness. It’s a dark and thorny work, but a deeply humane one too, by a prolific British writer at her best. HW2640 The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), Oscar Wilde Has there every been such a reliably delightful comedy? The improbable plot of tangled engagements, lost handbags, invented wicked relatives, and real monstrous aunts runs like clockwork. There are innumerable blissful one-liners, the characters are delicious upper-class twits, and at every turn Wilde has a fine old time pricking societal niceties. It’s frothy fun, and funny froth, and always invites larger-than-life performances. Being so very bankable has led to Wilde’s play certainly being over-staged and it now feels thoroughly un-urgent – and then it makes you laugh all over again. HWSherman’s harrowing play pulls the rug from under you. You invest in the relationship between Max and Rudy, a decadent gay couple in Berlin in 1934 – but after the Night of the Long Knives they flee, before being caught and sent to Dachau. On the way, Max’s desire to survive produces sickening betrayal. He pretends to be Jewish rather than gay, but in the camp meets Horst, a man who reveals the honour in being true to one’s self. There’s an astonishing scene where – forbidden to touch – they have sex purely through words. Ian McKellen originally played Max, but Richard Gere and Alan Cummings have also taken on the role in what is now seen as seminal gay text – one that proves truth and love may flower in the most horrific, hopeless circumstances. HWAh, the transformative power of theatre… This familiar idea is irresistibly proven by Wertenbaker’s oft-revived play, based on a true story about a group of convicts in an Australian penal colony who put on a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer. It has fun sending up the pretensions of theatre, but ultimately uses it as means for talking about empathy, communication, and understanding, as relations between the reviled prisoners and the cruel officers thaw. A direct piece of storytelling with a huge heart. HWLucy Prebble made her name with ENRON, charting the hubris of the financial giant, but while it may be less flashy, The Effect is still dazzlingly good. It has, at its heart, a question we’d all like to know the answer to: what is love? The play follows two volunteers in a clinical trial for a new anti-depressant when they fall for each other, they wonder whether their love is “real”, or a by-product. And given all interactions in the brain are just chemical, does it even matter? The idea of what’s really real and what’s really romantic, what happiness is and what function unhappiness might have, are turned over by Prebble’s own very sharp mind. Her characters are fun to spend time with, her dialogue is snappy, but she digs deep too, into both scientific theories and human emotions, taking us from the grey lows of depression to the technicolour highs of new love. HWIt can be hard to separate this play from an animating original performance by the great Mark Rylance, who played Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a wild misfit who lives in a caravan in the woods in rural England, gathering local young people to him like some kind of drink-and-drug-fuelled pied piper. Such a summary might sound tawdry, yet set on St George’s Day and ripe with Rooster’s storytelling, it has a mythic, mystical quality. A state-of-the-nation show powered by anti-establishment brio, it also precisely captures a contemporary rural community (very sweary, and very funny). Jerusalem became a ridiculously big hit, with audiences camping out round the theatre for tickets. But a recent revival suggests the play can still crow, whoever plays Rooster. HWWhat makes a great play? A lot of critics, academics, and playwrights themselves will point to form matching content. On this, Tim Crouch’s glitteringly clever play really delivers – while also being extremely moving. A stage hypnotist encounters the father of a girl he killed in a car accident. The father truly believes his daughter has been transformed into oak tree. At every performance, the father is played by an actor who’s never seen or read the play before they are given a script or fed lines by – yes – the hypnotist (played initially by Crouch himself, also acknowledging his “real” role as the playwright). The actor is transformed before us we accept that they are now the father. An Oak Tree has a radical honesty which has made it hugely influential among younger generation. We always know theatre isn’t “real” – by playfully acknowledging that, the emotional impact is actually heightened. It’s a magic trick where understanding the trickery only makes the magic more real. HWAthol Fugard came to see that the righteous anger of didactic anti-apartheid drama was not as effective as the subversive laughter of the black townships when it came to getting across the harshness of the conditions there. Certainly, there is nothing moralising or solemn about this piece which was developed by Fugard from improvisations with the great John Kani and Winston Ntosha who first performed it. A mischievous shaggy dog story, it pulls the audience into an atmosphere of good-humoured sociability. Sizwe is a work-seeker in Port Elizabeth who can\u0027t get a job because he doesn\u0027t have a permit. It turns out that he has found a dead man\u0027s pass book and has substituted his own photo, killing off Sizwe Bansi. A deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era. PT3340 Purgatory in Ingolstadt (1924)  Pioneers in Ingolstadt (1928), Marieluise FleisserMarieluise Fleisser, the author of these sorely neglected plays, was the lover, protégée, and victim of Bertolt Brecht, and her subject was the lower Bavarian city of her birth. The plays use a bold collage technique instead of linear narrative, and she had penetrating insights into its vicious pack mentality and conformist claustrophobia. In Purgatory, she evokes a stifling Catholic ethos: we see two very different rebels (one girl seeks in vain for an abortion) who suffer the humiliation of having to crawl back to the pack. Brecht effectively hijacked her second play Pioneers (about the contact between the inhabitants and a visiting squad of bridge-builders). He imposed overt anti-militarism and sensationalising sex, and Fleisser was denounced as a traitor to German womanhood. Stephen Daldry and Annie Castledine directed a superb version of these plays at the tiny Gate Theatre in 1991. Since when, nothing. It\u0027s high time Fleisser was given her due. PTTempting as it is to include Michael Frayn’s sublimely funny backstage farce, Noises Off, the more serious Copenhagen just pips it. It imagines a real meeting between nuclear physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and German Werner Heisenberg, in Copenhagen in 1941, to discuss developments that will lead to the atomic bomb. Then he reimagines the meeting, and reimagines it again – after all, no-one really knows what happened. Was Heisenberg warning his old friend of the Nazis’ advances in nuclear weapons? Hoping for a mutual pact to prevent the atomic bomb? Seeking absolution? Looking at the unreliability of memory, the structure of Frayn’s play is cleverly animated by the scientific ideas his characters discuss: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the basis for its dramatic form. A big hit when it opened at the National, it went to the West End, Broadway – and wound up on TV, starring Daniel Craig. HWThis play was a theatrical explosion. Sarah Kane’s debut, written while she was a student, features a nasty tabloid journalist holed up in a Leeds hotel with a much younger woman, whom he sexually abuses. The world of the play – and its conventional theatrical form – is then blasted apart becoming a war zone: a soldier bursts in, explosions go off, and short scenes of grim horror unfold (stage directions include “he eats the baby”). Famously described as a “disgusting feast of filth”, Blasted was seen by critics as a puerile attempt to shock, and anointed as the classic example of provocative, Nineties in-yer-face theatre. But it’s since become canonical. It doesn’t seem to grow old: Kane’s writing has a horribly vivid energy, and the atrocities it depicts, depressingly, take on fresh resonance for each generation that discovers it. HWWho committed the first infidelity? Was it a man, or was it a woman? (You can bet it was a man who first thought of this prurient question.) The court in Marivaux\u0027s dark comedy thinks it has created the right laboratory conditions for finding out the answer. Four teenagers have been brought up in complete solitude and then are released into each other\u0027s company where their encounters will furnish “a most original entertainment” for the unseen Prince and his fiancée. The play incisively shows how easy it is to turn a stage into an experimental blank slate. But it feels a bit pervy – the Enlightenment\u0027s idea of reality television. Marivaux is elegantly conscious of the objections. There are razor blades secreted in the rococo décor of his works. PTIt\u0027s easy to make Pirandello sound like a forbiddingly cerebral writer. All his life he played tricksy games with philosophical problems such as the deceptiveness of identity. But his aim was to “to convert intellect into passion” and his best works succeed in doing so. Henry IV is about madness, the appearance of madness, and the consequence of deciding to become trapped within the appearance of madness. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman who falls from his horse at a pageant and comes round, convinced that he\u0027s the medieval German Emperor. For 20 years, he has been allowed to live this illusion, attended by flunkies in period-costume. But now comes an embassy bent on “shocking” him from this idee fixe. Richard Harris and Ian McDiarmid were the last pair to play Henry in the West End and they relished the chance to interweave the quizzicality and raw pain that the part requires. The predicament of the central character feels more tragicomically stimulating than far-fetched. PT3840 A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine HansberryThis play made history: the first on Broadway written by a black woman (shamefully, Britain wouldn’t have its equivalent – a play in the West End by a black British woman – until last year, with Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night). A Raisin in the Sun looks at the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty in Chicago, dreaming of a better life – and fearing that their dreams will shrivel up like “a raisin in the sun”. Hansberry’s aching drama exhibits the same forceful tug as an Arthur Miller play, laying out how circumstances can crush hope. Its discussion of black identity, however, still crackles today – and the emotional punch that Hansberry’s script carries has drawn big names down the decade: Sidney Poitier starred in the premiere, and everyone from Denzel Washington to P Diddy has also had a crack. Hansberry died at only 34 one can’t help but wonder what other plays she might have had on this list. HWCaryl Churchill has been called the Picasso of modern playwrights. Today, at the age of 80, the British playwright continues startlingly to reinvent herself. Far Away is a twisted fairy tale that demonstrates her matchless gift for merging the apocalyptic and the fantastical. It unfolds in three episodes that shelve steeply. In the first, Joan is quizzing her aunt about what she has just accidentally witnessed. It sounds as if she has espied a bloody act of ethnic cleansing. Then the play escalates into a blackly hilarious vision of cosmic warfare. Partisan brutality has now spread from humans to the animal and mineral world. “The cats have come in on the side of the French,” someone says earnestly. The “natural goodness of deer has come through” says someone else. This is characteristic of Churchill, finding a brilliantly absurdist way of attacking the pernicious myth that there is a simple ide between virtue and evil, “them” and “us”. A sliver of genius. PTTom Stoppard sometimes gets accused of being all head and no heart – but this play proves otherwise. Yes, it’s a mind-achingly clever look at both science and art, pitting the rational against the romantic, while giving you mini lessons in chaos theory, the second law of thermodynamics and the life and shaggings of Lord Byron. But there’s a love story and a tragedy here, that in a well-calibrated production can be very moving. Two stories, set in the same country house, in 1809 and the present day, intersect and eventually overlap beautifully. The mathematic theorising forecasts hope as well as disaster for the universe, and the story offers the same for its characters.

But has the rise and fall and rise again of James Charles turned the tide on influencer culture, asks Sirena Bergman, or shone a light on how much we love watching celebrities fall from grace?Click to followThe IndependentLast month, Time magazine released its list of the 25 most influential people on the internet. Nestled among politicians, royals and activists of household-name status are hugely popular YouTubers many may not have heard of. The endlessly relatable Emma Chamberlain, with over 8 million subscribers, features. As does 16-year-old tween sensation and former Dance Moms star JoJo Siwa, with almost 10 million followers.And then you come to the name James Charles, who up until this spring was relatively unknown to the masses, despite more than 16 million people subscribing to his YouTube channel. Like many influencers, he existed in a curious celebrity middle-ground, where despite being mobbed by thousands of adoring fans, the traditional media pretty much completely ignored him. But all that changed on 10 May, when fellow YouTuber and former friend Tati Westbrook uploaded a 43-minute video which can broadly be described as a character assassination of Charles, kickstarting what would become one of the most talked-about, consequential feuds in influencer history.The making of James CharlesTo understand the monumental cultural impact of the dispute, we must go back to 5 September 2016, when a relatively unknown 17-year-old James Charles Dickinson, who had built up a\u0026nbspmodest following by\u0026nbspfilming make-up tutorials on YouTube for under a year, tweeted his senior yearbook picture. He explained that he’d had the photos retaken with his ringlight\u0026nbsp“so my highlight would be poppin” because he loves “being extra”.\u0026nbspThe photo went viral and racked up more than 33,000 retweets and 84,000 likes on Twitter within just a day, including a retweet from then 20-year-old actor and singer Zendaya. By the following month he’d amassed more than 440,000 Instagram followers and was announced as the first male ambassador for US make-up brand CoverGirl. It was widely acknowledged as a pivotal moment for LGBT+ inclusivity and the beauty industry abandoning the gender stereotyping which it had been propagating for decades.\u0026nbspSuch was the impact of Charles’s story that he was invited on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to talk to the LGBT+ icon about his story. He appeared in a full face of make-up, discussing his sudden rise to internet fame, coming\u0026nbspout as gay aged 12, becoming interested in make-up and growing up on social media. Born in 1999, he was only five years old when Facebook was founded, seven when Twitter launched, and 11 when the first version of Instagram was released.\u0026nbspCoverGirl (James CharlesTwitter)His viral fame became emblematic of a generation of creators and celebrities whose careers took off on social media. Musician Billie Eilish, who was born in 2001, has achieved worldwide fame after the huge success of her single “Ocean Eyes”, which she posted on SoundCloud. Fellow singer Lil Nas X broke records this year when, aged 19, his song\u0026nbsp“Old Town Road”\u0026nbspbecame the longest-running hip-hop track on the Billboard Hot 100 after going viral on the video-sharing app TikTok. YouTuber Tana Mongeau found herself on real-life billboards all over LA this year after landing an MTV reality show based on the run-up to her 21st birthday. But Charles’s sudden fame landed him in a wholly different world.The top tier of beauty YouTubers is a place of fame, wealth and tremendous influence, punctuated by collaborations with the likes of Kim Kardashian, partnerships with behemoths of the make-up industry and incestuous, cliquey friendship groups that result in feuds and dramas that are all closely covered by commentary channels on YouTube, which are watched by millions.Everything wrong with the James Charles–Tati Westbrook controversyCharles’s meteoric rise to the top of this exclusive club has been uniquely defined by seemingly endless scandals. In February 2017 he was forced to apologise after a tweet in which he joked about getting Ebola while on a school trip to Africa. Just a few months later, fellow beauty influencer Thomas Halbert posted screenshots of conversations which seemed to discredit the ringlight story that led to Charles’s fame, suggesting he actually photoshopped his “poppin” highlight. In April 2019 he caught flak yet again after saying in a video that he was not “full gay” because he had been “into” trans guys, suggesting that they did not count as men for the purpose of identifying his sexuality.The following month he was widely ridiculed for posting on Instagram that his invitation to the Met Gala was “a step in the right direction for influencer representation in the media” and that he was glad to be the “catalyst”.\u0026nbspWhile his comments were somewhat tone-deaf and self-aggrandising as someone with such huge privilege, it’s true that the media and fashion industry\u0026nbsptend to ignore social media influencers in favour of covering more traditional celebrities, leading to a disconnect between the reality of their huge impact and lack of awareness among the masses.This was epitomised in January when Charles made an appearance at a shopping centre in Birmingham and thousands of fans brought the city centre to a standstill, much to the surprise of officials who clearly failed to understand the scope of his influence and plan accordingly.Charles’s wish to be acknowledged by the mainstream would soon be granted, but in a cruel twist of fate it would not be for his success, but for the projected death of his career.The cancelling of James CharlesTati Westbrook is a 37-year-old beauty YouTuber. She has been on the platform since 2010, and for much of that time was posting five videos a week, mostly focusing on product reviews and tutorials. Over almost a decade, she amassed more than 6 million subscribers and is widely respected on the platform for her perceived authenticity (unlike most influencers, she rarely accepts brand sponsorships) and ability to stay out of the drama despite her\u0026nbsppublic friendships with controversial figures such as Jeffree Star. Newsweek referred to her as “a progenitor of YouTube’s beauty scene” and indeed that is how she was broadly perceived among the community.So people were inclined to not only listen, but also blindly believe her allegations when she posted her now-infamous 43-minute video entitled “Bye Sister”\u0026nbsp– the title being a reference to Charles’s trademark term for his subscribers (“Hi sisters!”), his friends (“I’m doing a collaboration with sister Jeffree Star!”), and pretty much any word in his vocabulary (he’s going to put on a “sister winged liner”, his day is “sister stressful”, he gives people he likes a “sister shoutout”).Westbrook’s video (which has since been deleted) was ostensibly triggered by Charles accepting a sponsorship from vitamin supplement brand Sugar Bear Hair (SBH), which many – including Westbrook – saw as a betrayal of their friendship given the company is the main competitor to her supplement business Halo Beauty.\u0026nbspvlogger\u0026nbspin Birmingham: fans brought the city centre to a standstill, much to the surprise of officials, who had not prepared to accommodate them\u0026nbsp(James CharlesTwitter)Her response was, by most measures, brutal. It detailed how much she and her husband had done for Charles, acting as parents to the teenager, offering business and personal advice, helping him gain popularity and sponsorships, taking him under their wing. She discredited his story that he had to take the partnership with SBH because the brand had saved him from being mobbed at Coachella, and criticised him for promoting supplements to a young audience. She also made allegations of sexual misconduct, claiming Charles systematically tried to “convince straight men that they were gay” and was consistently inappropriate and coercive around men who were not interested in him.Posting the video was a risky move by Westbrook, who throughout it emphasised how much she “still cared” about her former friend. She has since stated that she had no idea how drastic the reaction would be, despite the loyalty of Charles’s audience, which was much larger than hers.\u0026nbspIt’s hard to imagine that anyone could have predicted what happened next – the video received millions of views, was on YouTube’s trending page, and subscribers started flocking away from Charles and towards Westbrook at record-breaking speed.\u0026nbspTati Westbrook during the now-deleted 43-minute video entitled ‘Bye Sister’ in which she details the allegations against her ‘former friend’ James Charles\u0026nbsp(TatiYouTube)Within a day he had lost 1 million subscribers – something that had never before occurred in the 14-year history of YouTube – Westbrook was simultaneously gaining hundreds of thousands of subscribers at lighting speed.\u0026nbspThis mass exodus continued for days and the feud was covered across\u0026nbspmedia outlets. Charles posted\u0026nbspa teary apology video\u0026nbspand other high-profile figures weighed in, including comments from huge influencers including Manny MUA in defence of Charles, and Jeffree Star backing Westbrook. Within days the race was on to see who would hit 10 million subscribers first – Charles, who began at 16 million, or Westbrook, who just days before was at 6 million.The story became a global talking point. People who had never watched a make-up tutorial in their lives were weighing in, and Charles was largely declared “cancelled”.Herd mentality and social media mob ruleThe YouTube community has been mired in scandals for years. Last summer\u0026nbspa wave of top-tier influencers (with Star at the centre of it) were called out for inappropriate content and behaviour Logan Paul, with 15 million subscribers, vlogged the dead body of a suicide victim for a video his brother Jake Paul (19 million subscribers) posted a video in which his YouTube nemesis FaZe Banks was falsely accused of assault Tana Mongeau (4.7 million subscribers) hosted a convention so disastrously organised that it left fans waiting outside for hours in blistering sun with no food or water creators including Shane Dawson (22 million subscribers) and Philip DeFranco (6.4 million subscribers) were accused of exploiting their followers’ mental health concerns for money after promoting the controversial BetterHelp app. Yet none of these situations came close to creating the kind of backlash Charles experienced.Hollie-Anne Brooks is a journalist and former editor of We The Unicorns, a digital publication that covers YouTuber news. She thinks that while Westbrook’s video kickstarted the backlash against Charles, it snowballed into a collective desire to be involved in the drama, which led many to follow in the footsteps of his first critics without questioning the reasons for doing so.“There were a lot of people who enjoyed getting caught up in the #JamesCharlesIsCancelled movement and it felt like you were part of a group,” she says.Katie Woodland is a psychologist who now works as a business coach, but her background is in child development. She believes that part of the reason for the extreme response to the scandal is the age of the subscribers involved.“When you’re a teenager you’re desperately looking for an identity and a tribe. Initially James Charles spoke to that need, being an outsider himself,” says Woodland. “The cliques and groups we pick as teenagers are part of us trying to work out where we belong and as soon as we align with someone, we feel they are an extension of our identity, but if they say or do something we feel doesn’t align with our world view, teenagers can feel truly betrayed, and want to hurt them back.”SBH and Westbrook’s story where she indicated she was upset about his post, but didn’t name him (Instagram)Woodland explains that due to the increased exposure to influencers’ day-to-day lives, younger generations can feel that they are within their orbit, compared to the more removed sense of fandom for traditional celebrities. As a result, the reaction can be as intense as if you were to fall out with a friend. Followers may also feel a connection to Westbrook, so by claiming Charles betrayed her, her younger viewers could empathise so deeply that they took Charles’s alleged actions personally.Research bears this out, showing that the brain isn’t fully developed until around age 25. According to the University of Rochester Medical Centre, adults think with the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s rational part. This is the region\u0026nbspof the brain that responds to situations with good judgment and an awareness of long-term consequences. Whereas teens process information with the amygdala, which governs emotions. As a result, young people are more likely to succumb to a “herd mentality”.Nicola Morgan is a psychologist who has spent decades researching the teenage brain. In her book The Teenage Guide to Friends, she writes that this phenomenon can lead to problematic behaviours. “Groups (including groups of adults) often react and behave emotionally, without thinking. The iniduals may hardly register that they’ve hurt anyone by their laughter, exclusion or thoughtless comments.”Tati Westbrook following scandalShe also writes that social media can exacerbate this behaviour in people of all ages “because of the ‘online disinhibition effect’, which describes how people often behave online in a way they wouldn’t do face-to-face. Group behaviour on social media causes problems for adults, too, as people of any age can behave badly, be cruel and have poor self-control.”He argues that part of the reason people feel comfortable “ganging up” on someone on social media is that it has become a comfortable echochamber for our own opinions. “Twitter’s like a sort of mutual approval machine,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Tech utopians call this a new type of democracy but it’s the opposite. In a democracy, you listen to each other.”YouTuber who\u0026nbspfaced worldwide scorn after uploading a controversial video in Japan’s suicide forest (Getty)The desire to surround ourselves by people who validate our views existed long before social media, but platforms like YouTube, Twitter and Instagram certainly exacerbate it. Writing in Psychology Today, moral psychologist Rob Henderson states that: “There is a heuristic most of us use to determine what to do, think, say, and buy: the principle of social proof. To learn what is correct, we look at what other people are doing.”The impulse to be part of a vindicated group – in this case, the people “cancelling” James Charles – is compounded by the unparalleled visibility of the sentiment. Social media analytics site Social Blade was live-streaming the subscriber differential for Charles and Westbrook, allowing viewers to watch Charles’s fall from grace in real time, and contributing to a collective mentality which lacked awareness of the potential nuance in the feudBrooks says that watching Charles’s subscriber count go down was “a meme and a moment on social media in itself”.Created with Sketch.Youtube\u0027s top 15 most subscribed channels in 2019 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The YouTube channel homepage for Indian record label T-Series, which overtook controversial Swedish vlogger PewDiePie in 2019PewDiePie has been the most popular YouTuber since 20135-Minute Crafts, which offers quick and quirky DIY tips to viewers, didn\u0027t even feature in the top 15 YouTube channels in July 2018Brazilian music video producer and director KondZilla began his career after buying a camera with life insurance money left to him after his mother died when he was 18Sony Entertainment Televesion (SET) launched in 1995 and has recently seen huge growth of its Hindi-language YouTube channelCanadian musician Justin Bieber held the number-two spot in 2018 before T-Series took over World Wrestling Entertainment has managed to gain a huge following on YouTube by sharing clips of fights and interviews with its starsThis YouTube channel specialises in 3D animation videos of nursery rhymes, as well as its own original songs.

While the accusations of treachery and entitlement may have riled viewers on an emotional level, the reaction to her claim that Charles was pressuring men into sexual contact elicited a more complex response.It would be naive to say that the Me Too movement has completely changed society’s view on sexual assault and harassment, but it is fair to suggest that in cases where accusations are made, the morally correct response is broadly understood to be:\u0026nbspbelieve the victim. But we forget that the allegations against Charles did not come from a victim, but from a former friend who – by her own admission – was a bystander in more than one of these apparent instances. Further, the power differential in the allegations against Charles isn’t as straightforward as that of Harvey Weinstein, for example – allegations of a straight, white,\u0026nbspmale\u0026nbspmultimillionaire\u0026nbspHollywood producer coercing young unknown female actors into sexual acts under the understanding that their refusal would end their careers.Jeffree Star and Tati’ video\u0026nbspposted in January, before the feud (James CharlesYouTube)In an episode of Radio 4’s Late Night Woman’s Hour, host Emma Barnett discussed the situation at the time with beauty journalist Sali Hughes and writer and broadcaster Miranda Sawyer. Hughes, who admits she didn’t know who James Charles was until that week, points out that he is “this barely-an-adult, young gay man in make-up – which is a hard thing to be in society”.\u0026nbspOf course, Charles does have a huge following, wealth, and stature in the community, so it’s not unfeasible that he could have wielded the power to pressure men into sex, but the narrative around the discussion at the time seemed to ignore the reality that there is a big difference between a heterosexual man pressuring a woman into sex, and a young gay man doing the same to straight men.AFPGetty)The double-edged sword of overnight fameHerd mentality and cancel culture do not lead to thoughtful analysis of a situation, but rather to a distilled version of a story which people will blindly latch onto to validate their own beliefs, and a pervasive one is that influencers largely do not deserve the acclaim and success they achieve.\u0026nbspThey are seen as narcissistic and entitled. People who manage to make a living just by being young and charismatic. This sense of unfairness around their success is amplified in cases like that of Charles, whose sudden rise to internet fame was not necessarily unique, but the scope of his influence and the lightning speed with which he achieved it is unparalleled.By May 2019 – just over two and a half years after the ringlight photo – Charles had 16.6 million subscribers on YouTube, putting him in an elite category of beauty influencers alongside Rachel Claire Levin (14 million subscribers), who began posting YouTube videos in 2010 Jeffree Star (15 million subscribers), whose audience has been growing since the mid-2000s when he was one of the most popular pages on MySpace NikkieTutorials (12 million subscribers), who’s been posting on YouTube since 2010 and Safiya Nygaard, who rose to prominence when she made videos for BuzzFeed in 2015. Charles’s overnight success stood in huge contrast to the reality of “making it” as an influencer, which typically involves years of hard graft and steady growth.YouTuber outside his dressing room on ‘Ellen’ in 2016: he discussed fame, coming out, make-up and social media with the LGBT+ icon (James CharlesInstagram)Brooks believes his fast rise to fame may have been a key factor in the collective desire to take him down. “A lot of YouTubers – including Tati Westbrook – started at a time when the industry and the community wasn’t so fickle. James’s very quick rise to fame in a way gives way to his downfall.”She explains that while YouTubers who have been on the platform for a decade have a dedicated, loyal audience, the new wave of followers who have latched onto Charles recently have not developed the long-term allegiance to him, and know they have hundreds of others creators out there whose content they can consume instead.Influencer and author Emily Clarkson wrote about the scandal as it was unfolding. On her blog, Pretty Normal Me, she wrote that James Charles was “a victim of his own success”.“For months and years he has been treated like a god, been made allowances for, had his bad behaviour excused because of his celebrity status. In turn, he got swept up in himself and his life and his wealth and his fame. He lost his sense of everything important and he fucked up. And now he’s paying the price. He is a victim of his own success, of an industry that builds people to extraordinary levels. And one that tears them down at a moment’s notice too,” she said at the time.It’s impossible not to see the parallels between Charles – someone who achieved giddy heights of recognition at such a young age – and the schadenfreude with which society has always consumed stories of young celebrities falling from grace.\u0026nbspKardashian in 2016: Kardashian unfollowed Charles during the Westbrook feud, but they have since made up (James CharlesInstagram)In an article examining the fallout from Britney Spears’s notorious breakdown in 2007, author Kate Leaver writes: “It was us, after all, who destroyed her. She didn’t crumble in isolation or simply of her own volition she overdosed on fame and we were complicit in that. We made her the single most watched human being on the planet and then, gleefully, watched as she nearly died from overexposure. We celebrated her ascent to celebrity and then punished her for attaining the very perfection we demand.”We can see this unflattering trait of society in the way we’ve revelled in the demise of countless other young celebrities – Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Bynes and Aaron Carter to name just a few. While Charles’s fame may be slightly more niche than his mainstream counterparts, he was by no means insulated from the cruel delight with which the people who built him up rushed to take him down.Charles made a fatal error in his handling of the situation – one which it seemed might cost him any chance of overcoming the mass exodus of his followers: he uploaded an apology video.Tati Westbrook following the James Charles \u0027Bye Sister\u0027 scandal: \u0027I don\u0027t want you guys hating him\u0027YouTube has seen so many apology videos that the concept has become a meme in and of itself. Earlier this year, images of a child who attended VidCon – the world’s biggest YouTuber convention – dressed as an apology video went viral. These videos are generally portrayed as unscripted and teary, with the influencer in question usually make-up free and wearing the strangely ubiquitous grey hoodie.Writing about the “apology video genre” for Vice, journalist Bettina Makalintal says: “On YouTube, apologies …\u0026nbsphave become just another product. With high-profile stars always selling something, the apology video is a necessary step of damage control. And if the scandal blows up enough, the apology video can be a way of reeling in new viewers, too – plenty of people, I’m sure, hadn’t heard of Tati Westbrook or James Charles until explainers of their situation ended up everywhere.”Indeed, Charles’s eight-minute now-deleted response video, somewhat gauchely titled “Tati”, did little but add fuel to the fire, and gave viewers further fodder to ridicule him. Grey hoodie-clad and make-up-free, he emphasised how distressed he was by the situation, and at one point rather bizarrely even spoke directly to his mother to apologise.It seemed like it couldn’t get any worse for Charles, and people speculated that his career was over.Then, on 18 May, just over a week after this all began, Charles came back with a vengeance in a second video about the scandal.\u0026nbspIn flawless make-up and with a crisp white backdrop and not a tear in sight, Charles calmly and respectfully spent 41 minutes breaking down Westbrook’s allegations and – crucially – he provided “receipts” – evidence to back up his claims. Westbrook’s original “Bye Sister”\u0026nbspvideo offered no such proof, and relied on the credibility of her personal brand to back her up. While this initially worked, now followers had questions. Suddenly, a second wave of criticism started to boil up on social media, this time\u0026nbsptowards Westbrook, who\u0026nbspher followers began to feel was more calculated in her original video than they originally believed.Charles quickly gained back more than a million subscribers, while Westbrook’s began to fall. At the time of writing, just over two months after it all began, Charles’s Social Blade is consistently green (meaning he’s gaining followers rather than losing them), and he stands at over 15.9 million subscribers – almost as many as he had before the fateful\u0026nbspSBH\u0026nbspsponsored post.“James Charles turned himself around very quickly, and I thought it was very interesting to see how he handled it,” says Brooks. “A lot of people probably expected him to stay silent for a very long time – but for him, that would mean admitting guilt which he didn’t think he had – or to really hit back in this really extravagant, dramatic, almost bitchy way that we’re used to seeing James do.”After his video was posted, both Westbrook and Star (who had been publicly lashing out against Charles and threatened to post a tell-all video “exposing” him) gracefully backed down, saying they would no longer be addressing any of the allegations.Jeffree Star speaking about his relationships after Charles named him in his ‘No Mores Lies’ video (Jeffree StarYouTube)Within the subsequent couple of weeks most of the videos and tweets made by Westbrook and Star were quietly deleted, leading many to believe this was a carefully orchestrated – and highly successful – act of damage control involving lawyers.That’s not to say Charles hasn’t lost out. His clothing brand Sisters Apparel, which was distributed by Star’s company Killer Merch, was conspicuously unavailable while this unfoldedJames Charles cancels his Sisters tour after Tati Westbrook rowThis is why the James Charles and Tati Westbrook feud matters so muchJeffree Star wades into feud between James Charles and Tati WestbrookHe also had to cancel a series of live events entitled – you guessed it – Sisters Tour, at least in part due to the impact of the feud. It could also affect his chances of gaining brand sponsorships in the future –\u0026nbspespecially given his history of scandals – and there are still\u0026nbspquestions about the allegations of sexual misconduct made by Westbrook, as he is yet to respond directly. Although, he did “vehemently deny” the allegations made by Gage Gomez that he felt pressurised into sexual activity with the YouTuber when the pair attended Coachella together\u0026nbspearlier this year.But Westbrook hasn’t come out of this well either. Although her subscriber count sits at just under 10 million, her Social Blade is consistently red, meaning she’s losing subscribers on a daily basis. This makes sense – with the outrage at Charles all but gone, many people are back to subscribing based on content, rather than moral judgment, and many of Westbrook’s new followers who wanted to jump on the “cancel James Charles” bandwagon may not actually be fans of her video style. Meanwhile devoted followers may be rethinking their loyalty towards her as the motives behind her original video are called into question.It’s hard to imagine another scandal hitting as hard or rippling as wide as this one.\u0026nbspUsers have perhaps learnt a lesson in the potential consequences of acting on impulse.Brooks believes the debacle has changed the YouTube beauty industry. “Since the drama, we’re realising that we’re feeding into a bigger PR machine more than the audience perhaps realised,” she says.She explains that while\u0026nbsp“authenticity” used to be the currency\u0026nbspfor YouTubers among audiences now in their late 20s who consumed this kind of content a decade ago, younger followers are looking more for the dramatic, soap-opera-esque escapism.Kylie Jenner appeared on Charles’s channel for a Halloween special in 2018 (James CharlesYouTube)“We need to reestablish the balance because there is drama, and while that’s OK for some it’s not necessarily setting the best example or showing the beauty industry in the best light. We need to take a step back and look at the creators who aren’t all about the drama and the big flashiness, what they’re doing is be exceptionally talented – and push those people to the forefront.”While the rise, fall, and rise again of James Charles is unlikely to end a culture of scandal and drama among the beauty YouTuber community, it may well be the catalyst for change in the way audiences react to it.In June, YouTuber Jaclyn Hill (6 million subscribers) released a line of lipsticks which was met with disastrous feedback and allegations that they were expired or contaminated due to reports of plastic and metal shards embedded in the lipstick, holes and grittiness in the products and fluff and hairs in\u0026nbspthe formula.For those eagerly awaiting the next YouTube scandal, this was it. It featured a notoriously controversial influencer, hundreds of thousands of angry consumers, conspiracy theories and endless commentary videos and input from other established YouTubers.\u0026nbspAnd yet while the backlash has been harsh, it has also been measured. Drama channels are treating the scandal with care, urging their viewers to be mindful of Hill’s mental health, and while she is losing subscribers, the numbers are in the hundreds, not the millions.\u0026nbspIt’s hard to imagine her getting off so lightly had this occurred pre-James Charles, and that is surely a sign of a change in the tide of influencer backlash and cancel culture.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This could hit “vulnerable groups”.* Potential clashes between UK and European Economic Area fishing vessels amid predictions that 282 ships will sail in British waters illegally on Brexit day.* Rising costs will hit social care, with “smaller providers impacted within 2-3 months and larger providers 4-6 months after exit”.A senior Whitehall source told The Sunday Times: “This is the most realistic assessment of what the public face with no deal. These are likely, basic, reasonable scenarios – not the worst case.”However, despite the fact they are official documents, Kwasi Kwarteng, the energy minister, said: “There is a lot of scaremongering around. A lot of people are playing into project fear.”He also claimed: “We will be fully prepared to leave without a deal on 31 October.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was higher than a year ago, the 1.2 per cent annual rise still lagged inflation, which is running at 2.1 per cent according to the latest official data.“There is little doubt that the market continues to face its inevitable challenges,” said Glynis Frew, chief executive of Hunters, an estate agency with over 200 branches across Britain.Official data showed last week that the average price at which homes are sold grew only 0.9 per cent in the year to June, while in London it tumbled by 2.7 per cent. The average British home cost £230,292 in June, down from a peak of £232,000 in August 2018.Buyers have been biding their time as it remains unclear whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal. In the latter case, house prices could plunge by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021, according to forecasts by the government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.However, the more confident buyers are now abandoning the ‘wait and see’ approach and taking advantage of improved housing affordability as the Brexit deadline nears, Ms Frew said, commenting on Rightmove’s findings.For its latest report, Rightmove measured 130,435 asking prices, covering around 90 per cent of the UK market. The properties were put on sale by estate agents between 7 July to 10 August and advertised on rightmove.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

Not for a moment did they envisage having to act on it.The letter was — like almost everything Mr Corbyn has ever said or done — about posturing rather than acting. The Labour leader spent  years as a backbencher before his elevation to being Leader of the Opposition.During those three decades he achieved precisely nothing.Had he not been elected leader, the few people to have been aware of his existence would have known him as a minor fringe MP who hung out with terrorists and racists.The sum total of his contribution to politics as a backbencher was to have proposed  Early Day Motions, the parliamentary equivalent of tweeting.Topics which he considered worth his time included “seal genitalia”, “Disney children’s pyjamas” and an MI proposal to use pigeons as flying bombs.Mr Corbyn’s natural disposition is to tear down, to criticise and to oppose.He could not even bring himself to support his own party when it was in power, voting against the last Labour government  times.There is not a single piece of legislation that owes anything to his contribution.This is the context in which his and Labour’s seemingly incoherent stance on Brexit — one day against another referendum, another day for one one day for Brexit, another day for Remain — must be seen.He is uninterested in the mechanics of a concrete solution. He has no real views on the details of Brexit or even how we get there.For Mr Corbyn, Brexit is a means to an end — which is as a vehicle to power.That is why, for example, he has on  occasions instructed Labour MPs either to abstain or to vote with the Government on Brexit, rather than attempting in any serious way to force the Government to change course, either over the type or Brexit on offer or a second referendum.He wants Brexit.He and his coterie of revolutionary socialists believe that leaving without a deal will be chaotic and that in that chaos Labour will be swept into office.But that, by definition, requires Brexit both to happen and to be chaotic.Most of his party take a dferent view — most are Remainers — so every so often the Corbynites view it as tactically wise to offer the appearance of wanting to work against the Government’s version of Brexit.Hence yesterday’s letter. But it is all meaningless posing. In her speech yesterday rejecting Mr Corbyn’s demand that she support him as PM, Jo Swinson hit the nail on the head.She said: “In my first week as leader of the Liberal Democrats I called on Jeremy Corbyn to table a vote of no confidence in the Government and I asked him to table it before summer recess, because that was the only way to be sure we could hold an election before crashing out on the st of October.”You do not have to share Ms Swinson’s opposition to Brexit to accept that her analysis is spot on.Mr Corbyn refused to table such a vote of no confidence at the end of July. Had he actually wanted to avoid No Deal, he would have done.There was every chance Boris Johnson’s new government would have lost and we would now be in the middle of an election campaign.Whatever the outcome of that election, we would not — as we are now — be spending time analysing the prospects of a so-called government of national unity or looking at cynical letters written by the Labour leader.Mr Corbyn and his allies doubtless think they are being extremely clever, riding two horses at the same time.But his problem is that every time he opens his mouth, the unsuitability for office becomes ever clearer. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats why we want a deal.But it is also the case that the UK government is far more prepared now than it was in the past.But a former head of the British civil service, Lord Bob Kerslake, who described the document as credible, said the dossier lays bare the scale of the risks we are facing with no-deal Brexit in almost every area.He added: These risks are completely insane for this country to be taking and we have to explore every avenue to avoid them.Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said, in a tweet, that Ireland had always been clear a hard border in Ireland must be avoided.The leak comes as Boris Johnson prepares to travel to Berlin to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, before going to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron the following day.Mr Johnson has repeatedly vowed to leave the bloc on Halloween with or without a deal - and pointed the finger at the anti-democratic EU for pushing the UK towards a No Deal by refusing to negotiate.After more than three years of Brexit dominating EU affairs, the bloc has repeatedly refused to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement which includes an Irish border insurance policy that Johnsons predecessor, Theresa May, agreed in November.Mr Johnson will tell Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron there must be a new Brexit deal when he makes his first trip abroad as PM.Details of the PMs travel plans emerged as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterated his call for MPs to work together to prevent a no-deal Brexit.Mr Corbyn, who set out his plan to be installed as a caretaker prime minister last week to stop the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal, said his proposal is the most democratic way to prevent a no-deal."},{"url":null,"title":"brits would rather have a no deal brexit than let jeremy corbyn wreak havoc in no10 poll reveals","story":"Nearly half of voters want to leave the bloc without a withdrawal agreementit means the Labour boss stays away from Downing Street.Forty eight per cent of voters want Corbyn away from No but around a third,  per cent, preferred the option of Corbyn as PM and a second referendum being staged.Meanwhile  per cent of voters were unsure either way, a YouGov poll found.The vote also found that almost a quarter of Remain voters would prefer No Dealit meant no Corbyn in No, while  per cent of Labour voters say the same about their own leader.While  per cent of Leave voters would rather a No Deal Brexitit meant no Corbyn -

There are lots of back channel conversations.Boris is said to have blasted Hammond for gravely damaging the national interest with his bids to frustrate Brexit.In a letter seen by the Mail on Sunday, the PM said it was plain as a pikestaff that the EU will simply not compromise as long as they believe there is the faintest possibility that Parliament can block Brexit on  October.Downing Street sources also accused Tory Remainers of appalling dishonesty for attempting to use the Brexit delay to cancel the referendum.The comments come after Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay signed the commencement order that will trigger the end of the supremacy of EU law in the UK on October .Hammond and Gauke’s plot to stop the will of the people comes as Boris head to to Paris and Berlin for talks with EU leaders, before a G summit where hell meet President Trump too.The PM says he still wants to get a deal but he wont re-start talks until Brussels agrees to drop the hated Northern Irish backstop.Yesterday No lashed out at Remainer scare stories about a No Deal Brexit, saying they were deliberately leaked to discredit the Government.And they claimed the reports - which included Project Fear stories about shortages of food in the event we leave without a deal - were old anyway. MPs have demanded that Parliament be recalled to find a solution to the Brexit crisis.Politicians arent due back in Westminster for another two weeks."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/health-news/\" class=\"t-s-border-color t-p-color\"\u003eHealth News\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"swiper-button-prev t-s-background-color__before t-p-background-color swiper-button-disabled\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"icon icon-arrow-left icon-arrow-left-white t-p-background-color\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"swiper-button-next t-s-background-color__before t-p-background-color\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"icon icon-arrow-right icon-arrow-right-white t-p-background-color\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"main-content\" class=\"main-content-wrap theme-main has-section-nav \" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"billboard\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"advert-wrapper advert-wrapper--billboard\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"billboard\" class=\"dfp-ad\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003csection class=\"sun-container__article-section theme-news\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sun-row sun-container__home-section--breaking\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"col sun-col-6\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"teaser-item teaser__video teaser-item--breaking\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"teaser__image-container\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"teaser__copy-container\"\u003e\u003cheader class=\"article__header\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__strapline\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003csection class=\"article__headline-section--offset article__headline-section\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article__kicker t-p-color\"\u003eCRUISE CONTROL \u003c/span\u003e\u003ch1 class=\"article__headline\"\u003eTom Cruise moves his family into his luxury Scientology apartment block ‘to stop them leaving cult like Katie Holmes’\u003c/h1\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__meta article_standard article_isFeaturedVideo t-p-border-color\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__name-date\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-slug article-slug--article-page t-p-background-color\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article-slug__copy\"\u003eExclusive\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__author\"\u003e\u003cul class=\"article__ul\" itemProp=\"author\"\u003e\u003cli class=\"article__author-list t-p-background-color__before\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article__author-name t-p-color\"\u003eChris White\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul class=\"article__time\"\u003e\u003cli class=\"article__published\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article__datestamp\"\u003e18 Aug 2019,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article__timestamp\"\u003e 21:58\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"article__updated\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article__datestamp\"\u003eUpdated: 19 Aug 2019,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article__timestamp\"\u003e 1:55\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"bc-video-6074230396001\" class=\"brightcove brightcove--is-featured \"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"lazyload brightcove__holder\"\u003e\u003cvideo data-account=\"5067014667001\" data-is-featured=\"true\" data-player=\"default\" data-video-id-pending=\"6074230396001\" id=\"video_60742303960","title":"tom cruise katie holmes scientology apartment california","story":"The actors three sisters Cass Capazorio, Lee Anne Gillotte and Marian Henry have all purchased apartments at The Skyview, Florida, property records show.The Church dedicated condo is situated just yards away from its global headquarters in Clearwater.They now live on the third, fourth and fth floors, while their -year-old brother has got the eighth and ninth floor, two-story penthouse.We can also reveal that Cruise has hoovered up two other apartments on the second and third floor respectively -

But the chances of a breakthrough look bleak with the EU still refusing to reopen the -page Brexit withdrawal agreement. The Operation Yellowhammer document was leaked to the Sunday Times - prompting a furious response from Downing Street. Despite the document being produced by his own government, Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng blamed it on scaremongering and a lot of people playing into Project Fear. A Number  source said: This document is from when ministers were blocking what needed to be done to get ready to leave and the funds were not available.  It has been deliberately leaked by a former minister in an attempt to influence discussions with EU leaders. Those obstructing preparation are no longer in Government, £ billion of extra funding already made available and Whitehall has been stood up to actually do the work through the daily ministerial meetings. The entire posture of Government has changed. The Mirror understands the document was presented at a Brexit aposwar cabinetapos meeting around a week after Boris Johnson took power. Yet a Downing Street spokeswoman said the leaked dossier was out of date and we are making all necessary preparations ahead of October . The spokeswoman said: In relation to business we have been engaging widely and will continue to do so and thataposs been signicantly stepped up in recent weeks. We have published numerous documents on how businesses can prepare. You can expect to see further information being published in the coming weeks in relation to how the public... can further prepare and the changes that they are likely to see across a range of areas. A large-scale public information campaign is expected to begin shortly, Downing Street added. Askedthere was a mole hunt, she said: I’m not aware of any inquiry per se. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said MPs mustto hold increasingly reckless Boris Johnson to account.  She told the BBC: I think there is ever more evidence of the, frankly, impending national emergency that we are facing.

These days, far from flying by the seat of their pants as their predecessors did, it is a hi-tech profession. But even with the RAF’s new £million F-B Lightning stealth fighters – the most advanced and ­expensive weapons system in military history –there is a problem, incredibly, the solution is the same as with your phone... just turn it on and off again. Flight Lieutenant Bally is the star of new ITV documentary Fighter Pilot: The Real Top Gun, which goes inside the cockpit to reveal the intense training these brave men and women undergo to fly the new jewel in the RAF’s crown.    However, his first encounter with the plane at a training base in South ­Carolina in the US did not go to plan – he couldn’t start the plane. The jet has a sophisticated security system to keep out the enemy with its radar-evading stealth technology, but it’s so secure that sometimes its own pilot cannot log in. Bally’s instructor, a US Marine by the name of Chandler, explains: “It’s a process we call ‘cold iron’. “Essentially it’s like pressing ‘control, alt, delete’ for a computer. Because the jet is a big computer, we shut it down and restart it. Hopefully that clears up any hiccups , and we can go from there.” THERE are only eight frontline female fighter pilots in the UK. Danielle, known as Danners, , hopes to join the Lightning squad. But first she has to pass a gruelling course at the RAF’s academy in North Wales. Like Bally, she does not liken herself to Maverick. She said: “I don’t see myself as the stereotypical kind of alpha-male fighter pilot. They’re very confident and very outgoing. That just hasn’t been me.” Before training to fly the Lightning, Danners, from the Midlands, was a Flight Lieutenant in the  Naval Air Squadron. She decided to join the Navy after having a flight in a glider on a school trip. She says: “That’s when the bug hit for me.”   Raring to go, Bally – his nickname – has to wait for Chandler to fix the problem before he can fly the jet for the first time. “I was thinking, ‘this is absolutely typical’,” he says. “But we’re talking about something which is the cutting edge of military technology. “Everything’s got to be set up in the right order for it to work and one of those beeps or squeaks might not happen in the right order and you might have to restart it again. “Switching it off and on fixes most things!” And then he’s away at speeds of up to ,mph, which would terry the rest of us. “There’s certainly no fear, some nervousness, which heightens the senses a little,” he says.  “One of the first things you do on that first trip is to go ­supersonic. When you break the sound barrier, which you can do in a climb at ,ft, all the aircraft does is wallow a little from left to right and then everything s­tabilises again. “And that’s it – it’s smooth as anything. It’s an ­incredible experience. The manoeuvrability and ­performance is eye-watering. It is phenomenal the climb rate, the speed, the ­performance in the turn, it is fantastic.” Bally serves in the RAF’s legendary  Squadron – the Dam Busters – and was a Tornado jet pilot for four years before qualying to the fly the Lightning. So, how much of a Maverick – the character Tom Cruise plays in  hit film Top Gun – is the dad-of-two  “I didn’t want to upset Tom Cruise, but I think the only thing we have in common is height! Certainly not money or good looks,” the -year-old laughs. “Growing up Top Gun was one of my favourite films. But no, I think Maverick would actually be in jail in real le or at the very least, he wouldn’t be flying fast jets anymore. Maverick is not what we’re after in real fighter jet pilots!” Do the real top guns sit around quoting the film to one another   “No we actually do not,” he says ­defiantly. “I think there’s an unwritten rule that you’ll be fined a crate of beersyou quote it to anyone!” It was during a walking holiday in the Lake District when he was a lad that Bally, who grew up in Scotland, realised he wanted to become a fighter pilot. “I’m one of those lucky people that is really following a dream doing this job. I remember walking through the lakes and on the hills I’d hear that roar of a jet. “One time a Harrier flew over my head. The aircraft was inverted and pulling down into a valley over the ridge we were walking down. I looked up and I could see the pilot looking down on me. I thought, ‘Wow I would love to do that’.” Before flying the Lightning, Bally served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria in a Tornado fighter jet. “It can be hard,” he admits. “Flying on ops is long sorties, punctuated by moments of extreme adrenaline and a requirement to be absolutely on top of your game, which is really challenging after a long period of flying.  “In that moment, when you’re being asked to carry out ops, you’re focused on carrying it out to the best of your ability and doing it utterly professionally. “That is crucial. We need to make sure we don’t make a mistake and don’t end up affecting an unintended target.” It’s not a job for the faint-hearted and he says it’s important to deal with the reality of war once he’s got two feet back on the ground. “You wouldn’t be humanyou didn’t think about it. It’s important to be able to reflect on those things and that you come to terms with that.” The front line isn’t the hard part, he says, but being away from his we and two young children is tough. “It really is painful being away from them for so long at times. Being apart is dficult and my we bears the brunt of that. It’s a team effort, she’s hugely supportive and thank goodness for her.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton living fantasy george","story":"NewsKate Middleton is living a fantasy with George, Charlotte and Louiss upbringingsKate Middleton and Prince William say they want their kids Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis to have a normal upbringing away from the pressures of being in the Royal FamilyShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video kate-bringing-children-cha-see-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The Duchess of Cambridge aposs belief that she can give her children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis a aposnormalapos upbringing is just a fantasy, a royal expert has claimed.

Speaking to People magazine, she said: Even the Queen in the ’s said she wanted her children brought up as normally as possible. But it’s a fantasy. Princess Diana did everything she could to let her sons experience aposnormal leapos, taking them to McDonaldaposs and making them ride on the bus.    Before Diana, royal children were mainly raised by Palace staff including a team of dedicated nannies. The Queen wasnapost particularly involved in raising her children, and was often away for a months at a time when they were young.But after the birth of Princes William and Harry, Diana changed all this with her hands-on approach . She didnapost want them to miss out on anything, so during the Easter holidays  she treated her boys to a day out at Thorpe Park .   Sticking with her plan to keep things normal, she told staff she wanted to be treated like everyone , including queueing for all the rides.Dianaaposs former butler and close friend Paul Burrell told the Mirror about the trioaposs Saturday night ritual .The loving mum would take her boys to McDonaldaposs, where they would order Big Macs and chips. They would then come home and sit on a giant stuffed hippopotamus Diana had in front of the TV and watch Blind Date.   Mr Burrell said: The three of them would nip to McDonald’s for a  Big Mac  and fries before coming back to watch Blind Date. All three of them would squat on this massive, stuffed hippopotamus Diana had in her sitting room.They loved Blind Date and I’d hear them all screaming things like “Oh don’t pick him!” and “Lorra, lorra fun”.

But the eco-warriors have been branded hypocrites and urged to lead by example after jetting to Ibiza and Nice on luxury jets which have been condemned by environmentalists. The -seat Cessna plane that flew the royals from Spain to the south of France last Wednesday belched seven times the emissions per person compared to a commercial flight, it is estimated.    The flight to Nice last Wednesday was Harry and Meghanaposs third private jet flight in just eight days and it came just weeks after the duke, who has vowed to cut the familyaposs carbon footprint, used a private jet to fly to Sicily for a Google climate summit. The Sussexes - who were accompanied by aides and security - frequently use their Instagram account to preach about environmentalism and conservation to their .million followers. Former Suits actress Meghan, , wore a white blouse and cream sun hat as she carried three-month-old Archie, clad in a cream and navy striped jumper, off the plane in Nice. Harry, dressed in a green polo shirt, blue hat and sunglasses, was also pictured walking off the £million Cessna Citation Sovereign, which is registered to NetJets, a firm dubbed aposUber for billionairesapos thanks to its wealthy clientele.    Experts say it would have cost about £, for aflight. It was not known who paid for the flights. The royalsapos luggage was loaded into a vehicle and they were driven away from the airport as their second Mediterranean holiday of the summer got under way. They werre reportedly staying at a private village overlooking the sea. The family landed in Nice two days after flying to the UK from Ibiza, where they reportedly stayed in a luxury resort for the rich and famous that costs up to £, a week.  They reportedly spent six days on the Spanish island to celebrate Meghan’s th birthday. It was Archieaposs first holiday abroad. They originally flew to Ibiza on August  and ed on August . It is thought they spent two nights back at home at Frogmore Cottage before flying to Nice. It as unclear whether Meghan, Harry, , and Archie were still in the south of France or whether they have ed to the UK. Flight data showed the plane leaving the airport in Nice and ing to Farnborough on Saturday.  The Sussexes have faced criticism for their private jet jaunts. Labour MP Teresa Pearce told the Sun: “Given the position they have taken publicly about being responsible on climate change, this does seem an anomaly which they should look at. Someone as high profile as that should lead by example. “I find this quite surprising because it doesn’t fit with their public image and the way they’re so concerned about the planet and the environment.” Former royal protection officer Ken Wharfe, who guarded Harryaposs mum Princess Diana, said: Frankly itaposs hypocritical.  Harry canapost be preaching about the catastrophic effects of climate change while jetting around the world on a private plane. Last Wednesday they travelled  miles from their home, Frogmore Cottage, on the Queenaposs Windsor estate to Farnborough Airport in Hampshire, where they hopped on board the Nice-bound jet.There are more than  scheduled commercial flights from London-area airports to Nice every Wednesday, costing as little as £per person. The trip to France is estimated to have had a carbon footprint of just over three tons and the earlier trip to Ibiza is believed to have had a footprint of more than four tons.The carbon footprint of an average person in the UK is  tons a year.    But fans have come to the coupleaposs defence, saying it is unlikely they would take a budget flight with Archie - and dozens of tourists - due to ious concerns. A spokeswoman for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex declined to comment. It emerged last month that Harry - who has flown commercial in the past - and Meghan plan to have no more than two children due to their concerns for the environment. Harry interviewed primatologist Jane Goodall for the September issue of Vogue, which was guest-edited by his we Meghan. The prince admitted his perspective had changed since the couple welcomed Archie in May. He said Iaposve always wanted to try and ensure that, even before having a child and hoping to have children as Ms Goodall interrupted: Not too many.

But one particular incident that is said to have raised eyebrows involved Diana and Her Majesty, , during one Christmas lunch at Sandringham. Diana, who died aged  in , reportedly asked a aposbrutal questionapos which left the rest of the Royal Family  - including Prince Charles - aposlooking at her asshe were mad.apos It was while around the dinner table, Diana reportedly broached the subject of the Royal Family and a federal Europe. According to royal biographer Andrew Morton, he claims Diana asked whether the royals would be relevant.  Writing in his book Diana: Her True Story, Mr Morton wrote: “The Queen, Prince Charles and the rest of the royal family looked at her asshe were mad and continued with their debate on who shot the last pheasant of the day, a discussion which occupied the rest of the evening. “As a friend says: ‘She finds the monarchy claustrophobic and completely outdated with no relevance to today’s le and problems. “She feels that it is a crumbling institution and believes that the family won’t know what has hit them in a few years’ time unless it changes too’.” Meanwhile, it was after Dianaaposs death in Paris that it emerged she had helped with the blisteringly honest book Diana: Her True Story. The mum-of-two collaborated with royal biographer Mr Morton and got her friends and family to talk candidly about her troubled marriage with Charles.  Details of le inside the House of Windsor and even her relationship with the Queen were revealed. The Queen was allegedly stunned by what was written and that her daughter-in-law would air her dirty linen in such a way. But Diana admitted she felt desperate and asshe was at the end of her tether. However despite clashing over their dferences, the Queen described Diana as an exceptional and gted human being. In a public tribute to Diana days after her death, Her Majesty said: Since last Sundayaposs dreadful news we have seen, throughout Britain and around the world, an overwhelming expression of sadness at Dianaaposs death.  We have all been trying in our dferent ways to cope. It is not easy to express a sense of loss, since the initial shock is often succeeded by a mixture of other feelings: disbelief, incomprehension, anger - and concern for those who remain. We have all felt those emotions in these last few days. So what I say to you now, as your Queen and as a grandmother, I say from my heart. First, I want to pay tribute to Diana myself. She was an exceptional and gted human being. In good times and bad, she never lost her capacity to smile and laugh, nor to inspire others with her warmth and kindness. I admired and respected her - for her energy and commitment to others, and especially for her devotion to her two boys. This week at Balmoral, we have all been trying to help William and Harry come to terms with the devastating loss that they and the rest of us have suffered.    No-one who knew Diana will ever forget her. Millions of others who never met her, but felt they knew her, will remember her. I for one believe that there are lessons to be drawn from her le and from the extraordinary and moving reaction to her death. I share in your determination to cherish her memory. This is also an opportunity for me, on behalf of my family, and especially Prince Charles and William and Harry, to thank all of you who have brought flowers, sent messages, and paid your respects in so many ways to a remarkable person. These acts of kindness have been a huge source of help and comfort.

A few hours later, Helen was lying on her bed with what she thought was a tight chest.    I have never been ill in my le so I knew something was really wrong, she said. I was struggling to breathe and all of a sudden I was having pains in my arm. I phoned the doctors and the receptionist said that you need to go to hospital right now. I really started to panic then. The paramedics arrived and carried out an ECG, which came up fine, but Helen knew something was wrong so insisted she be taken to hospital. They went to help me up and I just fell through their arms and I was looking up at them confused as to why I wasnapost stood up.    Helen had not suffered a fall or experienced anything to bring on the condition, which often occurs after a viral or bacterial infection. She remembers doctors asking her parentsshe had taken anything. The next day I was taken to Morriston Hospital in Swansea, and they were doing that thing to test your reflexes, where your leg is supposed to shoot up after your knee is tapped. My leg wasnapost doing that. I was crying, I couldnapost even wipe my own tears. Helenaposs condition affects around  people a year, and it is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation in the spinal cord. There is currently no cure for transverse myelitis, but treatments and rehabilitation can help with recovery and lessen the symptoms.    Helen spent six months in hospital and a further  months in rehab and has since regained some movement and strength in her arms. She now lives in a specially adapted ground floor flat in Aberkenfig, Bridgend. I can move my arms enough to feed myself but I canapost cut up food or prepare anything like that. I need full on care. I canapost do much independently. Three years after the unexplained incident, Helen relies on carers to do most things for her. She receives seven hours of care a day, two hours of which takes up her morning routine and one hour for her night time routine. That leaves her with just four hours of support during the day to go out and do everything that she wants to do. Last year, when it was really hot, I couldnapost even get outside by myself to sit out in the sunshine. I was just stuck inside waiting for my carers to come. I rely on people to wash me, dress me, move me, get me out of the car. I am so appreciative of the care I receive, but I just want to be able to do things for myself like any other -year-old. I love getting out of the house, I have been imprisoned long enough.

Will Fraser-Gray, from Galgate in Lancaster, was heading home after a night out celebrating a friendaposs st birthday in Georgia, USA, where he studies, when the car crashed while he wasnapost wearing a seatbelt. He was left with a major head injury, broken ribs, a fractured neck and punctured lung. But he wonapost stop playing the sport he loves - even though one bump to the head could now be aposcatastrophicapos. The talented -year-old had won a scholarship to play at Emmanuel College in Georgia. But the smash threatened to steal his dreams of a professional football career.  He was left hospitalised for months and had to learn how to walk again. However, after making a miracle recovery in the US and ing home to reunite with family last month, Will has now flown back across the pond to carry on playing the game. He will need a special helmet to protect his head, which has still not fully healed. He said: After the crash, I woke up a week and  days later and I remember looking over and seeing my mum and dad and quickly realising it must be badtheyaposd had to fly out. The doctors had taken half my skull out to relieve the pressure on my brain, I had a fracture and a ruptured ligament in my neck, a punctured lung, broken ribs, a lacerated liver and damaged spleen.  They told me Iaposd never be able to play football again without protective head gear, but as soon as I heard I could even play again it motivated me so much. Football is pretty much my le, I donapost even entertain the idea that somebody would be able to take that ability away from me. I was in a pretty horric crash, but hearing the doctors say I was going to be able to play again was the best thing in the world. Itaposs about proving people wrong.    Iaposll need to wear a special helmet all the time when Iaposm playing becauseI did get a knock to the head it would probably be catastrophic, especially while the skull hasnapost fully healed as I canapost have any contact. Even in the long run, I am now more susceptible to severe concussion. After the crash, Will was taken straight to Piedmont Hospital in Athens, Georgia, but as he started to recover, he was transferred to special brain and spinal cord injury unit, The Shepherd Centre, in Atlanta. Incredible video footage shows him relearning how to walk and even dribbling a football down the ward.    And despite not knowing what the long term effects of the brain injury are, the determined striker flies back out to Georgia to continue his scholarship - and canapost wait to get back on the pitch. Will said: After  days I was fully cognitive again but I had to be lted out of the bed because I was so weak and had to use a frame to be able to start walking again. At first I was frustrated but I met so many amazing people with dferent stories at the Shepherd Centre, and soon you realise no matter how bad you think you have it, somebody  has it much worse.

He was pictured after the billionaire had left the property – which victims described as being full of pornographic and bizarre ornaments – with another female who looked to be in her teens, shivering in a thin jumper while he wore a thick coat. The footage was shot in December , a day after the infamous image of Andrew with Epstein in the city’s Central Park, following his jail release. The park photo embarrassed Buckingham Palace as the Duke of York faced calls to explain why he had not broken links with his disgraced pal. And Buckingham Palace has been quick to deny claims two of Epstein’s alleged victims have made against him since.    But the new footage of Andrew at Epstein’s lair has piled pressure on him to finally come clean about their friendship. One question being asked is how the bizarre features in Epstein’s New York home did not seem to ring alarm bells. Visitors to the £million, nine-storey Manhattan property, which included a steady stream of young women, said it was as weird as Epstein himself – who talked of having his penis ­cryogenically frozen and seeding humanity with his DNA. The entry foyer where Andrew stood to wave off the brunette was decorated with rows of framed articial eyeballs. Close by hung an oil painting of ex-President Bill Clinton in red heels and the semen-stained blue dress that Monica Lewinsky wore when she performed a sex act on him. A chandelier had a le-size female doll hanging from it and his bathroom had prosthetic breasts on the wall so he could play with the nipples while he bathed. A creepy chessboard featured customised figurines modelled on his female staff, apparently dressed suggestively. Behind Epstein’s desk was a  painting by Kees van Dongen called Femme Fatale, showing a woman cupping her exposed left breast.     And another large painting showed Epstein himself in a prison surrounded by barbed wire and gun-toting guards – which he said was “to remind me I could go back to prison any time”. But Andrew apparently brushed off all these indications about Epstein, as he did when others asked him. In a  Vanity Fair article about his relationship with the pervert, a friend of the pair was quoted as saying: “I remember when Andrew and Jeffrey became friends. “Jeffrey had Andrew put on a pair of sweatpants for the first time. He had him wear blue jeans. It was Jeffrey who taught Andrew how to relax. After Jeffrey was convicted, I phoned Andrew and told him, ‘You cannot have a relationship with Jeffrey.’ And he said, ‘Stop giving me a hard time, you’re such a puritan.’  “Our conversation descended into a screaming match and Andrew said, ‘Leave me alone, Jeffrey’s my friend, being loyal to your friends is a virtue’.” Depraved Epstein died in custody nine days ago, aged , while being held on child sex-trafficking charges. His death has been ruled a suicide but this is still being disputed. He had faced trial next June,  years after he was jailed in Florida. In a sweetheart deal in  he admitted procuring an underage girl, aged , for prostitution. He got just  months. An alleged victim, aged , and her parents claimed Epstein molested her at his mansion in Palm Beach, where bathrooms were stocked with soaps shaped like male and female genitalia. Since the  Central Park photo emerged, two of Epstein’s alleged victims have accused Andrew of impropriety. “Sex slave” Virginia Giuffre, then Roberts, claimed she was “lent out” to the Duke for sex on three occasions – one of them in London. And Johanna Sjoberg had alleged that he groped her breast at Epstein’s New York home when she was . Ms Giuffre and Ms Sjoberg made their allegations against Andrew as part of a  Florida court filing. But a judge threw out the claims and ordered them struck from the record as “immaterial and impertinent”. Days before Epstein was found dead, a huge legal dossier containing the lurid allegations was unsealed.  Andrew’s lawyers reiterated their denials, saying: “It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is  and without foundation.” Buckingham Palace also said in  that “any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue”. But despite the repeated denials of wrongdoing, Andrew and the palace have yet to explain the photo of him with his arm around Ms Giuffre, then , in London in  – and why he did not sever his ties with Epstein once he was a ­registered sex offender. Andrew, , was introduced to Epstein in the s by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late, disgraced ­newspaper owner Robert. The -year-old was allegedly his fixer for young girls but she denies all claims and has never been arrested. Records detailing flights by Epstein’s private jet reveal that in May , Andrew flew to Palm Beach with him and Maxwell. A month later, Epstein and Maxwell are believed to have attended a bumper royal birthday bash at Windsor, marking Andrew’s th, Princess Anne’s th, Princess Margaret’s th and Prince William’s th. That autumn, Andrew was a guest at a Halloween “hookers and bondage” party in Manhattan, where Maxwell dressed as a prostitute. And in December that year, the Prince hosted a birthday party for Maxwell at Sandringham, which Epstein attended. All three then went to Thailand to celebrate the New Year. Other encounters between Andrew and Epstein are believed to have taken place at the Queen’s Norfolk estate and a dinner in Saint Tropez.

the sides prepare for cup tie","story":"Dundee host Aberdeen in the Betfred Cup on Sunday and, eventhe Dons have had a few early season problems, it’s fair to say anything other than a win for them would be a shock.On the back of relegation, James McPake’s Dark Blues are finding their feet after a major overhaul of the squad during the summer.It means they go into this tie as major underdogs, though history does tell us this is a competition in which Dundee are capable of upsetting the odds.Tonight Tele Sport looks back at a couple of occasions when they have – and some others when the result has been true to the form book.While unlike the present format, this tie was over two legs, it was similar to this clash in that Dundee had just been relegated at the end of the previous season.Aberdeen were at the peak of their powers under Alex Ferguson and, as reigning champions, a bigger knockout tie for them was a European Cup meeting with Liverpool around the same time.That they went out of that competition to the team that would eventually win it was no great surprise but losing to Dundee was.After a draw at Dens in the first leg, the feeling was Donald Mackay’s team were heading to the Granite City hoping for little more than to keep the score respectable.In the end, however, a battling performance saw them hold their own and progress to the semi-finals thanks to a Cammy Fraser strike.Dundee would go on to make the final before losing to city rivals United on a historic day at Dens Park.The only time the north-east rivals have faced up in a national final and it was Aberdeen who lted the trophy with a comfortable Hampden victory.Once again, the pair met with Dundee, under Jim Duffy, out of the top flight but going into the tie on the back of a fine unbeaten run that saw them riding high in the First Division and making the final.For those of a Dark Blue persuasion, however, it quickly became a day to forget as their team didn’t really show up.An effort from former Dens favourite Billy Dodds had Aberdeen ahead by the break and, when Duncan Shearer added a second right at the start of the second half, it was all over bar the shouting.Although Dundee were again in the second tier, with the backing of Aberdeen-based businessman Callum Melville, their strong line-up was always going to provide a stern test for the visiting Dons.So it proved as, despite losing experienced goalkeeper Rab Douglas through injury in the first half, Jocky Scott’s team pulled off the result of the round by winning in extra-time.Goals from Eddie Malone and Craig Forsyth had the home team apparently cruising but a double from Michael Paton saw the proceedings heading into extra-time.As the game ebbed and flowed, one of those Melville-backed signings, a young Leigh Grfiths, came up trumps with the winner.The last time the teams met in a League Cup tie saw Dundee still recovering from a second period of administration that had seen the team almost fold the previous year.Having performed a miracle in keeping the team in the First Division in the   season, boss Barry Smith was looking to pull off a shock at Pittodrie.They battled hard to give him the scalp he wanted but, on the night, came up just short.A tight tie was decided as early as the th minute when home attacker Darren Mackie grabbed the only goal."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44367193-240x180.jpg

to","story":"In the space of just three short weeks, Dundee boss James McPake has gone from famine to feast with striking options.The capture of fans favourite Kane Hemmings last Thursday has undoubtedly added to the goal threat from the Dark Blues this season, evenhe couldn’t mark his second debut by finding the net.He joined another new striker on the books in the shape of Danny Johnson, a signing from Motherwell a fortnight previously.Longer-serving Andrew Nelson and Craig Curran had both come in back in the January transfer window but, with only four goals between them before this season, it’s clear the manager needed to bring in goalscorers over the summer.Tonight Tele Sport takes a look at the feast of options at the manager’s disposal:Dee appearances:  Goals: Career apps:  Goals: Plenty has been written about the -year-old and even more is expected of him this season.There’s little doubt he’ll be able to shoulder the responsibility of leading the line for Dundee as they chase promotion back to the top flight.Having notched  goals in the Premiership last time he was at Dens Park and ed more experienced, Hemmings will be a big part of James McPake’s side this season.After leaving the Dark Blues in the summer of , the former Rangers kid has continually knocked in goals, in particular at Mansfield Town and Notts County in English League Two.Anything north of

notching a barrowload in English non-league football, most notably  in  games at Guisborough Town that earned him a move to Cardf.And he’s made a great start to le in dark blue with a winning goal on his debut at home to Inverness followed up by a double from the spot to earn a point at Dunfermline.He didn’t hit those heights again in the win over Ayr United but three goals from his first three games is a start any striker would be happy with.Dee apps:  Goals: Career apps:  Goals: The former Sunderland man burst on to the scene with a superb winner at Tynecastle last season.And he’s shown continually in his performances since that he can have a big future at Dens Park,he keeps fit.A flurry of energy at the top end of the park, Nelson makes le uncomfortable for defenders and has  goals in  matches in Scottish football – a very decentfor someone only just about to turn .And his winning goal in the important - victory over Ayr United at the weekend reminded everyone at Dens Park of his ability in front of goal.Dee apps:  Goals: Career apps:  Goals: He may have indicated his desire tosouth due to family reasons but McPake has insisted Curran will remain part of his plans until that happens.He’s never been a consistent goalscorer – his struggles in front of goal at Dundee are a clear example – but is a manager’s dream in terms of commitment, workrate and attitude.Likely to be behind the others in the pecking order, however,he remains at the club.Backing those four up is Michael Cunningham, a young man the Dark Blues have high hopes for.As it stands, Dundee’s strikers have  senior goals between them – a wealth of options for boss McPake to get his head

years old when she sat her Nat  exams in both maths and application of maths.This is despite her school, Braeview Academy, being affected by a blaze last year which saw classes joining both Craigie High and Baldragon Academy.The S pupil was first noticed as having a brain for maths while in P at Longhaugh Primary.After her teacher noticed this Hannah started to attend the P maths classes and when transition to high school she had already gained most of the knowledge required for the Nat  qualication.Now she is the first S pupil Braeview have ever presented for the Nat  exams and the first of any pupils to do both papers thanks to the help of principal teacher of maths Miss MacArthur and teachers Mrs McLaughlan and Mr Rew.Now, as she moves up to S, she will be working on her Higher maths qualication which is usually completed in S or S.Hannah said: “In primary school I just had a natural head for maths but I have had to work on it a lot as I have gotten older and towards the exams.“The Nat  maths are the standard maths which you would use to go on and do higher maths and the application of maths is more about le skills such as VAT, taxes, income, interest and budgets.“When I was told I was going to be doing the two Nat s I was really up for it, but after the fire I wasn’t sureI would manage it as my one-to-one support had been stopped and our lessons were sometimes a lot shorter.“We also had to be bussed to Craigie High so we missed out on periods one and seven every day.“It was also quite hard as we were in a new environment with dferent teachers, peers and classrooms, but the host schools were lovely.“I thought I might as well go for it though and thought I could do itI worked hard enough.”When the results came through the door earlier this

I watched them last Saturday and not only did we have to deal with a team motivated, playing with confidence and who had prepared all week, they were certainly ready for it. We turned up for the game and made the players aware of how dficult it would be, especially after playing with  men for so long on Thursday.“We were not brilliant. It was all about digging deep and getting the result.“Two weeks ago we left Pittodrie after beating Hearts - and everyone was euphoric.“Saying ‘this was the best team we had had in a while’ and we cannot go as high as that to as low as we were.“Dundee gave us a right game and made it dficult for us. As you know cup games are all about finding a way to win and my players deserve so much praise for that.“We’ll give them a few days off and then get back to some training days which we haven’t had the luxury of in recent weeks.“It takes luck, good players and quality but in any team there has to be a strength to dig out results.“For long spells it didn’t look like there was a goal in us but we made changes, took a risk by going man for man at the back and thankfully we had enough bodies at both goals to get the reward.“A lot of people would have taken pleasure in seeing us go out of the cup and I have a lot of pleasure in seeing my team go through.“I know we can improve, be far more slicker and more technical, and I know we’ll have more energy in our legs.“There are certain games where you need grit and determination and we had that.”Considine conceded the penalty for a foul on Jordon Forster, but redeemed himself with the equaliser.McInnes added: “If Andy has conceded a penalty he has certainly made up for it.“It was a real dagger to the hearts of the Dundee players late on and we looked more equipped to get the second goal and once we got it we managed to get over the line without too much fuss.”McInnes’ celebrations for both his team’s goals were a mixture of relief and jubilation, in many ways mirroring the emotions of the Red Army who had travelled to Dens.He said: “Our fans were put through the mill. They came here with high expectations and it wasn’t playing out as they expected.“We have to credit Dundee for that. You just become like a supporter.“You just feel that elation and relief.“It was relief and sheer pleasure on my part at seeing my players having to dig deep and winning.“Funso Ojo, Shay Logan, Greg Leigh, Scott McKenna and Andy Considine had nothing left at the end but they were still putting everything in.”Dundee boss James McPake said: “I’m proud but I expect my team to be like that.“That type of performance has been coming for a while but I’m devastated for them and the fans.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44726701-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44726701-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44726701-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44726701-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dons defeat dundee after extra time at dens park","story":"Aberdeen produced a dramatic comeback at Dens Park to defeat Dundee - and reach the Betfred Cup quarter-finals.The Dons required extra-time to get past Championship opposition in the City of Discovery.Danny Johnson had put Dundee in front from the penalty spot just before half-time.It looked asthere wasn#t going to be a route back into the tie for Derek McInnes# men. but Andy Considine equalised in injury time and Sam Cosgrove grabbed the winner in extra-time.Aberdeen will tackle Hearts at Tynecastle in the last-eight of the League Cup.The Reds# only change from Thursday#s - Europa League loss to Rijeka at Pittodrie was summer signing Craig Bryson coming in for his first start in midfield with Lewis Ferguson suspended.Dundee enjoyed the better of the first half and had a couple of decent chances to open the scoring in the first quarter.On  minutes Declan McDaid crossed from the left and Josh Todd sent the ball just wide at the back post from close range.Six minutes later it was the woodwork which thwarted the Championship outfit.Jamie Ness rolled a pass into Johnson who turned Considine on the edge of the area, but the striker#s left foot shot struck the right post and bounced clear.Aberdeen also survived a penalty shoot for apparent handball by midfielder Funso Ojo before falling behind a minute from the interval.Considine pulled Jordon Forster to the deck at a free-kick from Ness, ref WIllie Collum  pointed to the penalty spot and Johnson made no mistake from  yards finding the bottom right corner.The Dons started the second period at a higher tempo with Sam Cosgrove shooting wide soon after the break and Jon Gallagher#s low effort straight at keeper Jack Hamilton in the rd minute.Dundee remained stubborn in defence and with Aberdeen looking to push on in the closing stages showed they could be a threat on the counter-attack with McDaid#s dipping shot from  yards just over.The Reds could have levelled with eight minutes left when sub Connor McLennan was released down the right, he cut inside and had a shot blocked with Gallagher heading the loose ball towards goal and Jordon Forster clearing off the line.Just when it looked like that might be that Aberdeen saved themselves in the first of four added minutes. Ojo#s free-kick was met powerfully by the head of Greg Leigh, Hamilton made a save ing to his right, but Gallagher played the ball back across goal and Considine managed to force it home from a couple of yards.After the boost forcing extra time you expected Aberdeen to be stronger in the additional period and they were.Two minutes before half-time in extra time they hit the front when Leigh got to the bye-line down the left and his deep cross found Cosgrove at the back post and the striker headed down and into the bottom left corner.In the second half of extra time Dundee threw everything at the Dons, but they held firm to get through.Dundee: Jack Hamilton, Cammy Kerr, Jordan McGhee, Jordon Forster, Jordan Marshall, Josh Todd , Shaun Byrne, Finlay Robertson , Jamie Ness , Declan McDaid, Danny Johnson .Subs not used: Calum Ferrie, Max Anderson, Michael Cunningham.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Shay Logan, Andy Considine, Scott McKenna, Greg Leigh, Funso Ojo, Craig Bryson , Jon Gallagher , Ryan Hedges , Niall McGinn , Sam Cosgrove.Subs not used: Tomas Cerny, Scott Wright, Curtis Main."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d56a87ed27784.09048423-399x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet could rehome any of these animals1808","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.Brilliant by name, brilliant by nature!He is such a happy boy who loves to be the centre of attention.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"pipe band travels to worlds in hairstyle","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +styleviaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAll roads lead to Glasgow Green this weekend as the World Pipe Band Championships are held in the city.Mid Argyll Pipe Band will be heading to  compete in the Grade A arena, with realistic hopes of bringing home a trophy.And, for the second year running, Icon Hairdressers in Lochgilphead has sponsored a band bus to the championship.Pipe Major Craig Lang said: #We are very grateful to Icon Hairdressers for their generosity, and we look forward to a good world championships at the weekend.#The worlds will be the band#s penultimate competition of the year, with Cowal Games to follow in Dunoon at the end of August.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

We knew it would last forever, but forever had its day.The Twin Peaks-inspired Love Dilation is as dark as it is atmospheric.But it is perhaps the utterly engrossing simplicity of Imprints that makes it so special. While McAndrew has the harmonic range, Smalls almost monotoned meanderings, accompanied by the backing vocals of Grant Pringle and Cameron Jack, creates the rawest of emotions.Concluding the new EP is the orchestral art-song, A Theory of Everything. Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace. For the imprints you leave, have changed the fabric of time and space.If there is any justice in the supersonic space-age future, Electron Masss four EPs will hopefully have changed the fabric of

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

They have got the choice of three roads. The first is the C, which is impossible. Somebody would get killed every day.ldquoThe second is the Lowood Bridge and that is unsuitable.ldquoIf anybody is on that bridge, how will a -tonne lorry be able to pass  If it tried to squeeze through, it would hit the people and would crush them.ldquoThe other option is bringing the traffic through the town and the community of Galashiels does not want that.ldquoThe roads were not built for that use. It is dangerous.ldquoThere never has been a route proposed on this application and there is still not one to this day.ldquoSo how could it have been approved, without knowing where the traffic is going Melrose community councillor Mr Douglas claimed SBC was ldquounnecessarily endangering the publicrsquos lives and putting financial expedience before public safety in a letter to council chief executive Tracey Logan.And he asked to see a copy of a lsquopre-planning application decisionrsquo on potential vehicle routes.But, in a response, Ms Logan said: ldquoI have been advised no such document exists.She added the council had considered a transport statement and a report from the public consultation process.However, she admitted: ldquoNo detail of vehicle routes was included within either document. This was principally because at the time of the planning application, the contract for removing and treating wasted had not yet been awarded, meaning that the end destination was not known.ldquoThe council has recently awarded the contract for waste recycling to Levenseat, a company based near Forth in North Lanarkshire. Levenseat will consider dferent routes at dferent times of the day, depending on circumstances such as traffic.... We anticipate Levenseat will determine the best routes over the coming weeks.An SBC spokesperson added: ldquoThe number of trips to the waste transfer station is largely in line with trips to the previous landfill site, and signicantly less than could have been generated by an integrated waste management facility at Easter Langlee.ldquoAs part of the planning application which was approved in November , the council committed to improving the road network through additional street-lighting, better signage, localised road widening and removal of trees and vegetation, all of which have taken place.ldquoThe council was not able to define a route during the planning process as the procurement exercise had not been completed and therefore SBC did not know the end destination or the preferred route.ldquoThe new residual waste contract will see the majority of the waste treated to produce a refuse derived fuel ndash to generate heat and electricity ndash as well as recover materials which can be recycled.ldquoThe closure of the landfill site and opening of waste transfer station will also see a reduction in harmful greenhouse gases from landfilling the waste and we believe it will also result in an improved recycling performance."},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-set-17th-annual-music-festival","story":"INNERLEITHEN is ready to rock this weekend as it welcomes musicians, dancers and performers to the towns th annual music festival.The StRonans Hotel and Live  Local at the Vale Club have put together a jam-packed programme of bands overthree days.And the Church of Scotland, Tweedside Hotel, Masons Club and the Union Club are all set to host a number of events.The music kicks off on Friday at pm in the St Ronanrsquos Hotel with the Redwood Rejects, at pm with Fin Price at lsquoLive  Localrsquo and at pm with Sparky  The Choirboys at the Tweedside Hotel.On Saturday, alongside the full programmes of bands around Innerleithen, the town is packed with events, starting with the St Ronanrsquos Silver Band coffee morning.Afterwards, the band will be continuing their eight-hour sponsored play out and about in the town.At the Church of Scotland therersquos concerts galore with The Taylor Family  Friends, Borders piper Matt Seattle accompanied by guitarist Donald Knox, and superb Innerleithen-born singer-songwriter Tommy Ashby.Over at the Masons, the regions favourite cover band The Derivatives are appearing, while Rory Speirs is at the Tweedside.There will be something for all the family to enjoy, with a wide selection of workshops, including beginnerrsquos ballet and line dance with the Fiona Henderson School of Dance, as well as singing, belly-dancing and an introduction to ukelele.There will also be an opportunity to learn more about the town on a historical walk with local experts from the Innerleithen Community Trust.Sunday sees the music continue over at the Church of Scotland, with a concert by leading Scots folk singer Christine Kydd, supported by the Borders Gaelic singing group lsquoTurasrsquo and Folksters.And to round off the weekend, therersquos informal music sessions at the Gordon Arms and the Corner House hotels.One of the festivals organisers, Robin Dempsey said: ldquoWe are really excited that we have possibly our biggest ever line up, with around  performances and events on the programme, spread over eight venues.ldquoThe music festival is truly encouraging local talent in the community and it is great to see so many locals and visitors coming together to share their love of music.ldquoWhat has really helped this year is support from our new sponsor, private development group, Whiteburn, who are currently regenerating the former Caerlee Mill site in the town.

Despite the great effort, the match ended in a - defeat.Jack McNab played a blinder over the weekend with smashing runs on both days.Coaches commented: #This has been a fantastic opportunity for the team and the Edinburgh Cup set out and proved exactly what we wanted to achieve and that was to sample experienced teams at -a-side.#We learned a lot from the weekend and are chuffed to say the team did the town proud during their first proper transition to the -a-side game where the Us have secured a place in Glasgow and District Youth Football League nd ision.#Fundraising efforts for the trip included Helen Gilchrist running a children#s quiz, a full day#s spinning by squad members in Campbeltown Coop, a successful bag pack in Campbeltown Tesco, a very successful tombola and baking stall at their own festival, generous donations from the Coop  and Laggan Community Council, a sibling of one of the Tarbert players holding a coffee morning in her local nursing home, the Kinloch Bar running ious football cards and a darts charity event along with generous donations from parents and grandparents.The Us appreciate every penny raised to get them to the tournament.Leftover funds went towards a framed photo of the team, by the Edinburgh Cup photographer, for each player plus player of the tournament gts which the coaches decided should be awarded to Jack McNab and Imogen Todd, who displayed some excellent saves throughout the festival, and a small keyring for coaches Rhys Blair, Dougue Renton and Robert Todd.Organisers would also like to thank Mairi MacMillan and Robert Graham for accompanying them on the trip, all the fundraisers, CDJFA for supporting their efforts and also Kintyre Sports Council for the use of the bus.#We wish the Us all the best in their first year of the Glasgow League who secured strip sponsorship from local businesses Donald Mclean contractors and Munch.#Photographs show pictures of the team, yellow T-shirts purchased through fundraising and one in their red strips and one of CDJFA player Jake McEachran who played for Port Glasgow on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"competition heats up on stronvaar green","story":"The tournament was well supported by the two local clubs and others from mid-Argyll and beyond and the round robin sections of four matches were keenly contested.The semi-finals featured two triples from CBC, Argyll BC and Vale of Leven BC, and these resulted in a final between Campbeltown’s Steven Dickson, Neil Maguire and Hugh Newlands and Vale’s Colin McIntyre, Grant MacLeod and Robert Scott.A good crowd gathered around the green to watch the match and saw the Vale trio take control with MacLeod the stand-out performer gaining the shots that mattered to give his team a decisive win.President Bobby Dalziel thanked Archie and Tracy for their generous sponsorship of the event and invited them to present the trophy and prizes."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils stay cool to catch late winner","story":"Campbeltown Pupils applied the perfect finish to their pre-season preparations with a hard-fought win over Rhu.Having been regular visitors to the Caledonian League side’s summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

It is an intimate world, personal and subjective, the world of our thoughts and feelings. Children live in it quite naturally, but as adults we tend to withdraw from it.#I use high-key expressionist colour to express how I feel about the landscape.#I’ve been painting the area around me now for over  years, and the more I paint Knapdale, the more intensely I use light and colour to express my emotions for the landscape.#John worked for  years as an art teacher at Lochgilphead High School, then in art education with Strathclyde Region before leaving work to paint full-time in .His distinctive colourful landscapes quickly made him one of the Scotland’s most successful painters, with celebrities such as Sting, Madonna, Simon Le Bon and Gregor Fisher collecting his work.Wilma Meikle, who owns the Archway Gallery with her husband Iain, said: #We’re delighted that John has supported the gallery for all these years. His exhibition is always the highlight of our year and the new paintings are amazing.#It’s also really nice to have a show which is relevant to this area.

This is standard, legal practice. Safety is our number one priority when arranging home to school transport.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe are working with colleagues across the council and in schools to ensure that all pupils who have been issued with a bus pass are on the transport providersrsquo lists and to improve access to the school transport timetables.ldquoWe recognise that this may have caused uncertainty for parents, carers and pupils.ldquoOur staff and the transport providers will continue to work closely together to manage the transition to these new arrangements.Councillor Craig Hoy, ward member, said: ldquoI was relieved to get clear reassurance from council staff on the issues of vehicle safety and the safety of children travelling from Gford and outlying areas to Knox Academy.ldquoItrsquos clear that there were communications problems which impacted parents and pupils. Managing this sort of process is never easy, but the council and operators should try to learn from this experience before any future changes to bus operators or routes."},{"url":null,"title":"lightning-strikes-house-east-lothian-drenched-storm","story":"Torrential rain led to flooding in many parts of the county, with floodwaters just minutes away from flowing into homes before subsiding just in time.In Prestonpans, the police and fire service rushed to Dolphingstone View after a two-storey terraced house was struck by several bolts of lightning, causing a ruptured gas main and a fire in the roof at pm on Saturday evening.Fire engines from Dalkeith, Tollcross, Musselburgh and McDonald Road in Edinburgh were called out to the scene, along with police.Amanda Milne lives next door to the house that was struck by the lightning.She told the Courier: ldquoThe strike set fire to their attic and also the gas box that we all have outside our front doors.ldquoWe knew when the lightning struck that it hit something nearby as it lit up the sky and went out with a huge bang louder than the rest of them.ldquoOur power went off straight away and at that point it was quite scary, especially with a petried toddler and dog.Amandarsquos partner, Murray McKeown, took her and -month-old Ollie to his motherrsquos house as they were evacuated from their home when the fire engines arrived.She added: ldquoMy partner got us in the car and drove us somewhere safe until the firefighters put the fire out and the gas men had done their checks.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached.

Last October, the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry mooted a ldquodemocratic event would suffice iethe SNP simply won the most Scottish seats at a general election, independence would follow.Having had their bid rejected, Mr MacNeil and Mr McEleny are now trying a dferent route tabling an amendment to an accepted conference motion on devolution.It says a ldquopro-independence electoral victory shall be a mandate from the people of Scotland to commence independence negotiations with the UK Government,Westminster refused to grant the Scottish Government the power to hold a second referendum.:SNPs Jeane Freeman must inject urgency into -month superhospital probe to protect patientsYet the First Minister wants any decision by Scotland to break free from the UK to be fair, legal and decisive, which was the basis of the  vote as per the Edinburgh Agreement.She insists on the back of the Holyrood vote in , she has a mandate to hold a second referendum and has earmarked the latter part of next year to hold it.But there is one big problem: London says no.If the polls are right ndash two recent ones put the Tories  points clear of Labour ndash then should Boris Johnson make good his promise to lead Britain out of the EU in daysrsquo time, the chances of a snap general election are high. The Prime Minister will be banking on the backers of Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party swinging behind the Tories and giving him a working majority. The Tory manesto would doubtless again include a line about refusing Ms Sturgeonrsquos desire to hold a second independence referendum.Mr Johnson, just like Theresa May before him, will not agree to one because he does not believe the SNP Government has a mandate it does not have a Holyrood majority and, until it does, all bets are off.The Tory Government can do this because Westminster remains the constitutional authority.The PM, given the turmoil of Brexit, needs a new battle on another front like a hole in the head, so will keep saying no. Indeed,the Tories were to win a snap election in November, the next general election would not be due until late .So, is there anything Ms Sturgeon can do to get round this constitutional impasse  Possibly.:Jeremy Corbynrsquos plan to be caretaker prime minister receives further blowUnionist MPs have spotted a potential albeit circuitous route, which is causing some of them a deal of concern.To get to her desired destination, the FM needs that parliamentary majority in Edinburgh to knock aside Whitehallrsquos argument that the SNP administration does not have a mandate.But the next Holyrood election is not until . So, a second referendum next year is impossible, right  Wrong.Section  of the  Scotland Act has two ways to facilitate what is known as an ldquoextraordinary general election in Scotland. The first looks impossible having a two-thirds majority of MSPs to call a new poll. This would mean getting most Labour MSPs to back the idea which will not happen.The alternative route, however, would involve Ms Sturgeon resigning her role.There would be a month to find a new FM. But with the pro-independence Greens, the SNP has an overall majority at Holyrood and so could block anyone filling the role. An extraordinary general election would, therefore, follow. And,Ms Sturgeonrsquos gamble paid off, the SNP would get its majority in the Scottish Parliament.One could argue this is an extremely risky action because there are no guarantees the FM would secure a parliamentary majority.ButBritain faces either a bad or a no-deal Brexit outcome with all the negative consequences people fear would follow, she might, in extremis, have to consider all possibilities, including the ldquonuclear option of collapsing her own government.If she got her new mandate, Ms Sturgeon could turn around to Mr Johnson and say: ldquoGive me my referendum.Last week, even staunch Unionist David Mundell, the former Scottish Secretary, conceded that it would be \"hard to push back\" against a second polla Holyrood election was ldquofought explicitly on the issue of another referendum and then there is a majority of nationalist parties for it.The interesting reference was ldquonationalist parties. At the last Holyrood election the SNP and Greens stood on dferent s butthey were to come together to put indyref front and centre ndash as they presumably would in an extraordinary general election to force another poll ndash then the chances of getting that nationalist majority would be so much higher.In terms of time under this unorthodox route,the FM resigned at the start of , her desired second chance poll could indeed take place in the autumn of next year.One Conservative MP noted that by collapsing her government, the SNP leader would ldquooptimise her chances of having a second poll. ldquoIf she gets a majority, I couldnrsquot see how the PM could refuse another independence referendum.A Liberal Democrat MP also raised concerns at the prospect, stressing: ldquoThis is why itrsquos so important to stop Brexit, so we donrsquot allow it to break up the UK.An SNP MP said the option of Ms Sturgeon resigning to force a snap Holyrood election was an ldquointeresting route to get to indyref.ldquoShe might do it, he declared, noting: ldquoThe more unreasonable the UK Government is, the better. And they are being fantastically unreasonable at the moment. Something has to give.However, a senior Nationalist close to the SNP leader said while she was well aware of the Scotland Act option, it was ldquonot in our thinking. At the moment.A UK Government source was dismissive. ldquoIf Nicola Sturgeon launched a cynical attempt to engineer another referendum, it would go down extremely badly with the majority of Scots, who do not want one in the foreseeable future.Of course, evenMs Sturgeon were to win a majority in a  extraordinary general election in Scotland, Mr Johnson could dig in his heels, raise his nose and simply say no.And, indeed,he were to win a snap UK general election on a manesto of rejecting indyref until November  at the earliest, he could simply respond to the SNP leaderrsquos demand by saying: ldquoTough.

Not surprisingly most of them are to do with the music. There are the ordinary tour nights, some nights better than others, and then there are the nights when the song and the set steps out of normal touring routine and connects in a very powerful way. The energy, spiritual resonance and audience interaction hit the heights and it all becomes a very intoxicating symphony.One particular highlight for me will always be performing our Gaelic song An Ubhal As Airde on Top Of The Pops.

The quango found as few as , owners ndash from Highland lairds to state forestry enterprises ndash own some % of Scotlandrsquos rural land, around  million hectares.The Scottish Government has said something like % of the country as a whole is in the hands of large private estates. Another .% belongs to the state, in one guise or another.Previously, the now Green MSP Andy Wightman had calculated that fewer than  people owned half of all land in private hands.Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen and the Duke of Buccleuch ndash the biggest private landowners ndash each own more than , acres, thought not in single blocks.Some of the names might have changed, a foreign billionaire replacing a Highland clan chief or a TV star selling up to a merchant banker. But the basic proportion of ownership, campaigners say, has not changed for decades.Landowners do not have to be bad for that to be a problem, Hamish Trench, chief executive of the Scottish Land Commission, said back in March. ldquoThat is an unhealthy position to be in, he concluded. Britainrsquos monopolies quango told the SLC there could be grounds for breaking up such concentrations of ownership, including by state entities like the Forestry Commission.But it is not for the want of trying that ownership has changed so little. Because there is another kind of owner, still a relatively new kind: the community collective.Around % of Scotland belongs to a community land company. The first estate to be bought out was in Assynt, in western Sutherland, in .There followed dozens more. Prizes, over the years, included the isolated peninsula of Knoydart, the island of Eigg and the woods of Rhubodach on Bute.After devolution, successive governments in Edinburgh have sought to help communities to take over land, with money, and law. That has not always gone down well.In , the then Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition secured legislation under which communities got the legal right to buy land when it went on sale. Conservatives voted against the move. Right-wing tabloids were furious: it was, the refrain quickly went, a ldquoMugabe-style land grab.This line ndash that reforms were reminiscent of the gangs of black farmers who seized the property of white farmers under the Zimbabwean strongman ndash was to thrive.It was repeated again in  when a new government, now the SNP, suggested further reforms.William Astor, Lord Astor, the father-in-law of the then prime minister, David Cameron, wrote a polemic in The Spectator using the same ldquoMugabe land grab line. The Conservative peer owns a chunk of Jura through a trust based in the Bahamas.Rhetoric did not stop the SNP getting through a new reform act in . This one would, in theory, give the government the power to force an owner to sell up to the community.Its headline new power has still to be enacted. The Scottish Land Commission, in its report back in March, recommended the use of such powers, including a public interest test on whether large landholdings should face compulsory dismemberment.And so the debate has raged, with a community buyout movement on one side and resistant landowners, represented by the lobby Scottish Land  Estates, on the other. To outsiders, it looks like a war of attrition.The SNP has stressed community land buyouts are not a panacea. Many, after all, have struggled.Debaters have been coy. Few want to say out loud that some communities lack human capacity. Given the size of some places ndash whether small islands or sparsely populated giant estates ndash it is probably unfair to expect them to have all the skills required to run community businesses. Nor should they be expected to. That is why there are ndash and must be ndash support mechanisms in place.Some buyouts suffer acrimonious fallouts. Some fail to deliver, as we report today on Bute. Other schemes face a legacy issue. What happens when a few champions of a buyout retire, or die  How do small communities plan and ensure a continuity of quality, accountable leadership.Humans are human. And, of course, large private estates do not necessarily deliver either. However, given some of these projects have received large sums of public money, we must ensure there is full and proper scrutiny.The Land Commission and policymakers also want to encourage more smaller estates and farms, more job-creating agribusinesses. The official mantra is that a balanced ownership is needed.There will always be rows over policy. But ndash given the frailty of some of our remotest communities ndash has the time not come to take stock of land buyouts Whatever the theoretical merits, are we sure we are getting enough of them right  And how do we ensure that we do "},{"url":null,"title":"POLITICS WATCH  How to bin friends and influence people","story":"arrives on his first foreign visit as Prime Minister, they could do worse than study what happened on the steps of Bute House when he met First MinisterNicola Sturgeon.

Even these talks, the first face to face encounters since he became PM, will not linger long on Brexit.

It was a Civil Service look at likely scenarios, a heads up from cool, impartial heads. Only those who no longer believe in the Civil Servicersquos impartiality on Brexit would downplay the warnings.Instead of dismissing the coverage as outdated scaremongering, the government should have issued an update on current planning. Why are the plans being cloaked in such secrecythey are purely practical steps that any reasonable administration would take  Contrary to some of the language of recent weeks, we are not at war.Instead, Downing Street chose to focus on the bossrsquos meetings with European leaders. Even these talks, the first face to face encounters since he became PM, will not linger long on Brexit. The new position, the Chancellor and the President will be told, is that a new deal is the only alternative to no deal, and there is nothing the British parliament can do to stop the latter. This is politics as declaration, not negotiation.Since neither Mr Macron nor Mrs Merkel have any intention to reopen talks on the Withdrawal Agreement, they too will be keen to join Mr Johnson in looking ahead to G business. So the most important matter facing the UK will be all but ignored when the British PM meets the two people in the EU who have the clout to change things.: MPs in cross party demand for recallFrosty meetings will play well with the Brexiteers back home. Unlike his previous trips as Foreign Secretary, which largely consisted of him travelling to places and being confronted with asinine words he had said about his now host, the Boris Johnson on parade in Berlin and Paris will be the sombre statesman, the more in sorrow than in anger PM, giving Europe one last chance to do the \"right\" thing.The pictures he is most interested in are not those with Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron, but the ones with Mr Trump and the premiers of Canada and Japan at the G. In Biarritz he will be posing as Boris Johnson, the leader of a outward-looking powerhouse keen to get going on global trade deals.

These included areas with houses, roads, restricted areas due to military or political reasons, as well as terrains not suitable for wind power generation.Turkey, Russia, and Norway have the greatest potential for future wind power density, according to the study.Large parts of Western Europe were also considered ripe for further onshore farms because of favourable wind speeds and flat areas.Peter Enevoldsen, assistant professor in the Centre For Energy Technologies at Aarhus University, said: ldquoCritics will no doubt argue the naturally intermittent supply of wind makes onshore wind energy unsuitable to meet the global demand.ldquoBut even without accounting for developments in wind turbine technology in the upcoming decades, onshore wind power is the cheapest mature source of renewable energy, and utilising the dferent wind regions in Europe is the key to meet the demand for a  percent renewable and fully decarbonised energy system.Mark Jacobson, Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, America, said the study would allow better planning across Europe.He said: ldquoOne of the most important findings of this study ndash aside from the fact it concludes the European onshore wind potential is larger than previously estimated ndash is that it facilitates the ability of countries to plan their onshore wind resource development more efficiently, so easing the way for commitments by these countries to move entirely to clean, renewable energy for all purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"focus-past-glasgows-dark-era-revealed-haunting-images","story":"Laundry flutters on lines strung across dank alleys that would rarely,ever, capture the sun. A child in what seems to be a bowler hat tucked over his ears clutches a jug in his arms almost as big as he is, and a curious face juts through a tenement window, perhaps anxious to see what the man with the camera might be doing in a grim Glasgow close.These evocative images are among hundreds of Glasgow scenes captured by th-century photographer Thomas Annan, as he meticulously recorded a city undergoing social and structural changes intended to help end the squalor and deprivation, and usher in a new way of le.Many of Annanrsquos photographs shed light on the east endrsquos harsh past, where slum le came to an early end at an average age of just  and the stinking closes and wynds harboured homes crammed with dozens of people sharing the most basic of living conditions.Other images cast light on the effort to raise the cityrsquos living standards ndash such as the pivotal waterworks project that fed clean water from Loch Katrine to the heart of the city.The photographs and Annanrsquos remarkable work is now set to be explored at a sold-out event organised by the Alexander Thomson Society, which is to be held at the Kelvin Hall later this month.According to art historian Anne Lyden, of the National Galleries of Scotland, who will present the event, Annanrsquos fascinating images reflect a time long gone but also serve as a reminder that modern le is not immune from challenges and a constant need for the city to evolve.ldquoAnnanrsquos photographs are interesting because they are a moment when change was already starting to happen in the city, she says. ldquoHe started work in , two years after the Glasgow City Improvements Act and the earlier Police Act were bringing about change and trying to improve conditions.ldquoThere was improved lighting and sanitation. However, the city fathers decided it would be better to completely demolish and start over again.As a result, many of Annanrsquos images show closes and tenements that would go on to be razed, with families displaced and new buildings erected in their place.Some, however, such as an image of the Saltmarket taken in  from Bridgegate, feel almost familiar, save for the eerie figures that line the cobbled street, many with their unsmiling faces turned to the photographerrsquos lens.Many of Annanrsquos photographs, a signicant number of which capture the overcrowded heart of the city, were commissioned by the Glasgow City Improvement Trust with the distinct aim of recording ldquoOld Glasgow before it was demolished.ldquoThe photographs demonstrate the challenges of a shting city and how urban planners have to constantly evaluate what is available for a changing demographic, adds Ms Lyden. ldquoWhen Thomas Annan was documenting these parts of Glasgow, there was a huge movement of people from the north of Scotland and Ireland coming to the city. At one point there were , Irish people living in that area.ldquoSimilar issues are being dealt with today in terms of managing housing stock.Annan took scores of photographs of old closes, tenements and wynds at a time when the compact city centre was home to more than , people. But his work also shed fascinating light on the cityrsquos industrial heritage, including images of work to dredge areas of the Clyde and of grand houses also facing demolition for new housing schemes and roads ndash just as the grim closes were being destroyed to make way for improved accommodation.The extraordinary clarity of many of the -year-old images, taken at a time when photography was still in its infancy, are testament to Annanrsquos technical skill, adds Ms Lyden.ldquoHe was incredibly skilled. The clarity in his images is because he was working with glass plate negatives. He was able to capture a tremendous amount of detail and was able to use dferent processes that he had travelled to Vienna to achieve the rights to use.ldquoHis photographs are evidence of a time past, but also reflect a lot of the same issues that we are dealing with today.Anne Lyden on Thomas Annan is at the Kelvin Hall on Wednesday, August ,at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"reversing-march-time-horology","story":"The watchmakerrsquos art faded with the arrival of quartz and battery-operated timepieces. Digital technology and more recently the continual buzz and beep of smartwatches replaced the traditional mechanical watch, with its skeleton of minuscule screws and intricate moving parts.Even the sprawling Timex factory in Dundee, which at its peak employed more than  people making timepieces to send around the world, couldnrsquot survive the march of time.But times have certainly changed, it seems the gentle art of making wristwatches is now enjoying an albeit small but still remarkable Scottish-led revival.In a workshop at Glasgow Green, ten handmade watches a week are being laboriously crafted, each featuring a prized enamelling technique typically only found in a very select few high-end watchmakersrsquo in Switzerland and Japan.Surrounded by shelves heaving with jewel-coloured enamelling powders, one of horologyrsquos trickiest creative processes ndash the making enamel watch dials in the lsquogrand feursquo tradition, and the task of constructing each watch by hand ndash is being undertaken with painstaking attention to detail.As a result, anOrdain watches with their richly coloured enamel dials ndash made by laying glass powders onto a blank copper disc, firing at high temperatures to melt the powder, cooling it and then firing over and over again to reach the required depth - are flying from his Glasgow workshop.Incredibly, hersquos found some are almost instantly sold on the second-hand market for twice their original four-figure price.One of the beauties of the enamel technique is the depth of colour that comes from multiple layers of glass. ldquoThe melted glass will never, ever lose its colour. It is much better quality than a painted dial that you canrsquot get anywhere , he says.ldquoThere are so few people in the world that can do this, and no-one involved in watchmaking expects a Scottish company to be doing it.But itrsquos not the only Glasgow watch studio seeing rising demand. At design studio Instrmnt in Parnie Street, design team Pete Sunderland and Ross Baynhamrsquos Swiss-movement timepieces have broken into the Japanese market ndash home to some of the biggest watchmaking brands in the world such as Seiko, Citizen and Casio.While celebrities may seek out expensive designer brands to showcase their wealth, Mr Sunderland says others are shting towards a more low-key and unique style statement.ldquoA lot of people are buying watches that donrsquot have that obvious branding they want people to have to ask what brand of watch they are wearing, he says.The firm is now preparing to expand beyond its quartz collection to include traditional mechanical watches and is eyeing the South Korean market.Even the lsquoheritagersquo end of the market appears to be thriving. Alness-based pocket watch business Dalvey has seen such demand for its classic timepieces soar to such an extent that it has recently revived production of classic Albert pocket watch chains, a throwback to the businessrsquos Victorian roots.Mr Heath believes demand for classic wristwatches is being partly driven by people turning away from technology and the constant lsquopingrsquo of text, email and step counters emanating from mobile phones and smartwatches.ldquoPeople are looking for something that will last forever ndash there are very few things in le that are used so much but will be there after you are gone. Itrsquos a very reassuring thing to have, he said.ldquoThey donrsquot have apps or make noises, so you can go for a walk and your watch isnrsquot vibrating, telling you to check emails or texts.The art of grand feu enamelling in watchmaking is carried out by only a tiny handful of highly sophisticated watchmakers in the world because of the highly precise nature of the work and time taken to produce each piece. They include Hermes, which recently launched a grand feu enamel version of its classic Slim DrsquoHermes watches, which instantly added almost pound, to the price tag.In the case of anOrdianrsquos watches, each .mm dial consists of several layers of glass which must be delicately sanded to absolute perfection ndash the slightest kink or warp is discarded. The challenge of conquering the technique took Heath and his team of enamellers almost three years to perfect.The watches are then carefully constructed by one of Scotlandrsquos few watchmakers who, bizarrely, learned the craft by taking a British Horological Institute distance learning course while working as a picker in Amazon.Alan Burtoft of the British Horological Institute says there appears to be a sht in how many consumers are choosing their watch, boosting the once disappearing art of the watchmaker.ldquoWe have seen a steady increase in interest in people looking to learn about watchmaking and clockmaking.ldquoIt may be because people are realising you can make quite a good living from repairing clocks and watches, but there also seems to be a resurgence in interest in mechanical timepieces.ldquoIt could be that people are just fed up with novelty and lsquothrowawayrsquo watches and want something that they can keep."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-attends-church-service-aberdeenshire","story":"She arrived at Crathie Kirk, near Balmoral Castle, on Sunday morning, along with the Earl and Countess of Wessex, who are known as the Earl and Countess of Forfar while in Scotland.Members of the royal family are currently spending their summer holidays at their estate in the north-east of Scotland, as is tradition.The small Church of Scotland parish kirk is their regular place of worship when they are at Balmoral."},{"url":null,"title":"jihadi-jack-parents-condemn-javid","story":"Jack Letts was  when he left his Oxfordshire home to join the Islamic State terror group in Syria in .Letts, who held dual UK-Canadian nationality, was jailed after Kurdish forces captured him as he tried to flee to Turkey in May .The -year-olds parents, John Letts and Sally Lane, told Channel  News the British Government was \"shirking responsibility and passing the buck off to the Canadians\".Mr Letts, , told the broadcaster: \"Justice doesnt seem to be able to happen here.\"I thought British citizens had certain rights.

They want people to love living and working around the farms but they also know it can be dficult to retain staffthere is hardly any accommodation and what there is, is ropey.Among the new tenants in the Wester Ross Fisheries homes will be young graduates, attracted to Ullapool partly because there was good accommodation to go with an interesting job.These are just the sort of people to help revitalise remote rural communities that the Scottish Government wants to attract.After all, it is only going to be with young people living and working in Scotlandrsquos fragile rural areas that these places are going to have a proper future.One young graduate, working on the salmon farm off the Isle of Muck, says there are also other problems which affect people in the islands, problems most people in urban Scotland donrsquot understand.ldquoTherersquos no such thing as popping to Tesco for a pint of milk, she said.There is no shop on Muck so all food has to be brought over by boat. It is the same for fuel, which means there has to be good organising and stockpiling, plans which go awry when the ferries donrsquot arrive.Then there is broadband. Many of Scotlandrsquos salmon companies have pioneered the installation of superfast internet connections, often using fibreoptic cables, for remote communities.Last year, Scottish Sea Farms worked with broadband provider HebNet CIC to install superfast cover for the residents of the remote Knoydart peninsula and Loch Nevis.Mowi has done the same across the small isles of Muck and Rum, moves which have gone a long way to winning over communities, many of whom are enthusiastic supporters of the salmon companies because they seem to be the only ones putting in the infrastructure.On Rum, for instance, Mowi paid for the installation of a pontoon for visiting yachties with an honesty box at the end. The money collected was then given to the school, to fund trips off the island for the pupils.:Transforming derelict sites \"can promote growth and well-being\"On all the islands where they farm, salmon companies regularly use their boats to help out, bringing building materials from the mainland and even acting as an ambulance service, taking islanders to the mainland for medical help.Scotlandrsquos salmon companies are prepared to step in and provide housing and broadband and other services to remote communities ndash they have certainly shown that.There is obviously a frustration within salmon companies that this responsibility is landing on their shoulders, but there is also a feeling that this is part of the contract they have with local communities, helping out wherever they can.Hamish Macdonell is the director of strategic engagement at Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10292374.jpg?type=article-full","title":"olaf-falafels-joke-top-fringe-funnies","story":"In the past, it has been won by japes about hedgehogs, wry observations on picking a password and one-liners about hoovers.And now Swedish comedian Olaf Falafelrsquos zinger about vegetable-related Tourettersquos, ldquoI keep randomly shouting out Broccoli and Caullower - I think I might have Florets, deemed the funniest joke at the Fringe.:Lonely Planet top  -Edinburgh Fringe is UKs star attractionEach year TV station Dave sends out its experts in search of the festivals best line, before subjecting their picks to a public vote.The Edinburgh Festival is one of the biggest cultural events in the worldOlaf Falafels line received backing from  per cent who deemed it the top tickler after it was nominated from his show Itrsquos One Giant Leek For Mankind.With the goal of finding the wittiest one-liners, an expert  of ten judges was recruited comprising the UKrsquos leading comedy critics.After touring and scouring hundreds of venues and shows at the renowned Edinburgh Festival Fringe Festival, the  submitted their favourite six jokes, listed without naming the comics behind each one, to a vote of , Brits.:Helen Bauer wants to make a scene with first Fringe performance#Winner Olaf Falafel is a surrealist comedian and illustrator.

If you see a hedgehog lay still in the open, or with flies round it orit’s struggling to walk properly, it is in urgent need of rescue.”If you find a hedgehog in need of help the society suggest you use gardening gloves or an old towel to collect the animal, placing it inside a high sided cardboard or plastic box with the towel or an old t-shirt in the bottom for it to hide under. Take the box indoors away from flies.If the hedgehog isn’t bleeding, offering a warm wrapped hot water bottle is good first aid, but do make sure there is room for it to get offit gets too warm and ensure the bottle is not allowed to go cold.Offer some meaty cat or dog food and water but don’t force feed it.Once you’ve done that, call a local hedgehog rescue centreyou know of one, or BHPS on    for further advice and local contacts.If it’s a baby, Fay says you should check for siblings.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances that led up to the incident\"  Appeal for information following suspicious fire in Peterhead viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"“Hoglets don’t usually come in ones,” she said. “If a hoglet it is trouble, its brothers and sisters may well need help too, so do look around vicinity for others.” She added: “Acting quickly could literally mean the dference between le and death.

Now we want to reach out to the public and local organisations theand breadth of Scotland to get their feedback.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to consider the new strategy and to join the conversation. “The consultation is available online but we will also be going out to communities across rural, island and urban locations in the next  weeks where it would be great to hear as many views as possible.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Colin points out a wall during the Bennachie dig.\"  Open day for people to see dig at Bennachie viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"The strategy aims to protect our climate as well as meeting the needs of its people and businesses.It’s a fine balancing act but the government believes the strategy will tackle climate change, help the economy prosper and improve our health and well-being. There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions by phoning  ,# said those involved.A spokesperson for the project went on to say: “A huge thanks to all the landowners who have helped us by agreeing the essential land access we need to get started.

They will be checked regularly by the project staff.The Orkney Native Wildle Project is a partnership between Orkney Islands Council, Scottish Natural Heritageand RSPB Scotland. Following three years of development generous support for the project has been provided by, the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Le, providing a combined grant of £. million for the duration of the five-year project.Stoats are native to the UK Mainland but not to Orkney, where they were first recorded in . Since then the population has increased rapidly and is now fully established and widely-distributed throughout Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.

And you know what  She is absolutely right.What we need more than anything , as Boris lets us teeter on a no-deal clf edge, is someone who will put the country first. We need consensus.We need politicians to sit around the table and start talking common sense. The clock is ticking, and we need to make progress fast. The truth is that quite a few of us at Westminster have been trying to do that for the past year.Groups of Liberal Democrat, Labour, Conservative, even SNP MPs have been meeting regularly to work on common ground and an approach which puts the country before inidual party interest.Jeremy Corbyn has not been part of those discussions.: Jo Swinson ‘daft’ to oppose Jeremy Corbyn plan to stop no deal Brexit, says Nicola SturgeonFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereIndeed, for most of the past year I could not have told you where the Labour frontbench stood on Brexit. Were they for it  Against no-deal  Supporting Remain  We all know their policy descriptor has been ‘constructive ambiguity’. I would agree with half of that statement, and it is certainly not the word ‘constructive’.There have, of course, been Labour and former Labour MPs who have been more than happy working to find a common route forward. One of them was Chuka Umunna. And former Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston was another who was prepared to search for that consensus.Signicantly, both of them now sit as Liberal Democrats. They will be joined on the yellow benches after recess by Parliament’s newest MP, Jane Dodds.She was the Lib Dem victor in the recent Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, when Remain parties worked together to put the country’s interest before that of our inidual parties. Which brings me back to exactly what the country is crying out for: consensus.This past week Jo Swinson argued that what we need now is a vote of no-confidence to replace this Boris-led administration with a government of national unity.In her first major keynote speech since becoming leader, she laid out the case that the Prime Minister’s determination to leave on  October “do or die” is utterly irresponsible.She described a no-deal Brexit as bad for the NHS, bad for the rural economy and bad for our family of nations in the United Kingdom.: Jeremy Corbyn: ‘It’s not up to Jo Swinson to decide next PM’And she said that to be certain of preventing that no-deal outcome we need a successful vote of no confidence in Johnson’s administration.Then, within  days we need to install a temporary cross-party government with an alternative Prime Minister who has the confidence of the House and will stop a no-deal Brexit.We are facing a national emergency and we need an emergency government to resolve it. What she didn’t say, and what caused an immediate angry reaction from the left, is that Jeremy Corbyn should be that alternative Prime Minister.The reason for that is simple: he does not have the numbers. He is unable to command the support of enough MPs across the House to make that happen.Of course, Nicola Sturgeon has said that her MPs would support Jeremy Corbyn – just a week after his sidekick John McDonnell made it clear that a future Labour government would be happy to see another independence referendum in Scotland.But where there is reticence to back a party leader who has found it dficult to command the support of many of his own MPs throughout this parliament.It would need Conservative MPs to back a man they have already failed to find a compromise with on Brexit. Would they not all be more likely to back someone seen to be above party politics Which brings me back to Ken Clarke and Harriet Harman.Surely either of them, or perhaps another political grandee, has the reputation and respect to galvanise Tory rebels, Labour Remainers, Liberal Democrats, SNP, Plaid Cymru, Caroline Lucas and the independents.It does have to be all of them, because that is the only way that it can succeed. AndMr Corbyn genuinely wants that to happen surely even, he can see that he should agree to someone  leading it.This should not be about personalities, or inidual parties, but about finding a way that actually works. Don’t get me wrong. If Mr Corbyn can somehow overcome the past two years and suddenly command cross-party support in the House and successfully steer us away from the clf-edge, I would be happy.But so far, I see no prospect of that, and we do not have time to wait and seehe can. The clock is ticking, and we are getting ever closer to that clf-edge.We need that vote of no confidence, we need that unity government and we need to take this back to the people to be sure of what they really want.Most of all we need to avoid the no-deal that would be so disastrous for all of us. In pursuing that solution Jo Swinson and the Liberal Democrats have only one red line. It has to be a proposal that can work.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch a modern highland clearance is being hidden behind a population boom in inverness","story":"The Highlands population boom is happening in its cities and towns, masking on-going problems, writes Lesley Riddoch. There’s plenty of good news for the Highlands and Islands.Visitor numbers are up. Orkney leads the sht to electric cars and renewable energy. And now, Spain Greece and Croatia are so impressed with Highland and Islands Enterprisethey plan to set up similar growth-creating quangos of their own.Why  Because the Highlands has reversed centuries of population decline to regain its ’s total of , folk - and these southern EU member states believe HIE and its predecessor the Highlands and Islands Development Board are largely responsible.Now it would be churlish not to express delight that the “basket-case” Highlands have proved doubters wrong. HIE and more particularly the HIDB have indeed pump-primed much of that economic development and the University of the Highlands and Islands, with its digital learning and dispersed campuses, has been another positive development.But it would be mistaken to presume the job-creating quangos have single-handedly produced a miraculous pan-Highland population increase - as I think they would be first to admit. It would be wrong to presume population growth is happening beyond Highland towns and cities like Inverness, Aviemore, Nairn, Dingwall, Fort William, Oban, Kirkwall, Lerwick and Portreewrong to presume that the region’s age profile is irrelevant and absolutely wrong to think the  population total is as good as the Highlands and Islands can get.While the population of Highland towns is growing, more remote areas are facing a modern clearance thanks to long-term leases for locals being replaced with short-term lets for tourists unaffordable land and empty glens caused by Scotland’s archaic land ownership patterns the loss of East-European seasonal labour endangering seasonal businesses worry over the impending impact of Brexit-related tarfs on fisheries and agricultural produce and cuts in services like public transport, elderly care and childcare - until recently there was just one nursery in the whole of Sutherland. It would be troublingthe decision to use HIE as a role model by Mediterranean states, gave the impression that all’s well in Highlandand prompted Scots to question the need for urgent action to stop another generation of young Highland Scots giving up and moving out. Yesterday, a Sunday newspaper spent five pages questioning the success of community landownership in Scotland on the basis of one problematic forestry scheme on Bute. Is this really the Highlands’ biggest issue  What’s needed is a wider perspective. Firstly, urban growth can easily conceal the hard fact that half an hour down the road, “remote” Highland and Island communities are really struggling.Last year a report by the James Hutton Institute predicted the working age population in Scotland’s rural areas will plummet by a third by , pushing communities in remote corners of the Highlands and Islands into a “spiral of decline.” It found “sparsely populated areas” - defined as those more than half an hour away from a town of , folk - account for almost half of Scotland’s land mass, but just . per cent of Scotland’s population. These places are projected to lose more than a quarter of their population in the next  years, with Western Isles, Argyll and the Southern Uplands among the worst affected. Yet the picture is so dferent in the Highland capital. In , the population of Inverness was ,. In  it was almost ,, with a quarter of the Highland population living in or around it. So, let’s call a spade a spade. The Inverness Black Isle Nairn corridor is doing well - picking up southerners looking for the best quality of le in the UK and young Highlanders pushed out of more remote glens - not because land there is irredeemably infertile and fit only for use as a grouse moor, rich man’s playground or re-wilding but because centuries of paternalistic ownership mean there’s no available, affordable land, therefore no affordable housing and therefore no feasible way for younger folk to take advantage of the jobs and business opportunities that absolutely do exist. Planning presumptions all too often mirror that man-made, unnatural emptiness. So, let’s think again about the levels of population we should expect in the Highlands and Islands and reconsider the date chosen to illustrate the scale of the present population surge.The s saw the Highlands on its collective knees after seventy years of clearance and widespread starvation as a result of the potato famine. Is this a suitable benchmark for the carrying capacity of the scenic, energy-rich, culturally-vibrant region today We should be comparing and contrasting the Highlands and Islands not with the region’s own broken past but with the thriving present of its neighbours - like Tromso, the capital of Arctic Norway. Situated on an island amidst barren fjords, it lies more than a thousand miles north of Inverness. Yet the population of this truly remote city matches the Highland capital with , folk. Arctic Bodø has . residents, Alta , and sub-Arctic Trondheim a whopping , residents.The relatively high population base of remote Northern Norway has been achieved not by the actions of specic quangos, but by the fact Norway escaped feudalism, therefore has the largest and most erse number of inidual landowners in Europe and land prices that are a fraction of those demanded for the tiny parcels available in Highland Scotland. Folk in Northern Norway were also aided by the abolition of nobility in , the nationalisation of rivers for hydro power straight after independence and a long tradition of ultra-local democratic control which prompted investment in light industry.Let’s be clear. Scotland’s community buyouts have boosted highland and island populations and provided jobs with secure, affordable and properly insulated homes in remote areas where private owners miserably failed. The problem is that rural Scotland cannot be fixed, acre by acre, or buyout by buyout. Community control delivers speedy relief for the communities able to jump hurdles and take over control, but places a strain on volunteers and leaves Scotland’s highly dysal systems of land ownership and distant democratic control unchanged and intact. So, let’s imagine what the Highlands might look likeHolyrood and Westminster politicians were as bold as community activists, delivering the modern equivalent of the Crofting Acts, or the high rates of taxation that prompted one-fth of Scottish land to be sold in the s or Tom Johnston’s hydro-electric revolution in the s.The Highlands urgently needs release from outdated feudal structures to grow sustainably. Governments not quangos can deliver.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"the scotsman says any future independence referendum must pose the right question","story":"Doubtless, it is a development that will frustrate supporters of independence but we believe the Electoral Commission is correct to intervene in discussions over the staging of a second referendum on Scotland#s place in the UK.The elections watchdog’s insistence it must be allowed to assess the question that would be asked may prevent First Minister Nicola Sturgeon from staging the quick-fire referendum she desires but recent experience tells us a careful approach to such votes is essential.The commission – which has also proposed a y timeframe for the staging of any second referendum – has called for a series of changes to Scottish Government legislation, paving the way for Indyref. Perhaps the most problematic issue is the proposed wording of any referendum question. The Scottish Government has proposed the commission should not, where it has previously been involved in assessing the question asked of voters, have any further input. This would mean the First Minister could simply ask the same question – should Scotland be an independent country  – as in . However, the commission ruled out a Yes No question in ’s EU referendum, insisting a question to which the answer was either Leave or Remain was more balanced.The Scotsman will take no position during a future independence referendum campaign but it is our view that such a vote must be scrupulously fair, with the wording of the question giving no advantage to either side. We are also in favour of the commission’s proposal for greater controls over campaign spending and tougher powers to deal with any breaches of financial limits. It is clear that regulation of spending during the EU referendum was not as strict as it should have been and damaging ‘grey areas’ were allowed to develop.Nicola Sturgeon and her supporters hunger for a referendum in the next year. The chances of this happening were always going to be slender. The Conservative Government has, after all, repeatedly made clear its opposition to a second vote on independence.The First Minister may see the opportunity to make political capital from this latest apparent road block but we hope she, and all political leaders, will engage with the Electoral Commission to ensure that – should it take place – the next referendum on Scottish independence is scrupulously fair.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"mice droppings and mould found at michelin starred the kitchin in edinburgh","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...According to the Scottish Mail on Sunday, The Kitchin, which opened in Edinburgh in , was also criticised for having too few sinks.The newspaper said a council report on hygiene warns the famous chef to clean up his restaurants act.The restaurant, where tasting menus charge up to £ a head, was awarded a Michelin star in , and has held onto it ever since.City of Edinburgh Council inspectors reportedly visited the restaurant in June. - Football riot kills three and injures , including former Celtic playerThe documents, which the paper obtained under Freedom of Information laws, show the chef was informed that follow-up checks would take place.The letter reads: \"An inspection of the above premises was carried out on June  , when the following contraventions were noted.

It is customary, indeed a pre-requisite, that before great battles commence there is no limit to intentionally circulating misinformation of what one force or another intends to do.Deception can take the shape of an error not meant to break the surface. One such was Operation Mincemeat, where before the invasion of Sicily both Churchill and Eisenhower approved the use of a dead London tramp’s body to play the role of a Royal Marine carrying sensitive documents that were of course . Washed up on the Spanish shore the secrets carried by “The Man who never was” had the effect of directing Axis troop deployments to Greece and Sardinia but crucially not Sicily. That Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond but back then working for naval military intelligence, had a hand in the ruse has since given the escapade its own notoriety.Alternatively intentionally revealing plans that apparently cannot be hidden but are in reality feints on a grand scale to throw opponents off might be deployed. One such example was Operation Fortitude’s phantom armiesdesigned to convince Nazi Germany’s High Command that the Normandy landings were themselves only a ersionary tactic. These deceptions are not just deployed during war but happen regularly in commerce, such as announcing the end of a particular brand or recipe for a brand so that the kickback from distressed loyal customers creates a higher media profile that raises sales. The proposed changes are then withdrawn in response to “customer demand” and all is well with the world.• : Corbyn can’t be national unity PM, he can barely keep Labour together – Christine JardineThroughout le we are met with deceptions that are meant to distract us from a larger event or simply manage our expectations. It is the stuff of pulp fiction in romance, crime thrillers and political tussles. That it should happen now during the preparations of the UK’s expected exit from the European Union should be a surprise to no one – but many shall be fooled.Will there be some disruption brought about by the changes known and unknown  Of course, just as there was when decimalisation changed the way we counted our money and weighed our goods – or when we entered the European Economic Community. There were some who sought to exploit each change for their own benefit by raising prices under the guise of greater costs or changes in supply. So we can expect some disruption and we can expect some among us to seek to take advantage from it, be it commercial or political – but their motives in most cases will be blindingly obvious.So this past week we have had much manufactured fog descend upon us to confuse us and deceive us as Brexit approaches. Some authors of this  fog wish to create fake news to scare a nervous public into the remainer camp. Some, such as the incredulous worst case scenario “Yellowhammer” report that appeared in the Sunday papers has all the look of an attempt to manage expectations by exaggerating what impact “No Deal” will have. There is no need for a hard border between Ireland and the UK. Thanks to the use of existing customs practice we will have no need of it, the Irish have said they will not erect one – so it will be for the EU to impose one. Let us see who’s been lying to the public, fomenting ision and heightening tension. As I have said in this column before, Keep Calm and Carry On, Brexit is coming deal or no deal.• : Brexit: Boris Johnson to tell Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron that there must be a new dealAs examples of the fog of war go, any talk of a government of “national unity” is a real pea-souper. How could it be unying  It would seek to stop the Prime Minister respecting the outcomeof the greatest democratic event in our history. It would mean a cabinet composed entirely of remain-supporting MPs, for how could any leave support in all conscience be part of it  It would mean government by parliament rather than an executive scrutinised and held to account by parliament – so who would scrutinise and hold parliament to account The majority of the British people would have their wish torpedoed by politicians, the vast majority of whom were elected promising to honour the referendum and deliver Brexit. There would be no national unity, there would be greater ision than we even know today with democracy tossed on a bonfire of broken promises and political self-interest. Any election that followed would no longer be about parties or even policies but about the new ide of the people versus parliament. A government of National Unity is so oxymoronic as to be decidedly and repulsively Orwellian.Jeremy Corbyn tried to take advantage of this political disarray in Westminster by offering himself up as the potential caretaker prime minister but so transparent was this tactic that it dissolved on launch. Maybe one day it will be made into a film entitled “The prime minister who never was”. The illiberal undemocratic leader Jo Swinson offered up Labour’s Harriet Harman and Conservative Ken Clarke as alternatives – and they obliged by preening themselves before the media­ – but they too are being met with derision. Clarke might at least attract some of the necessary Conservative support – but really  His role as former Deputy-Chairman of British American Tobacco led George Monbiot to argue he was unfit for office  The Chancellor who wanted to increase VAT on fuel, but when defeated raised the tax on whisky – and the health minister with a record of abusing workers rights second to none. Would Labour and nationalist MPs swallow that Clarke’s proposed anointment did cause me to wonder , having backed anyone but Boris for the premiership, Ruth Davidson would give her full backing to Clarke rather than face “No Deal”  Is she with Boris – or cuddling up to Ken Most bizarrely the Green MP Caroline Lucas, following a spasm of misandry, suggested only an all women Cabinet could prevent Brexit.All of this assumes a no-confidence motion in the new prime minister winning the day – which is by no means certain.There shall be much more of this fog to come before it clears and we can see what was truth and what was fake.

The Electoral Commission has also set out a year-long timeframe for holding a second vote on leaving the UK that appears to make the First Minister’s hopes to stage a poll late next year increasingly forlorn.The Scottish Government has published legislation at Holyrood to pave the way for a second referendum but the commission calls for a series of changes to be made in key areas, including the proposed question, in a submission to Holyrood’s constitution committee.The watchdog warns: “The Electoral Commission must be required to assess any referendum question proposed in legislation, and set the commission’s views before the Scottish Parliament, regardless of whether the commission has previously published views on the question proposed.”What question will be put to voters has been contentious since the ReferendumsBill was published in May. The bill said that,the proposed question had already been assessed by the commission, it should not have to be assessed again. This would exclude the commission’s involvement in the same question as  – “Should Scotland be an Independent Country ”The commission has since ruled out a Yes No question in the Brexit referendum, instead recommending a Remain Leave question. This was found to be more balanced after fresh evidence was taken.A change from Yes No to a Leave Remain question could damage the pro-independence movement, with the Yes campaign widely seen as having been successful in conveying a positive message in .In its submission to MSPs, the commission says: “At any referendum it is essential that voters can easily understand and answer the question and any statement which precedes it on the ballot paper.“The intelligibility of the referendum question is fundamental to voters’ ease of understanding and participation in the referendum and underpins the legitimacy of the outcome.”Although not obliged to accept the recommendations of the commission, it would be politically dficult for the SNP to forge ahead with plans for a second referendum without the endorsement of the independent elections watchdog. The Scottish Government would also need authorisation from Westminster through a Section  order to stage a second referendum. It may be that a future UK government inclined to grant a Section  order would withhold it until the Electoral Commission’s views are respected.Ms Sturgeon’s hopes of staging the referendum late next year were undermined by a timeframe of at least nine months set out by the commission. This would include a -week period for the watchdogto assess the question and provide a view on it before legislation or regulations are passed. The legislation should also be passed six months before the final ten-week referendum period, when rules around campaigning and spending apply. It suggests time is running out on Ms Sturgeon’s preferred timeframe of late next year for a second referendum, with the legislation itself yet to be formally passed at Holyrood.There are also concerns over the risk of foreign companies using UK subsidiaries to fund referendum campaigns in Scotland with money that comes from outside the UK.The commission wants better information about campaign spending recorded by participants, and powers to impose fines of £, instead of the £, proposed in the bill.A Scottish Government spokesperson said the legislation makes “specic provision” for the involvement of the commission to consider the proposed referendum question. The concern centres on “repeat testing” of questions that have already been found to be intelligible. He added: “It will be for Parliament as a whole to decide and vote on these matters – both the proposals in the bill and in any regulations made under it – and we will of course listen to all views put forward.“ The  referendum question was proposed by the Electoral Commission and provides clear precedent for a simple, straightforward and understandable question.”Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said the Scottish Government must respect the views of the elections watchdog.She said: “If MSPs press ahead with the bill, it is vital that this important recommendation from the Electoral Commission is actioned.”“Should we ever be in the situation where Scotland’s place in the UK is subject to another referendum, to ensure that it is carried out fairly and the result is respected by all, the wording of the question must be looked at again by the Electoral Commission in all circumstances, includingthe question proposed is the same as in .”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

David Mitchell and his we both died in Drumore, David on November ,  and Jean in .Drumore Township is on the southern border of both Lancaster County and the state of Pennsylvania. The area was disputed between the states of Maryland and Pennsylvania and it is believed that the Pennsylvania authorities directed Scots-Irish settlers into that area as they felt they would robustly defend the border with Maryland.The vast majority of the original settlers’ names are local to County Down including Reed, Simpson, McIntyre, Smith, Crawford, Porter, Fleck, Boyd, Knox, Alexander, White, McGlaughlan, Saunders, Liggit, McElroy, Clark, Richey, Long, King, Scott, Martin, Robinson, McClellan, Penney, Neel, McDowell, Bradley, Caldwell, McNiel, Moore, McCullough, Mitchell, Steel, Thom, Maxwell, Irwin, Neal, Morrison, Brown, Graham, Huey, Buchanon, McKleheny, Rowland, Hughes, Nelson and Barkley.Some of the original farm names are Dungannon, Downpatrick, Lurgan, Lisburn, King’s Choice and Drumore.The original settlers on the farm named Drumore were Samuel Morrison followed by James and Hugh Martin.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me. I am aware of bottles from Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge but am yet to locate these. In particular, the Crystal Mineral Water company in Banbridge produced some fantastic stoneware bottles and it would be the pinnacle of my collection to add one of these.” The bottle from the Crystal Mineral Company in Banbridge that Neil would love to add to his collectionExplaining the history of stoneware bottles, he said: “They were produced during the Victorian era, late s, early s, and were all hand made. No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there. I have a fantastic photo of my grandmother working in the mill taken during the Coronation in . I am seeking anything relating to the mill and its history such as receipts, packaging or advertising or even furniture.”Neil commented: “I am part of a local history group, who meet regularly to discuss past events and places and we regularly showcase items so that they can be shared by all.“I would really love to put on an exhibition in Banbridge and that’s probably where this is going.”Open Day raises over £, Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Sadly Neil’s we Kate doesn’t share his enthusiasm for artefacts from the past: “She thinks it’s a load of junk, she’s a minimalist.”If you can help Neil add to his collection email him at neilreid@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed the 20 ni sights on lonely planet s ultimate uk travel guide","story":"The Giant#s Causeway has been ranked as the UK#s third best tourist destination by respected travel guide Lonely Planet, finishing ahead of attractions such as Hadrian#s Wall and London#s Tate Modern art gallery.For the first time Lonely Planet has picked its  most unmissable experiences and hidden gems across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands to form its ultimate UK travel hitlist.Titanic Belfast was also ranked in the top  UK destinations by Lonely PlanetIn total,  sights and experiences in Northern Ireland feature in the list which was unveiled today, including the Crown Liquor Saloon in Belfast, Rathlin Island and Londonderry’s walls.Out of the score of attractions only one is in Co Armagh , while none of the sights in Co Tyrone feature in the Lonely Planet must see list.Welcoming the news, Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “The inclusion of  Northern Ireland experiences and attractions – including the Giant’s Causeway at number three – in Lonely Planet’s ‘Ultimate UK Travelist’ is good news and will surely help to inspire GB travellers to put Northern Ireland on their holiday wish-list. “It is another well-deserved accolade for all of these attractions, which provides Tourism Ireland with a great hook to continue to promote Northern Ireland as a ‘must visit’ destination.”Lonely Planet’s VP of Experience, Tom Hall, said: “Lonely Planet’s Ultimate United Kingdom Travelist brings together the UK’s most compelling sights and experiences, ranging from world-class museums and giant cathedrals to rollicking festivals, inky lochs and tiny pubs. “We’re thrilled to name the Giant’s Causeway one of the UK’s very best sights - alongside many other wonderful experiences in Northern Ireland including spotting puffins and seals on Rathlin Island and riding a boat through Co Fermanagh’s Marble Arch Caves.”Giant’s Causeway is described by Lonely Planet as “timeless” and “unrepeatable” and is beaten only by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and London’s British Museum.The Ultimate UK Travelist is available at a cost of £..

mcauleys mum speaks on his","story":"THE mother of -year-old Gerald McAuley who was shot dead by a loyalist gunman in August  says she has never felt any hatred towards the man who took her son’s le. While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

Fans will be treated to singles Feel the Raindrops, Your Greatest Shade of Blue and s classic Broken Land – the ‘most played song on Radio ’ during that particular year. With just over two weeks to go until they tak the stage, songwriter Pat Gribben told the Andersonstown News that he along with the rest of the band are “looking forward” to the August  gig. “Of course it’s always nice to be asked,” said Pat, “I’m looking forward to catching up with Brian Kennedy. I played guitar with Brian and haven’t seen him since his illness and now that he is cancer free, it will be good to see him.”On composing one of the most iconic songs of the s, Broken Land, Pat explained how he had been “messing about” on producer Garry Bell’s keyboards. “I got my daughter to school that Monday morning and the main part of the song was done that day,” he said.Still heavily rotated on airwaves  plus years later, Pat said there are lots of songs written that could appear on a new Adventures album. “I think we are playing better now than back in the day, I don’t know why, maybe we are all more experienced. I’d like to put a new album out and give the people that come to see, that are coming to see us, that new work, new material to sing along to.”Pat spoke of how the band are already looking to  with a series of gigs already lined up. “I have a lot of material and it’s a matter of putting it all down and getting it out there.

From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level.

has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit general election once-in-a-generation chance for changeJohnson under pressure to recall Parliament following no-deal Brexit warningsSome .% of respondents said they would vote in favour of \"a border in the Irish Sea\" and would rather Northern Ireland remained more closely aligned with the EU than Great Britain.Some .% said they would reject the compromise, while .% said they did not know.Within the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them would not support Northern Ireland being separated from the UK.\"As the UK hurtles towards its exit from the European Union, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said will go ahead with or without a deal on October , experts have warned that at least , jobs could be at risk in Northern Irelandan agreement is not reached.Sir Jeffrey said the survey has no bearing on his partys position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":null,"title":"backlash as linfield consider ditching no sunday games rule","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

But Linfield chiefs feel that -they reach the group stages of the Europa League - their team will need an extra day to recover from their Thursday night fixture before playing again.Hence the proposal to move Saturday games to Sundays, despite the long-standing Never On A Sunday rule in its constitution.Mr McGivern said: \"To reach the group stages would be huge for the club and many things need to be taken into consideration.\"We will have extra games - and that will have an impact in terms of scheduling our league matches.\"We cant play home games at Windsor Park on a Sunday because of a club rule. \"Will we have to change that  Probably, but our members will decide that.\"Linfield can play away on a Sunday but there must be a rule change for a home fixture.\"We will be a few games behind other sides and thats the price for being successful in Europe.\"The whole image of the club will be lted and theres obvious financial benefits.\"However, possible change to the clubs constitution has been criticised by North Antrim MLA Mr Allister. \"I think it will be a retrograde step,\" Mr Allister said.\"Theyve had that rule for a very long time. \"To use the exigency of this present situation as an excuse for changing it permanently I think would be inappropriate - and out of keeping with the culture and tradition of Irish League football.\"The ban on Sunday football matches was lted by the Irish Football Association only in , despite protests from the DUP and evangelical campaigners, including the Free Presbyterian Church.The first match held on a Sunday since the ban was lted was an Irish Premiership match between Glentoran and Bangor at The Oval in Belfast.See back page for full story"},{"url":null,"title":"bombay streets burning by loyalists 50 years ago remembered in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In recent times, many of our young and our most highly educated citizens have emigratedCharlie FlanaganDe facto partners of Irish citizens will be allowed to apply for permission to reside in the country before they travel to Ireland.“Pre-clearance will provide greater certainty for people considering or planning on moving back home to Ireland with their non-EEA de facto partner,” Mr Flanagan said.He said he wants to ensure there is a “clear and simple” path for those who want toto Ireland.“I hope this will encourage more people to come home. In recent times, many of our young and our most highly educated citizens have emigrated,” he said.“They may have wanted to further their careers, make more money, or simply to experience the wider world. While away, some have met le partners and perhaps even started their own families. “We want to show these people that Ireland is ready to welcome them home and that we will provide a clear immigration and labour market pathway for their de facto partners.”The change means the immigration situation of de facto partners will be more akin to non-EEA spouses and civil partners of Irish citizens.Under the previous system, the application process for de facto partners could only begin after their arrival in the state and may have taken up to a year to complete.Now, once pre-clearance has been granted, applicants can arrive and register with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Serviceimmediately, and will have access to the labour market straight away.The new process addresses one of the key recommendations of the Indecon Report, Addressing Challenges faced by ing Irish emigrants, and is part of an ongoing INIS customer service improvement plan.Full details and further information on the revised arrangements, including the criteria for obtaining pre-clearance, are set out on the INIS website www.inis.gov.ie"},{"url":null,"title":"boy 12 critical after electric shock on","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After he trained as an architect and engineer, he was apprenticed to the Derry building firm of George and Robert A. Ferguson. He later set up his own practice in the city and at a young age was responsible for large projects in Omagh, Coleraine and other towns.Amongst the projects he oversaw in his native city were the Corporation waterworks at Creggan and was he was also associated to the layout of Foyle College grounds for building purposes. But amongst Barkers main projects was designing a shirt factory for David Hogg and Charles Mitchell at Sackville Street in Derry. He had also been heavily involved in the project to build the new Presbyterian |Church at Burt, Co Donegal in the mid-s.Constructed in , Hogg  Mitchell’s shirt factory almost immediately won a highly lucrative contract when it became the supplier of shirts for the British Army during the Boer War . The company founded the ‘Old England’ line of shirts which later became the globally known ‘Peter England’ brand. It continued to manufacture shirts in Derry until the s and the façade of Barker’s building still exists today as the building was converted into an apartment block in .Tragedy struck William Barker when in late  he fell off a horse and never recovered consciousness before his death at the young age of  on May , .He left a widow, Maryand three children-Mary Violet Barker, Thomas McCurdy Baker and William Alexander his namesake at his home at Orchard Street in the centre of the city.While William Snr undoubtedly left his professional mark even at such a young age on his native city, it was his son Thomas who lived a truly fascinating le having borne bearing personal witness and suffered as a result of one of the most decisively brutal acts of the Second World War.Thomas McCurdy Barker was born in , was a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. He was the first full-time secretary of the Irish Christian Movement, the convenor and organiser of the  conference ‘Ireland’s Hope’, the proceedings of which he edited, and from the s a missionary and professor of New Testament Greek at Mukden in the Chinese province of Manchuria.The Second Sino-Japanese War was fought between the Republic of China and The Empire of Japan between July  and September . China fought Japan with the aid of the Soviet Union and the USA, but after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in  the conflict became immersed in WWII and a result became the largest conflict in Asia during the twentieth century.The war between China and Japan was the result of a decades long Japanese imperialist policy to expand its influence both politically and militarily in order to secure access to raw materials, food and labour.Internecine warfare in China also provided strong opportunities for Japan who viewed Manchuria as almost limitless supply of raw materials, a market fot its manufactured goods and a protective buffer against the Soviet Union in Siberia.Japan invaded Manchuria in September  after what bacame known as the Mukden Incident. It was an event staged by Japanese military personnel as a pretext for a full invasion.On September , Lieutenant Suemori Kawamoto detonated a small quantity of dynamite close to a rail line owned by Japans South Manchuria Railyway near Mukden. The explosion was so weak that it failed to destroy the track, but it was enough to allow the Imperial Japanese Army to accuse Chinese dissident with causing it and as a result they invaded and occupied Manchuria, establishing a puppet state called Manchukuo after five months of incessant fighting. The Japanese even installed Chinas last Emperor, Puyi as the ruler to try and lend legitimacy to thwe situation.The invasion of the whole of China came six years later in July  when Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo Bridge-an access route to Bejing. As the conflict became merged into WWII, the Japanese began imprisoning people in concentration camps and amongst these was Rev Thomas McCurdy Barker who was incarcerated for the duration of the war at Nagasaki.On the day of the U.S nuclear strike on August ,  the population of Nagasaki was estimated to be ,. There were , Japanese residents, , Korean residents, , conscripted Korean workers, , Japanese soldiers,  conscripted Chinese workers and  Allied POWs.A Boeing B- Superfortress plane called Bockscar, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, took off just before dawn carrying a plutonium bomb code named Fat Man.The initial target was the city of Kokura, but it was obscured by cloud and smoke, so the Americans turned their attention to their secondary target-Nagasaki. But, it too was covered by cloud. Running short of fuel, the plane encircled the city several times and it was decided to use radar to drop the device. But, at the last moment the cloud cleared and the bomb was dropped on the citys Urakami Valley-midway between the Mitshubishi Steel and Arms plant in the south and the Mitsubhisi-Urakami Ordnace works in the north.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe plane had arrived over Nagasaki at .am and just under a minute after it was released it exploded at .am at an altitude of approximately , ft.

Amongst the casualties were , of the , employees of of the Mitsubhisi arms plant and , more factory workers at ious other sites. These included , Koreans and  Japanese soldiers.Industrial damage at Nagasaki was high and left between -% of industrial production destroyed. The attack came three days after the first nuclear bomb had been dropped on Hiroshoma, but the Nagasaki device was more powerful than the first bomb but because the city was surrounded by hilly terrain there was less damage.In , another Irish prisoner who also witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki. This was Dr Aidan MacCarthy, a medic in the RAF from County Cork who wrote: “Then there followed a blue flash, accompanied by a very bright magnesium-type flare which blinded them. Then came a frighteningly loud by rather flat explosion which was followed by a blast of hot air.“Some of this could be felt even by us as it came through the shelter openings, which were very rarely closed owing to poor ventilation.“We all genuinely thought, for some time, that this was the end of the world.”Amongst his fellow prisoners was a community of Catholic nuns to whom in the absence of a priest Rev McCurdy ministered to every day-an act which was later recognised when he received thanks from Pope Pius XII when he learned of the Derry mans actions after the war.Also there was Ann Barker, the Rev Thomas second we, who as a medical doctor also practised her profession during her imprisonment at Nagasaki. Her expertise is credited with helping her husband continue to live a rich le in his later retirement despite the effects that the bomb had on his physique.Lilian McCombe was a school teacher at the Presbyterian station at Mukden where she had lived and worked since .In  she wrote: “That chapter of my le closed with the attack by Japan on Pearl Harbour on December , . From that date, I with some  other colleagues were under Japanese jurisdiction. The greater part of the intervening years were spent in internment camps in the cities of Kobe and Nagasaki.“After a non-stop voyage of around three weeks via the Pacic Ocean, I was welcomed in the USA by my brother James, staying several days with the family there. The old Queen Elizabeth, then a troop ship brought me to Southampton, next day to be greeted by my family and later, by a host of friends!“Following a period of ing health, I was eventually led back into teaching until retirement age was reached.”The horrendous experience of imprisonment and a nuclear attack however did not appear to dissuade Rev Barker from giving up on his mission or other duties in Manchuria.

He brushed aside two weak challenges in the YC box before firing past Carberry.Within less than a minute it was -.A superb run and cross from Rice was laid off by Neale to the onrushing Thomas Healy and he steered the ball into the corner of Walshrsquos net for his first goal for Killyleagh.Killyleagh were struggling to deal with Olympicrsquos pace in attack, with Molloy in particular causing problems and it took a fine save from Carberry in the th minute to keep out the wingerrsquos curling shot.From the resultant corner Olympicrsquos two big central defenders combined, with Paul Dickson outjumping Macaulay Foster to head back for Jason Noade to head in and make it -.The second half was only four minutes old when Olympic had strong penalty appeals waved away by the referee when McClean went down in the box under a challenge from McConnell.Two goals inside two minutes shortly after the hour mark seemed to have killed the game.Nathan Jones was having his best ever game at The Showgrounds with Killyleagh struggling to cope with his pace when he switched to the left wing in the second half.When he was left one on one with YC sweeper Niall Walsh in the st minute he put on the after burners and delivered a beauty of a finish past Carberry.Ballynahinchrsquos fourth goal, two minutes later, was stunning. A superb team goal passing across the fullof the pitch, orchestrated by Stephen Noade and involving Jones, ended in a YC defender putting into his own net.Killyleagh, though, refused to throw the towel in and when their stand-out player, Rice, yet again exposed a vulnerability on the flanks, his inch-perfect cross was bravely turned in by Neale in the th minute.This was the spark for Killyleaghrsquos best spell of the game with Rice giving width and McConnell the creator and Jamie Sharvin linking up play.Walsh somehow kept out with his feet Jamie Sharvinrsquos nd minute effort from Healyrsquos pass and then three minutes later he gratefully ped on Jamie Sharvinrsquos close range shot under pressure from another Rice cross.The big crowd was getting value for the entrance fee now and Walsh underlined his Amateur League representative reputation by producing a supering save from Ricersquos cross to cut out the danger in the th minute.Olympic were content to hit on the break by this stage and substitute Aaron McClean went close with a header before the visitors delivered the ultimate sucker punch.A stunning pass from deep allowed Jones to race through and Dalton Tate delivered the finish in the nd minute.But still the game wasnrsquot finished. Rice powered down the line yet again and once more producing a teasing cross which Neale thumped in.It was now -. At the opposite end Shane Murray blasted over the bar when he was played through by Jones and then Killyleagh thought they had pulled it back to - to set up a grandstand finish when Nealersquos shot was spilled and Dylan Kelly rled home, but the referee ruled he had been in an offside position when the initial shot was delivered.No one was leaving early and at this rate, there will be plenty looking to book their place for thematch later in the season.By then, Olympic will hope they have further underscored that they are the team best equipped this season to challenge Crumlin Starrsquos stranglehold on the premier title..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sharon stars on Angela’s day  ","story":"LADY luck shone down on Angela Kenmore for her Lady Captainrsquos Day at St Patrickrsquos Golf Club on Saturday.A welcome window in the weather meant that the ladies escaped the dayrsquos frequent deluges and almost miraculously went round rain free.Heavy showers early in the morning had put the competition under threat and the afternoon downpours meant that Mrs Kenmorersquos male guests got a soaking.But not aof rain fell on the ladies, who also had the benefit of not having to play out of the water-logged bunkers.Despite the weather prediction, there was a great turnout and a thrilling finish.Sharon Heaney and Anne Teggart finished tied at the top of the leaderboard with  points, but it was Sharon who took the Lady Captainrsquos prize thanks to a better back nine.With Anne having to settle for the runners-up spot, third place went to Patricia McCormick, who came in with  points.The prize for the best gross went to Caitlin Burke who beat Twyla Gibson on the better back nine after they both ed a score of .The front nine prize went to Mary Rice with  points and Orlagh Carson won the back nine prize with  points.Anne Savage won the past lady captainsrsquo prize with  points and Alison Rooney won the committee prize with  points.Nearest the pin prizes were won by Margaret Willis , Caitlin Burke , Jackie Elliottand Patricia McCormick .Gerry Gray won the lady guestsrsquo prize with  points and Brendan Mullen won the male guestsrsquo prize with  points.The Lady Captainrsquos mixed greensomes competition on Thursday was won by vice-captain Robert McCausland and past lady captain Eileen Mullen with  points mdash one point better than runners-up Ryan Teggart and Carmel Hanvey.Nearest the pin prizes were won by Anne Tumeltyand John Passmore ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Taking porridge and exercise are Roddy’s secrets to long life  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new centenarian, Roderick Maguire, says his secret to a long le is his daily bowl of porridge.The former master painter says he still has porridge every morning which he makes for himself at his Thomas Russell Park home.Mr Maguire, better known as Roddy, turned  nearly two weeks ago on August .He received the customary congratulatory card from the Queen as well as a letter from Irish President Michael DHiggins and euro, mdash a special financial bounty known as the Centenarian award.Mr Maguire was treated to a special reception in St Patrickrsquos Church after parish priest Fr John Murray said a special mass for him on his birthday.His family gathered at Quoile Bistro the next night to have a family reunion, which included children and grandchildren who travelled over from Doncaster in England.With his first we Betty, who sadly died many years ago, he had four children mdash Rory, Joan, Anne and Niall.

I would have considered taking that final step which is what happened to hundreds of young Catholic men and women on and after Bloody Sunday. I do not support the IRA, I do not support violence. What I have always tried to do is to get inside the minds of people who choose to adopt that particular path.#Those comments from the journalist Peter Taylor have stirred up something of a hornet’s nest and, not surprisingly, have been greeted with anger by some and a ‘maybe you can understand now why the IRA had to do what it did’ response from others.Responding on the Nolan Show I said it was clear that thousands of people – within both republicanism and loyalism – had been radicalised by general and specic events, particularly in the early-mid s. That is a fact of history, and the link between being radicalised traumatised and joining terror organisations is not confined to Northern Ireland. But what about the % of us who didn’t take that particular path in Northern Ireland including the countless thousands who were injured and traumatised  The people left behind after the attack or explosion  The people who have spent years acting as carers  The people who lost close friends, family friends, school friends, work colleagues  The people who still look at an empty chair and silent bedroom every day  The hundreds of thousands seated around radios and televisions during the darkest days, listening, with growing anger, to awful news  Maybe we need to find a way of getting inside the minds of those who never went to the dark, bloody side of history. Maybe, instead of ‘understanding’ why people joined terrorist groups, we need to focus on the vast majority who chose not to compound faults and add to the bloodshed .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button As it happens, I do understand how and why people got sucked into terrorism. They chose to. It was always their choice. Circumstances may have been awful, but they need to remember that they chose a path which the vast majority of their friends and neighbours chose to reject. They chose to become a terrorist. They chose to be trained in bomb-making, use of weapons, targeting of people and deciding the lives to be ended on a particular day in a particular place. It was their choice to kill, maim and intimidate. Their choice to become judge, jury and executioner. Their choice to replicate and continue the very thing which had fuelled their own radicalisation. I remember sitting in David Ervine’s office in Stormont about a year after he had been elected as an MLA. He had invited me there to meet a couple of people who were ‘trying to use their own experiences to ensure that the next generation never followed their footsteps into loyalist paramilitarism’. He knew that he had gone down the wrong path and I never doubted that his regret was genuine or that he was trying to make amends for decisions he had made as a much younger man. But like many others I have talked to before and since – and not just on the loyalist side, either – he believed that he had no choice at the time. He did, of course, have another choice. Joining a terroristgroup is not something you do lightly or accidentally. But, as I say, I accepted that David’s regret was genuine. I’ve heard many iations of the ‘ I’d known then what I know now’ conversations and I’ve spoken to many, many people who I believe have since done their best to atone for very bad, very stupid choices. What troubles me, though, is that expressions of regret and clear evidence of atonement sit very uncomfortably with what sometimes look like thedaily commemorations to remember the ‘fallen comrades’of an assortment of terrorist groups. Remembering and honouring ‘volunteers’ from the IRA, UDA, UVF et al carries a very clear sense of justying the choice they made. Even Peter Taylor’s comments about probably joining the IRA because of Bloody Sunday will be interpreted by some as a ‘justication’ of and for the IRA.Regular readers will be aware of my view that the past is always in front of us here in Northern Ireland. This week alone has given us three examples: Peter Taylor saying what he might have chosen to do  years ago Martina Anderson’s ‘Tiocfaidh ár lá’ reference to the death of Bobby Sands in  and ious events to mark the beginning of Operation Banner in . We focus on the past because the future seems to be on hold, while the present is the same-old, same-old played out on continuous loop. Meanwhile, the police and intelligence services are concerned about the rise in activity by dissident republicans and the ongoing presence of loyalist paramilitarismin a number of areas. That’s one manestation of an active past. Stormont isn’t ing because a deal seems extraordinarily dficult to pull together . That’s another manestation of an active past. The relationships between North and South and East and West are more fractious than they’ve been since the early s. That’s another manestation of an active past. There’s a real, all-pervading sense of political drt. Another sign of an active past.We talk a lot about the ‘legacy issue’. It will remain no more than an issue until we actually get to grips with the past in both its personal and collective forms. We need to find a way of escaping from it, rather than always embedding ourselves in it. All sides will have to face very uncomfortable truths about their own past, truths they have deliberately hidden. There’s a key lesson from history: failure to deal with the past will, inevitably, damn and probably bloody your future.Aileen Quinton: We still seem not to have an answer from the DUP as to its

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute.

We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster business top  launch ","story":"Posted on Wednesday  August  by Ulster Business Sarah Little, publishing director, INM NI, Mark Thompson, AL Goodbody with John Mulgrew The cream of Northern Ireland’s business community have gathered to mark the official launch of the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies , with AL Goodbody.
