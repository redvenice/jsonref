The girls were so heavy.\u0027Just as they were about to open an emergency fire exit a firefighter screamed at them to stop because that side of the building above was on fire. Ms Mekonnen couldn\u0027t even finish her sentence as she wonders aloud: \u0027If he hadn\u0027t… I can\u0027t believe we are alive.\u0027Ms Mahmud\u0027s husband Mohammed has admitted he often \u0027thinks back\u0027 to that night when it took them all about 15 minutes to get to the bottom floor with his elderly father, telling GetWestLondon: \u0027I thank God we got out early and we made it.\u0027He revealed that his wife\u0027s best friend and his children\u0027s friends passed away, as well as his friend\u0027s mother.He said of his friend: \u0027Me and him, we had both been in the tower since birth.\u0027He told how all their closest friends were there and how he \u0027prays\u0027 that they\u0027re going to be \u0027reunited\u0027 with them one day.             Meghan poses with women at the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in West LondonMs Mahmud wrote of her involvement with the book: \u0027Last summer, we were placed in a hotel and I had no kitchen to cook for my family.\u0027It was very emotional for me to get in the kitchen. The moment I started cooking I was in tears. I didn\u0027t know why though. I was just excited to be back in the kitchen again.\u0027Word started to spread - the mums from my son\u0027s school came along and they told their friends, too.

Pictured:  The couple together on the set of Hooper in 1978              The Oscar-winning actress (pictured on Monday) has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died on September 6 aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoirField has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died earlier this month aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoir. And now that the book is out, it is clear what she meant.Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14.Field describes how being with Reynolds was \u0027exorcising something that needed to be exorcised\u0027 but she was \u0027trying to make it work this time\u0027.The actress writes that from the beginning Reynolds was presumptuous and arrogant, introducing himself as \u0027Burt Reynolds, movie star\u0027 when he called her. It was 1976 and he had asked her to star in Smokey and the Bandit she had already found fame with films like Gidget and Stay Hungry, while Reynolds was the biggest star in the world at the time, thanks to films like Deliverance.Field writes she did not understand why Reynolds wanted her in the film because she was not his typical leading lady and she thought that the \u0027script stinks\u0027.But his motives became clear when, to her surprise, he announced they were going on a date for their first meeting.Field writes: \u0027By the time we met, the weight of his stardom had become a way for Burt to control everyone around him, and from the moment I walked through the door, it was a way to control me. We were a perfect match of flaws\u0027.Their affair was \u0027instantaneous and intense\u0027, Field writes.          Field says that from the first time they met, Reynolds began to \u0027housebreak\u0027 her, telling her \u0027what was allowed and what was not\u0027          During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.          Field learned not to talk about previous lovers and later became \u0027terrified\u0027 of running into any man she knew, regardless of whether or not she was in a relationship with him priorDuring the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.Field writes: \u0027This could not have been a good thing and I couldn\u0027t understand why everyone around him acted so nonchalant while this man was writhing in pain, panicked that his heart was about to stop\u0027.Field gave Reynolds a brown paper bag to breathe into and wrapped hot towels around his feet, face and hands. Reynolds also used to routinely use Valium and the painkiller Percodan to get through the day.During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit, Field writes: \u0027He was zooming the car down narrow roads, barely able to see around the forest of equipment and spouting reams of dialogue while I fed him barbiturates hand over fist. Clearly I didn\u0027t have my wits about me\u0027.\u0027This would hurt him\u0027: Sally Field is relieved that Burt...Sally Field reveals she was repeatedly sexually abused by...Hidden agony of America\u0027s sweetheart: Sally Field was abused...\u0027It was instantaneous, four days felt like four years\u0027:...Share this articleHis episodes led Field to take Reynolds to the Miami Heart Institute for a checkup on his heart, which came back all clear.Reynolds dismissed her attempts to get him into therapy for his anxiety, which she thought was causing his heart palpitations, because he thought it was \u0027self-delusional poppycock\u0027.But Reynolds thought that drugs could cure Field\u0027s health issues, and when she had a headache he offered her a strong Percodan.When she asked for an aspirin instead, his voice turned to irritated impatience, which Field calls his \u0027how dare you doubt my know-how\u0027 tone.Field says the message he was sending her was \u0027do it now, go!\u0027 so she took the pill and felt sick with her heart pounding.           Reynolds dismissed her attempts to get him into therapy for his anxiety, which she thought was causing his heart palpitations, because he thought it was \u0027self-delusional poppycock\u0027          Field\u0027s verdict on Reynolds is that people saw him as a charming, funny, good ol\u0027 boy from the South but inside he was tortured.As the months went by Reynolds became \u0027louder, short-tempered and impatient,\u0027, she writes. Field was doing all the cooking and cleaning in his Los Angeles home, buying things and \u0027fulfilling every wish before he could even wish for it\u0027.She was paying for everything out of her own pocket but when she finally got up the courage to ask Reynolds for some money, he refused.He said: \u0027My business manager gives me only a thousand dollars a week. If I give you two hundred that\u0027ll leave me with almost nothing\u0027.Field does talk about good times in their relationship like how Reynolds was an early adapter to the VHS player and that he gave her films such as The Searchers - the John Wayne western.Field writes about how with film made them \u0027love something together, which made us love each other\u0027.But Reynolds did not gel well with Field\u0027s two children, Peter, who was seven at the time, and Eli, who was four.He bought them go-karts for Christmas but they did not want to be bribed and his attempts to charm them \u0027flopped like a juicy fart at a family reunion\u0027.Reynolds became \u0027uncomfortable\u0027 around them so Field left them at home with her mother while she spent evenings with him, staying overnight and driving back early the next day.Field writes how she became \u0027overwhelmed with guilt\u0027 at neglecting her children for Reynolds ironically when she was with him she felt \u0027more trapped than with my children\u0027. When press reports began about Reynolds\u0027 cheating, Field\u0027s grandmother made sure she knew about it, calling her to report what was in the National Enquirer that week, and described the photos.           Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, actor Jock Mahoney (pictured with him and her brother Rick in 1952), who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14          Jock Mahoney (pictured with Sally and her brother) was a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard          Field (pictured in 1967) writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027Field tried to brush it off but secretly she \u0027knew it was all true\u0027. She writes that she \u0027felt duped and a fool\u0027 but, still she stayed with Reynolds.Field writes that \u0027to be loved I had to stop being me\u0027 and in her journals at the time she wrote about wanting to \u0027run away, to escape from some hidden trap\u0027.She was \u0027bending myself into a pleasing shape, a soothing compliant cup of warm elixir that Burt was then lured into drinking over and over, until he became addicted to the seemingly unconditional love I was offering\u0027, she writes.The biggest role of Field\u0027s career was Norma Rae in 1979, about a textile factory worker who rallies her co-workers to unionize.Inevitably Reynolds objected to the role and told Field that \u0027no lady of mine is gonna play a whore\u0027. When Field said it was just a part she was playing, Reynolds mocked her, saying: \u0027Oh, so now you\u0027re an actor... you\u0027re letting your ambition get the better of you\u0027.Field defied him and took the part and on the last day of filming Reynolds drove to see her on the set and proposed with a diamond ring, which Field describes as \u0027not me\u0027. Field did not accept his proposal and they never married. She writes how Reynolds \u0027didn\u0027t speak and I didn\u0027t know what to say other than thank you, awkwardly\u0027. After Norma Rae finished filming, Field writes that her personality started to \u0027flare out\u0027, which was met with Reynolds\u0027 \u0027shocked disapproval\u0027. Field writes: \u0027As I began pulling away he tightened his grip, sometimes literally\u0027.           Field writes that Reynolds was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027            Burt Reynolds, who passed away on September 6, had a torrid romance with Sally Field for five-years starting when the co-starred in Smokey and the Bandit (pictured, 1977            After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the bookWhen she called him to say she was going to the Cannes Film Festival he \u0027asked in a huff what the hell I intended to do there\u0027, branding it a \u0027waste of time\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 tone changed to \u0027deep disappointment\u0027 and he said that he had been house hunting for both of them and that she was \u0027spoiling it\u0027 for him.When Field couldn\u0027t be \u0027bullied or seduced\u0027 into changing her mind, Reynolds lashed out and said: \u0027You don\u0027t expect to win anything, do you?\u0027 and slammed the phone down.On the plane to France she describes a feeling of being \u0027wondrously free\u0027. And at Cannes, Field won the Palme d\u0027Or for best actress and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress that year.Field\u0027s verdict on Reynolds is that people saw him as a charming, funny, good ol\u0027 boy from the South but inside he was tortured.She writes that he was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027.She writes: \u0027He also couldn\u0027t talk about it, couldn\u0027t articulate how it made him feel both empowered and terrified\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 fans saw him as the \u0027quintessential definition of masculine pulchritude\u0027 but according to Field: \u0027The human inside that dream figure was just a good-looking, ordinary person frantically trying to fulfill everyone\u0027s expectations\u0027,           Sally Field\u0027s revealing memoir \u0027In Pieces\u0027 (pictured) is set to hit stands September 18Field tells how when Reynolds was a senior in high school and playing on the varsity football team he cried on the pitch after winning the state championship.But his father came on the field and slapped him because, in his eyes, he was not behaving like a man.Field writes that Reynolds \u0027spent his life trying to prove to his father that he was a man worth loving\u0027. Field adds: \u0027He tried to hide everything about himself that he saw as being imperfect, to camouflage himself, which meant he got locked into a stressful trap of faking it\u0027.After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the book.She said: \u0027This would hurt him.\u0027I felt glad that he wasn\u0027t going to read it, he wasn\u0027t going to be asked about it, and he wasn\u0027t going to have to defend himself or lash out, which he probably would have. I did not want to hurt him any further\u0027.Before the book\u0027s publication Field gave an interview to the New York Times which she revealed that the stepfather who abused her was Jock Mahoney, a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard.Recounting the episode she writes: \u0027I felt both a child, helpless, and not a child. Powerful. This was power. And I owned it. But I wanted to be a child.\u0027Field writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027.In 1968 Field got stoned with singer songwriter Jimmy Webb, passed out and woke up to find him \u0027on top of me, grinding away to another melody\u0027.Webb denied the encounter took place.While auditioning for the role of Mary Tate Farnsworth in the 1976 film \u0027Stay Hungry\u0027 Field said that director Bob Rafelson demanded she kiss him and said that \u0027I can\u0027t hire anyone who doesn\u0027t kiss good enough\u0027. Sally Field speaks out about her new memoir, \u0027In Pieces\u0027 Video - ABC News"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/14/50214AD000000578-6180733-image-a-14_1537277545387.jpg","title":"Midterms 2018 need know November elections","story":"    The fate of the U.S. Congress hangs in the balance as the 2018 midterm elections loom largeWhat are midterm elections?Midterm elections in the United States are elections held on a quadrennial basis every four years during the midpoint of a U.S. President’s four-year office term.In the United States, all 50 states receive two Senate seats irrespective of their population for a total of 100 seats while the 435 House of Representatives seats are delegated based on population, with a larger state such as California receiving far more representation in the chamber than states with much smaller populations like Wyoming, Vermont and Delaware.All 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives are contested in midterm elections, while 33 to 34 Senate seats out of 100 total are also up for grabs, meaning that midterm elections can have a major impact on which party controls Congress.Midterm elections also have a key impact on state and local level politics, as 36 out of the 50 governorships in the U.S. hold elections during the midterms while many mayoral elections are also held throughout the U.S.Historically, turnout for midterm elections in the United States has been lower than presidential elections, with roughly 40 percent of eligible voters going to the polls as opposed to 50 to 60 per cent for presidential elections.In addition, the President’s party typically loses seats during most midterm elections, with notable examples being the ‘Republican Revolution’ of 1994 in which the Republican Party took control of Congress and the 2006 midterm elections, which saw the Democrats seize control of both houses of Congress in what was seen as a major rebuke to former President George W. Bush.In the United States, more rural areas tend to favor the Republican Party while more urban, erse areas typically favor the Democratic Party.When are the 2018 midterm elections?The 2018 midterm elections will be held on Tuesday, November 6.          The election will soon have a major impact on political issues like taxes, immigration and moreSenateThe Republicans currently hold a narrow 51 seat majority in the Senate and are facing strong headwinds, though have one clear advantage: the Democrats will be on the defensive. The Democratic Party is currently defending 26 seats while the Republican Party is only defending nine, possibly giving them an edge going into the election.The Senate will see a number of key elections to watch closely as the 2018 midterms draw near.One key race is in Arizona for the seat held by the late Senator John McCain, which is currently being targeted by the Democrats for a potential pickup. Republican candidate Martha McSally is thought to face a tough challenge from Democratic candidate Kyrsten Sinema.The state’s shifting demographics, notably its large and growing Latino population, and isions between traditional Republicans like McCain and pro-Trump populists have threatened to weaken the Republicans’ long-held grip on the state.Other key Senate races to keep an eye on include a surprisingly competitive race between sitting Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke, who only narrowly trails Cruz according to most polls in the traditionally-Republican state.In Nevada, Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Dean Heller are locked in a tight race, as are Republican Josh Hawley and Democrat Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Democrat Phil Bredesen and Republican Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee, another traditionally-Republican state.In Florida, one of the most famous bellwether states in the U.S., the race between Democrat Bill Nelson and Rick Scott is also extremely competitive.House of RepresentativesThough the Republicans currently control the House of Representatives, the Democrats are seen as having a strong chance to retake the congressional chamber, needing 24 seats to gain majority control of it.Republicans currently hold 240 seats compared to 195 for the Democrats.However, over the past 50 years, the Democrats have only gained more than 24 seats twice: in 1974, in the wake of the infamous Watergate scandal, and in 2006, when opposition to former President George W. Bush over the Iraq War reached a fever pitch.Fortunately for the Democrats, a record 39 sitting Republicans in the House of Representatives have opted to not seek reelection, giving them a chance to pick up seats in many states, including longtime swing states like Pennsylvania and Florida.A key race to watch closely is in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, where Democrat Conor Lamb stunned observers to win a special election in March 2018 for a seat that had been held by Republicans from 2003 to 2017 and was considered to be in Trump-friendly territory.Lamb will now be facing off against Republican Keith Rothfus after court-ordered redistricting in a new district that’s thought to be considerably friendlier to the Democrats.          Democrat Beto O\u0027Rourke is putting up a very strong challenge against Texas Senator Ted Cruz GovernorsKey races are also slated to get underway at the gubernatorial level as Democrats and Republicans face off in key swing states like Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Colorado.Republicans currently hold 33 governorships, although the Democrats are looking to build on their anticipated momentum and make gains at the state level as well as in Congress.A key race to watch is in Florida, as Democrat Andrew Gillum, fresh off an upset victory in the primaries, is looking to become the first African-American to become governors of the state. The outspoken progressive and Tallahassee mayor will face off against Republican Representative Ron DeSantis, a vocal proponent of Donald Trump’s policies.Other notable races to watch closely include competitive elections in Georgia, where Democrat Stacy Abrams is looking to become the first African-American woman to win a gubernatorial race in the U.S. as she faces off against Republican Brian Kemp and in the swing state of Iowa, where Republican Kim Reynolds is locked in a tight battle with Democrat Fred Hubbell.2018 midterm election predictionsThough the 2018 midterm election is still several weeks away, both historical and current trends have helped pollsters and election prognosticators draw up what they believe is a likely scenario for the outcome of the election.Given the fact that the sitting President’s party generally loses seats in midterm elections and President Donald Trump is hobbled by fairly low approval ratings, many election forecasters believe that the upcoming election will produce strong results for the Democrats and favor them taking at least one house of Congress, both of which are currently controlled by the Republicans.According to FiveThirtyEight, the Senate has a more than 67 percent chance to remain in Republican hands as of September 17. This is largely due to the fact that the Democrats have to defend a much wider range of seats during the election, including ones in states won by Trump in the 2016 election.Having to defend so many seats could blunt the ‘blue wave’ that many election forecasters have predicted for the Democrats and possibly leave the Senate in Republican control, though many races are thought to be especially competitive and could easily swing one way or another.The Democrats are thought to have much better odds in the House of Representatives, where FiveThirtyEight is forecasting the Democrats’ chances of retaking the chamber of more than 82 percent as of September 17.Although the Republicans currently have a solid majority of 240 seats, the Democrats have a clear historical advantage and are also buoyed by strong and persistent opposition to Trump, meaning that their odds of retaking the chamber are considerably higher than in the Senate.Denis Norden dead: TV presenter and comedy writer\u0026#8217s best jokes revealedGreat British Bake off fans want to know where Terry is Midterms 2018: All you need to know about the November electionsDancing on Ice 2019: Cast rumours, start date and moreGeorge RR Martin net worth: Game of Thrones writer\u0027s wealth revealed after Emmys winEuroMillions results: National Lottery numbers for Tuesday, 18 SeptemberWho is Mrs Hinch?

Ms Spielman said the curriculum is a \u0027yardstick\u0027 for what school leaders want their pupils to know\u0027Pupil attainment and qualifications will always remain important as one measure of a school\u0027s effectiveness, and of course hugely important to young people themselves.\u0027From next autumn, inspectors will look much more closely at how a rounded curriculum is being delivered and Ms Spielman said a good curriculum gives a school purpose.\u0027Ultimately, the curriculum is the yardstick for what school leaders want their pupils to know and to be able to do by the time they leave school.\u0027It is therefore imperative that the new inspection framework has the curriculum as a central focus.\u0027Ms Spielman went on to highlight that, while the national curriculum \u0027provides us with an important benchmark\u0027, the way it is delivered should be up for the schools and school leaders to decide.\u0027It should depend on a number of factors relevant to a particular school\u0027s context and the knowledge and expertise of curriculum leaders.\u0027In response to this, Geoff Barton, general-secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u0027We support, in principle, Ofsted\u0027s intention to focus more on the curriculum and less on test and exam results.\u0027Done well, it has the potential to liberate schools and teachers from the grinding pressure of preparing for Sats in primary schools and GCSEs in secondary schools, and feel empowered to concentrate more on a broad, balanced and rich curriculum.\u0027Our concern, however, is that this does not translate into an Ofsted-prescribed curriculum, and we are reassured by the chief inspector\u0027s commentary which recognises the importance of schools having the autonomy to choose the curriculum which most benefits their students.\u0027It is essential that the new Ofsted framework champions the distinctiveness of schools to serve the needs of their communities.\u0027  HMCI commentary: curriculum and the new education inspection framework - GOV.UK"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/16/4EABD51300000578-0-image-m-17_1533136441030.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER Lets salute King Punk John Lydon letting hang out","story":"    Janet Street-Porter met John Lydon over 42 years ago in 1976, when he and the newly formed Sex Pistols played at a Valentine’s Day party in a loft by London’s Tower Bridge          janet Street Porter and Johnny Rotten in 1978.

We are so used to the likes of Rod Steward on a carefully choreographed airport stroll (for the press, naturally) complete with loving wife holding his hand, (she probably selected his on-trend Gucci slippers), perfectly pressed trousers and precisely ruffled hair, that Johnny Lydon’s tramp-like persona comes a bit of a rude reality check.

This is what sixty-something men look like when they can drink large amounts of beer without a partner giving them the ‘forget it’ stare. This is what men of a certain age look like when they are away from home and can eat the crap they really like (fast food full of grease and carbs- which is all you can get anyway at 11pm after a gig and you’ve signed hundreds of autographs and posed for selfies).John does look as if touring with his band and publicising a new documentary (The Public Image is Rotten) has impacted on his waistline. It might have expanded but I very much doubt there’s be much change in his mental outlook- this isn’t someone who is going to turn into a docile pensioner any day soon.We met back over 42 years ago in 1976, when he and the newly formed Sex Pistols played at a Valentine’s Day party in a loft by London’s Tower Bridge. It was early days- the band sounded appalling, and their performance came to an abrupt end when the PA system failed. The road crew started to fight with the sound technicians and I left before it got nasty.That autumn, I made a television documentary about the rise of Punk Rock, filming the Clash and then the Sex Pistols- it was to be their first TV appearance. I tried to film an interview with John in a squat in Soho and got a stuffed rat chucked at my head as he spouted ‘I don’t have no heroes, they’re all useless’. What an anthem for anyone under 21, back in the days when Maggie Thatcher was leader of the Tory party and the British government was male, middle aged and mediocre- not to mention white.          Janet Street-Porter\u0027s television documentary gave Johnny Rotten his first television exposureThat footage has now been shown around the world, along with the Sex Pistols’ performance in a church hall we hired for the occasion. Lydon’s stage presence was simply electrifying- and Elton John rang me one Sunday, asking to meet to discuss the revolution that was going on in pop music. Elton was totally bowled over by punk, realising that nothing in pop would be the same again.John Lydon didn’t just take on the establishment with hits like God Save the Queen, his alternative National Anthem (which topped the charts in the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Year in 1977) and Anarchy in the UK, he sent shock waves through the world of popular music- he mouthed off about Queen and ‘pomp’ rock, played in a pubs and small village halls where kids could get up close- everything mega stars like Rod Stewart had left behind long ago.          John Lydon aka Jonny Rotten performing with The Sex Pistols in 1977I’ve known him through three of my marriages, while he’s always been devoted to one partner for almost 40 years. Nora has been his rock and his soul mate, a woman who shuns the limelight and gets on with her life. A man of many contradictions, a shy sensitive soul who carefully keeps that aspect of his personality hidden, a loud mouth who can terrify any hard-bitten interviewer with one withering F*** off.

More than 40,000 people in the UK are thought to die early every year because of air pollution.Earlier this week, scientists revealed they had found tiny particles of vehicle soot in the wombs of pregnant women, suggesting even unborn babies are at risk.The lead author of the new research, Professor Frank Kelly, calculated 7 per cent of cases of dementia could be attributed to air pollution. If applied to the 850,000 cases in the UK, his figures suggest 60,000 cases could be prevented if air pollution was eradicated.Professor Kelly, of King\u0027s College London and a government adviser on air pollution, said: \u0027This is a very serious problem. The more we look at all the chronic diseases in society, the more air pollution crops up as a recurring factor.\u0027We\u0027re not saying air pollution is the only cause of dementia. But by tackling air pollution, even if you merely delayed the onset of dementia, that would be of enormous benefit for families and the health service.\u0027The research team, whose findings were published in the BMJ Open medical journal last night, tracked 131,000 people aged 50 to 79 living within Greater London, and followed them for seven years.Using participants\u0027 postcodes, they looked at air pollution data and compared it to their health records. They found people living in the most polluted areas were far more likely to develop dementia.          As part of the study 131,000 people aged 50 to 79 living in the Greater London area were analysedThose living in areas with the highest 20 per cent of nitrogen dioxide emissions had a 40 per cent increased dementia risk. Diesel cars – particularly the older models – produce far more nitrogen dioxide than petrol vehicles.The scientists also found that people with the highest 20 per cent exposure to microscopic sooty particles – also linked to diesel – had a 26 per cent increased risk of dementia.Professor Kelly, who chairs the Department of Health\u0027s committee on the medical effects of air pollution, said: \u0027On the road, older diesel vehicles are by far the most polluting. It\u0027s not just cars – it\u0027s the buses and the taxis.\u0027Although the study focused only on people living within the M25, experts are convinced it is representative of the whole country.A wipe with a face cloth instead of a shower, unable to see...\u0027We realised things weren¿t going to be fine\u0027: Wife whose...Share this articleThe UK is notoriously bad at controlling air pollution, with 37 cities persistently displaying illegal levels and the Government repeatedly being hauled into court over the past few years.Simon Alcock, of environmental law firm ClientEarth, said: \u0027Air pollution is damaging our health from the womb to old age. It is unacceptable in 2018 for people to be risking dementia just by breathing. We need big, bold action from the Government to clean up the air and protect our health.\u0027The microscopic particles in air pollution are breathed deep into the lungs and enter the blood stream. Scientists believe they then travel into the brain where they provoke inflammation – a problem which may trigger dementia.          Several car giants including BMW, Mercedes and VW among others are being investigated over the emissions technologyThe commission said it would examine whether the group agreed to avoid competing against each other in the race to install \u0027clean emission devices\u0027 in diesel and petrol cars sold throughout Europe.Emissions-cutting devices are expensive and push up the cost of building cars, meaning there would have been a financial incentive for manufacturers to drag their heels.The European commission said if car makers did conspire with each other, this would amount to a breach of the EU\u0027s anti-trust rules which outlaw cartels.Commissioner Margrethe Vestager added: \u0027If proven, this collusion may have denied consumers the opportunity to buy less polluting cars, despite the technology being available to the manufacturers.\u0027VW, Daimler and BMW said they would continue to co-operate with the commission\u0027s investigation but could not comment on the ongoing case.                                                    \u0027Greater investment is also needed in alternatives to motor vehicles, such as safer cycling infrastructure, and affordable and convenient public transport.\u0027But Dr James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer\u0027s Society, pointed out that the research had looked only at the chance of developing dementia, and had not actually proved that the pollution had caused the illness. \u0027There is evidence that exposure to air pollution can cause small particles to enter the brain, but it\u0027s a huge leap to say that air pollution could lead to dementia and this study had several limitations,\u0027 he said.A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u0027Air pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and while air quality has improved significantly since 2010, we recognise there is more to do.\u0027This is why we have put in place a £3.5 billion plan to reduce harmful emissions from road transport and have launched an ambitious Clean Air Strategy which has been commended by the World Health Organisation.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/00/5052342200000578-0-image-a-10_1537226803323.jpg","title":"TV wildlife presenter Chris Packham calls primary schools twinned farms","story":"    Chris Packham (pictured)  has called for primary schools to be \u0027twinned\u0027 with farms across the UKHomeowner who shot dead a council official on live TV over...Blundering government officials use photos of SLOVENIA in...Is a BACKPACKER the strawberry saboteur?

Unilever claims to have found a way that would allow British investors to carry on getting payouts without paying the tax.But investors fear the Dutch authorities could close the loophole.

Pictured:  The couple together on the set of Hooper in 1978              The Oscar-winning actress (pictured on Monday) has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died on September 6 aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoirField has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died earlier this month aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoir. And now that the book is out, it is clear what she meant.Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14.Field describes how being with Reynolds was \u0027exorcising something that needed to be exorcised\u0027 but she was \u0027trying to make it work this time\u0027.The actress writes that from the beginning Reynolds was presumptuous and arrogant, introducing himself as \u0027Burt Reynolds, movie star\u0027 when he called her. It was 1976 and he had asked her to star in Smokey and the Bandit she had already found fame with films like Gidget and Stay Hungry, while Reynolds was the biggest star in the world at the time, thanks to films like Deliverance.Field writes she did not understand why Reynolds wanted her in the film because she was not his typical leading lady and she thought that the \u0027script stinks\u0027.But his motives became clear when, to her surprise, he announced they were going on a date for their first meeting.Field writes: \u0027By the time we met, the weight of his stardom had become a way for Burt to control everyone around him, and from the moment I walked through the door, it was a way to control me. We were a perfect match of flaws\u0027.Their affair was \u0027instantaneous and intense\u0027, Field writes.          Field says that from the first time they met, Reynolds began to \u0027housebreak\u0027 her, telling her \u0027what was allowed and what was not\u0027          During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.          Field learned not to talk about previous lovers and later became \u0027terrified\u0027 of running into any man she knew, regardless of whether or not she was in a relationship with him priorDuring the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.Field writes: \u0027This could not have been a good thing and I couldn\u0027t understand why everyone around him acted so nonchalant while this man was writhing in pain, panicked that his heart was about to stop\u0027.Field gave Reynolds a brown paper bag to breathe into and wrapped hot towels around his feet, face and hands. Reynolds also used to routinely use Valium and the painkiller Percodan to get through the day.During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit, Field writes: \u0027He was zooming the car down narrow roads, barely able to see around the forest of equipment and spouting reams of dialogue while I fed him barbiturates hand over fist.

If I give you two hundred that\u0027ll leave me with almost nothing\u0027.Field does talk about good times in their relationship like how Reynolds was an early adapter to the VHS player and that he gave her films such as The Searchers - the John Wayne western.Field writes about how with film made them \u0027love something together, which made us love each other\u0027.But Reynolds did not gel well with Field\u0027s two children, Peter, who was seven at the time, and Eli, who was four.He bought them go-karts for Christmas but they did not want to be bribed and his attempts to charm them \u0027flopped like a juicy fart at a family reunion\u0027.Reynolds became \u0027uncomfortable\u0027 around them so Field left them at home with her mother while she spent evenings with him, staying overnight and driving back early the next day.Field writes how she became \u0027overwhelmed with guilt\u0027 at neglecting her children for Reynolds ironically when she was with him she felt \u0027more trapped than with my children\u0027. When press reports began about Reynolds\u0027 cheating, Field\u0027s grandmother made sure she knew about it, calling her to report what was in the National Enquirer that week, and described the photos.           Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, actor Jock Mahoney (pictured with him and her brother Rick in 1952), who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14          Jock Mahoney (pictured with Sally and her brother) was a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard          Field (pictured in 1967) writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027Field tried to brush it off but secretly she \u0027knew it was all true\u0027. She writes that she \u0027felt duped and a fool\u0027 but, still she stayed with Reynolds.Field writes that \u0027to be loved I had to stop being me\u0027 and in her journals at the time she wrote about wanting to \u0027run away, to escape from some hidden trap\u0027.She was \u0027bending myself into a pleasing shape, a soothing compliant cup of warm elixir that Burt was then lured into drinking over and over, until he became addicted to the seemingly unconditional love I was offering\u0027, she writes.The biggest role of Field\u0027s career was Norma Rae in 1979, about a textile factory worker who rallies her co-workers to unionize.Inevitably Reynolds objected to the role and told Field that \u0027no lady of mine is gonna play a whore\u0027. When Field said it was just a part she was playing, Reynolds mocked her, saying: \u0027Oh, so now you\u0027re an actor... you\u0027re letting your ambition get the better of you\u0027.Field defied him and took the part and on the last day of filming Reynolds drove to see her on the set and proposed with a diamond ring, which Field describes as \u0027not me\u0027. Field did not accept his proposal and they never married. She writes how Reynolds \u0027didn\u0027t speak and I didn\u0027t know what to say other than thank you, awkwardly\u0027. After Norma Rae finished filming, Field writes that her personality started to \u0027flare out\u0027, which was met with Reynolds\u0027 \u0027shocked disapproval\u0027. Field writes: \u0027As I began pulling away he tightened his grip, sometimes literally\u0027.           Field writes that Reynolds was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027            Burt Reynolds, who passed away on September 6, had a torrid romance with Sally Field for five-years starting when the co-starred in Smokey and the Bandit (pictured, 1977            After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the bookWhen she called him to say she was going to the Cannes Film Festival he \u0027asked in a huff what the hell I intended to do there\u0027, branding it a \u0027waste of time\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 tone changed to \u0027deep disappointment\u0027 and he said that he had been house hunting for both of them and that she was \u0027spoiling it\u0027 for him.When Field couldn\u0027t be \u0027bullied or seduced\u0027 into changing her mind, Reynolds lashed out and said: \u0027You don\u0027t expect to win anything, do you?\u0027 and slammed the phone down.On the plane to France she describes a feeling of being \u0027wondrously free\u0027. And at Cannes, Field won the Palme d\u0027Or for best actress and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress that year.Field\u0027s verdict on Reynolds is that people saw him as a charming, funny, good ol\u0027 boy from the South but inside he was tortured.She writes that he was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027.She writes: \u0027He also couldn\u0027t talk about it, couldn\u0027t articulate how it made him feel both empowered and terrified\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 fans saw him as the \u0027quintessential definition of masculine pulchritude\u0027 but according to Field: \u0027The human inside that dream figure was just a good-looking, ordinary person frantically trying to fulfill everyone\u0027s expectations\u0027,           Sally Field\u0027s revealing memoir \u0027In Pieces\u0027 (pictured) is set to hit stands September 18Field tells how when Reynolds was a senior in high school and playing on the varsity football team he cried on the pitch after winning the state championship.But his father came on the field and slapped him because, in his eyes, he was not behaving like a man.Field writes that Reynolds \u0027spent his life trying to prove to his father that he was a man worth loving\u0027. Field adds: \u0027He tried to hide everything about himself that he saw as being imperfect, to camouflage himself, which meant he got locked into a stressful trap of faking it\u0027.After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the book.She said: \u0027This would hurt him.\u0027I felt glad that he wasn\u0027t going to read it, he wasn\u0027t going to be asked about it, and he wasn\u0027t going to have to defend himself or lash out, which he probably would have. I did not want to hurt him any further\u0027.Before the book\u0027s publication Field gave an interview to the New York Times which she revealed that the stepfather who abused her was Jock Mahoney, a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard.Recounting the episode she writes: \u0027I felt both a child, helpless, and not a child. Powerful. This was power. And I owned it. But I wanted to be a child.\u0027Field writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027.In 1968 Field got stoned with singer songwriter Jimmy Webb, passed out and woke up to find him \u0027on top of me, grinding away to another melody\u0027.Webb denied the encounter took place.While auditioning for the role of Mary Tate Farnsworth in the 1976 film \u0027Stay Hungry\u0027 Field said that director Bob Rafelson demanded she kiss him and said that \u0027I can\u0027t hire anyone who doesn\u0027t kiss good enough\u0027. Sally Field speaks out about her new memoir, \u0027In Pieces\u0027 Video - ABC News"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/11/4D5DD1A300000578-0-image-m-10_1529317344598.jpg","title":"Spotted Two 200k Bentley GT Convertibles seen time British roads","story":"    Seen for the first time on British roads, two 200mph soft-top Bentley GT Convertibles  were spotted driving in convoy and then parked  on a factory road-test on the A40 near Oxford today          The two top secret but only lightly disguised Bentley convertibles – both with their soft-top hoods in place and painted in a black and grey horizontal tiger stripe pattern - were part of a seven strong convoy of vehicles seen driving though the Cotswolds in GloucestershireFaster Eight: The BMW 8 Series is back - and it\u0027s set to...Share this articleThe convoy included three Bentley Bentayga 4X4s (two gold, one white), a blue Bentley Continental GT hard-top and an Audi A3 hatchback.Bentley engineers were surprised and not wholly pleased when MailOnline recognised the two top secret cars and began photographing them parked in a large layby in Oxfordshire. One of the Bentley team said: ’Would you mind not taking photographs of our cars.’But parked up on a public highway, they were in the public place and therefore fair game to be photographed.Belatedly they attempted to block the view of one of the cars as two of the large golden 4X4s provided an honour guard for the convertible. However, by then the pictures were already in the can.At the beginning of September a disguised GT convertible was photographed in a spy-shot during high speed tests on Germany’s Nurburgring circuit. But this is believed to be the first time the car has been seen in public on UK roads.The third generation of the Bentley GT was unveiled last August (2017) ahead of its public debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September and first deliveries in Spring this year.It is the most hi-tech Bentley ever launched with the world’s first three-way rotating dashboard that takes its inspiration from James Bond’s famous revolving number plate. A clever triangular ‘Toblerone-style’ device showing three different dashboard ‘faces’ allows the driver to choose which one to view.It is inspired by the rotating number-plate gadget used in the James Bond movie ‘Goldfinger’ on 007’s gadget-laden Aston Martin DB5 – using three-sided faces, like on the distinctive triangular packaging of the Toblerone bar of chocolate.    The convoy included three Bentley Bentayga 4X4s (two gold, one white), a blue Bentley Continental GT hard-top and an Audi A3 hatchbackThe new third generation 207mph Bentley Continental GT costs £160,000 and is built in Britain at the firm’s factory in Crewe which employs 4,000 people. Some 66,000 have been sold since the first was launched in 2003, with the second generation in 2011.It accelerates from rest to 60mph in just 3.6 seconds – 0.7 seconds faster than its predecessor - thanks to its powerful and enhanced 6.0-litre W12 turbo-charged petrol engine developing 626 brake-horsepower (635PS) and linked to a slick new eight-speed dual-clutch automatic gear-box. Top speed is 9mph faster than the outgoing car. Fittingly, the braking system is the most powerful system ever fitted to a Bentley, with a total of 28 pistons.But it’s a bit of a gas-guzzler and averages just 23.2mpg, dropping to 16.0mpg around town.But Bentley bosses aim to make Bentleys ‘greener’ with electric hybrid and fully electric versin. It took the first step at this year’s Geneva Motor Show in March when it unveiled the new £140,000 petrol-electric Bentayga Hybrid sports utility vehicle which the firm is dubbing ‘the world’s first luxury hybrid’.          The new third generation 207mph Bentley Continental GT costs £160,000 and is built in Britain at the firm’s factory in Crewe which employs 4,000 peopleBut new chief executive and ‘Bentley Boy’ Adrian Hallmark stressed that this is ‘just the start’ and represents Bentley’s first step towards ‘full electrification’ of the Bentley range as the firm seeks to shed its ‘gas-guzzler’ reputation.Hallmark’s stated aim is to have 100 per cent hybrid or electric power available on all models across the Bentley range by 2025.

Ms Spielman said the curriculum is a \u0027yardstick\u0027 for what school leaders want their pupils to know\u0027Pupil attainment and qualifications will always remain important as one measure of a school\u0027s effectiveness, and of course hugely important to young people themselves.\u0027From next autumn, inspectors will look much more closely at how a rounded curriculum is being delivered and Ms Spielman said a good curriculum gives a school purpose.\u0027Ultimately, the curriculum is the yardstick for what school leaders want their pupils to know and to be able to do by the time they leave school.\u0027It is therefore imperative that the new inspection framework has the curriculum as a central focus.\u0027Ms Spielman went on to highlight that, while the national curriculum \u0027provides us with an important benchmark\u0027, the way it is delivered should be up for the schools and school leaders to decide.\u0027It should depend on a number of factors relevant to a particular school\u0027s context and the knowledge and expertise of curriculum leaders.\u0027In response to this, Geoff Barton, general-secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u0027We support, in principle, Ofsted\u0027s intention to focus more on the curriculum and less on test and exam results.\u0027Done well, it has the potential to liberate schools and teachers from the grinding pressure of preparing for Sats in primary schools and GCSEs in secondary schools, and feel empowered to concentrate more on a broad, balanced and rich curriculum.\u0027Our concern, however, is that this does not translate into an Ofsted-prescribed curriculum, and we are reassured by the chief inspector\u0027s commentary which recognises the importance of schools having the autonomy to choose the curriculum which most benefits their students.\u0027It is essential that the new Ofsted framework champions the distinctiveness of schools to serve the needs of their communities.\u0027  HMCI commentary: curriculum and the new education inspection framework - GOV.UK"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/16/4EABD51300000578-0-image-m-17_1533136441030.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER Lets salute King Punk John Lydon letting hang out","story":"    Janet Street-Porter met John Lydon over 42 years ago in 1976, when he and the newly formed Sex Pistols played at a Valentine’s Day party in a loft by London’s Tower Bridge          janet Street Porter and Johnny Rotten in 1978.

We are so used to the likes of Rod Steward on a carefully choreographed airport stroll (for the press, naturally) complete with loving wife holding his hand, (she probably selected his on-trend Gucci slippers), perfectly pressed trousers and precisely ruffled hair, that Johnny Lydon’s tramp-like persona comes a bit of a rude reality check.

This is what sixty-something men look like when they can drink large amounts of beer without a partner giving them the ‘forget it’ stare. This is what men of a certain age look like when they are away from home and can eat the crap they really like (fast food full of grease and carbs- which is all you can get anyway at 11pm after a gig and you’ve signed hundreds of autographs and posed for selfies).John does look as if touring with his band and publicising a new documentary (The Public Image is Rotten) has impacted on his waistline. It might have expanded but I very much doubt there’s be much change in his mental outlook- this isn’t someone who is going to turn into a docile pensioner any day soon.We met back over 42 years ago in 1976, when he and the newly formed Sex Pistols played at a Valentine’s Day party in a loft by London’s Tower Bridge. It was early days- the band sounded appalling, and their performance came to an abrupt end when the PA system failed. The road crew started to fight with the sound technicians and I left before it got nasty.That autumn, I made a television documentary about the rise of Punk Rock, filming the Clash and then the Sex Pistols- it was to be their first TV appearance. I tried to film an interview with John in a squat in Soho and got a stuffed rat chucked at my head as he spouted ‘I don’t have no heroes, they’re all useless’. What an anthem for anyone under 21, back in the days when Maggie Thatcher was leader of the Tory party and the British government was male, middle aged and mediocre- not to mention white.          Janet Street-Porter\u0027s television documentary gave Johnny Rotten his first television exposureThat footage has now been shown around the world, along with the Sex Pistols’ performance in a church hall we hired for the occasion. Lydon’s stage presence was simply electrifying- and Elton John rang me one Sunday, asking to meet to discuss the revolution that was going on in pop music. Elton was totally bowled over by punk, realising that nothing in pop would be the same again.John Lydon didn’t just take on the establishment with hits like God Save the Queen, his alternative National Anthem (which topped the charts in the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Year in 1977) and Anarchy in the UK, he sent shock waves through the world of popular music- he mouthed off about Queen and ‘pomp’ rock, played in a pubs and small village halls where kids could get up close- everything mega stars like Rod Stewart had left behind long ago.          John Lydon aka Jonny Rotten performing with The Sex Pistols in 1977I’ve known him through three of my marriages, while he’s always been devoted to one partner for almost 40 years. Nora has been his rock and his soul mate, a woman who shuns the limelight and gets on with her life. A man of many contradictions, a shy sensitive soul who carefully keeps that aspect of his personality hidden, a loud mouth who can terrify any hard-bitten interviewer with one withering F*** off. From Vogue to your local newspaper, he doesn’t discriminate, but behind that belligerent façade lurks a highly intelligent bloke.At my 50th birthday guests like Stephen Fry, Ruby Wax and Ian McKellen and the boss of the BBC all queued up to be insulted by the king of Punk.

More than 40,000 people in the UK are thought to die early every year because of air pollution.Earlier this week, scientists revealed they had found tiny particles of vehicle soot in the wombs of pregnant women, suggesting even unborn babies are at risk.The lead author of the new research, Professor Frank Kelly, calculated 7 per cent of cases of dementia could be attributed to air pollution. If applied to the 850,000 cases in the UK, his figures suggest 60,000 cases could be prevented if air pollution was eradicated.Professor Kelly, of King\u0027s College London and a government adviser on air pollution, said: \u0027This is a very serious problem. The more we look at all the chronic diseases in society, the more air pollution crops up as a recurring factor.\u0027We\u0027re not saying air pollution is the only cause of dementia. But by tackling air pollution, even if you merely delayed the onset of dementia, that would be of enormous benefit for families and the health service.\u0027The research team, whose findings were published in the BMJ Open medical journal last night, tracked 131,000 people aged 50 to 79 living within Greater London, and followed them for seven years.Using participants\u0027 postcodes, they looked at air pollution data and compared it to their health records. They found people living in the most polluted areas were far more likely to develop dementia.          As part of the study 131,000 people aged 50 to 79 living in the Greater London area were analysedThose living in areas with the highest 20 per cent of nitrogen dioxide emissions had a 40 per cent increased dementia risk. Diesel cars – particularly the older models – produce far more nitrogen dioxide than petrol vehicles.The scientists also found that people with the highest 20 per cent exposure to microscopic sooty particles – also linked to diesel – had a 26 per cent increased risk of dementia.Professor Kelly, who chairs the Department of Health\u0027s committee on the medical effects of air pollution, said: \u0027On the road, older diesel vehicles are by far the most polluting. It\u0027s not just cars – it\u0027s the buses and the taxis.\u0027Although the study focused only on people living within the M25, experts are convinced it is representative of the whole country.A wipe with a face cloth instead of a shower, unable to see...\u0027We realised things weren¿t going to be fine\u0027: Wife whose...Share this articleThe UK is notoriously bad at controlling air pollution, with 37 cities persistently displaying illegal levels and the Government repeatedly being hauled into court over the past few years.Simon Alcock, of environmental law firm ClientEarth, said: \u0027Air pollution is damaging our health from the womb to old age. It is unacceptable in 2018 for people to be risking dementia just by breathing. We need big, bold action from the Government to clean up the air and protect our health.\u0027The microscopic particles in air pollution are breathed deep into the lungs and enter the blood stream. Scientists believe they then travel into the brain where they provoke inflammation – a problem which may trigger dementia.          Several car giants including BMW, Mercedes and VW among others are being investigated over the emissions technologyThe commission said it would examine whether the group agreed to avoid competing against each other in the race to install \u0027clean emission devices\u0027 in diesel and petrol cars sold throughout Europe.Emissions-cutting devices are expensive and push up the cost of building cars, meaning there would have been a financial incentive for manufacturers to drag their heels.The European commission said if car makers did conspire with each other, this would amount to a breach of the EU\u0027s anti-trust rules which outlaw cartels.Commissioner Margrethe Vestager added: \u0027If proven, this collusion may have denied consumers the opportunity to buy less polluting cars, despite the technology being available to the manufacturers.\u0027VW, Daimler and BMW said they would continue to co-operate with the commission\u0027s investigation but could not comment on the ongoing case.                                                    \u0027Greater investment is also needed in alternatives to motor vehicles, such as safer cycling infrastructure, and affordable and convenient public transport.\u0027But Dr James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer\u0027s Society, pointed out that the research had looked only at the chance of developing dementia, and had not actually proved that the pollution had caused the illness. \u0027There is evidence that exposure to air pollution can cause small particles to enter the brain, but it\u0027s a huge leap to say that air pollution could lead to dementia and this study had several limitations,\u0027 he said.A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u0027Air pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and while air quality has improved significantly since 2010, we recognise there is more to do.\u0027This is why we have put in place a £3.5 billion plan to reduce harmful emissions from road transport and have launched an ambitious Clean Air Strategy which has been commended by the World Health Organisation.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/16/4F974A7800000578-0-image-m-24_1535814600374.jpg","title":"100m backlash begins against Unilevers bid close UK HQ","story":"Unilever´s offices on Victoria Embankment in London It was also feared the move could land British investors with a £100million foreign tax grab.Last night NFU Mutual became the first minor shareholder to break cover and oppose the proposal.Unilever – the maker of household favourites like Marmite and Persil – wants to sever its links to Britain which have endured since Victorian times.The change needs the backing of 75 per cent of investors who own shares through the London Stock Exchange at a crunch vote next month.M\u0026ampG – which looks after £285.8billion of savers\u0027 cash and sponsors the Chelsea Flower Show – hit out at Unilever\u0027s failure to consult shareholders. Head of corporate finance, Rupert Krefting, said: \u0027We do not support Unilever\u0027s proposal to redomicile to the Netherlands as the company has not adequately persuaded UK shareholders.\u0027The traditional cuppa is going down the drain!

Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority.          Mrs May (pictured leaving Downing Street today) called on associations to build more high-quality social housing and urge them to help change attitudes\u0027On the outside, many people in society – including too many politicians – continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home.\u0027We should never see social housing as something that need simply be \u0027good enough\u0027, nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better.\u0027Whether it is owned and managed by local authorities, tenant management organisations or housing associations, I want to see social housing that is so good people are proud to call it their home … our friends and neighbours who live in social housing are not second-rate citizens.\u0027The new money – which will become available in 2022 – is an attempt to send a signal to housing associations that they can build homes with the confidence Government funding will continue in the long term. As well as encouraging home ownership, Mrs May said she wants to ensure those who cannot afford to buy have somewhere they are proud to live.Housing associations should \u0027lead major developments\u0027 instead of just taking a share of private sector projects, she argued.Mrs Thatcher\u0027s right-to-buy allowed hundreds of thousands of council house tenants to buy their homes at a discount.

Unilever announced this week it was planning on ditching its UK-based HQ in favour of RotterdamIf Unilever shifts its domicile to the Netherlands, its shares will no longer qualify for the FTSE 100 Index in London.Institutional investors feel they are, in effect, being asked by Polman to collude in a Dutch takeover of Unilever.This may ultimately depress the value of their shares as FTSE 100 tracker funds are compelled to sell their holdings. Understandably, many — including some of our biggest companies — are making their anger felt.Over the years, Unilever has built up a wonderful track record of never cutting its idends, which has made it an ideal investment for retirement. The company may not have offered exciting immediate yields or high instant returns, but it was hard to beat over the longer-term.ROBERT HARDMAN: Port Sunlight’s visionary founder will be...£100m backlash begins against Unilever’s bid to close UK HQ:...Unilever boss claims to be Geordie – but is more Sting than...Share this articleThat is what made Unilever beloved of stockbrokers and fund-holders. Now, all that is at risk.Polman, set to retire next year, says he wants to simplify the firm\u0027s structures with one corporate HQ (currently there are two, in London and Rotterdam), reducing bureaucracy and duplication.In theory, I agree. Having more than one HQ dissipates a unifying sense of purpose and means executives waste far too much time shuttling between organisations.But why on earth has he chosen the Netherlands rather than Britain?This country should have been the obvious choice. Apart from its history here, 60 per cent of Unilever\u0027s sales originate from the UK, while English, the global language of commerce, gives us a huge competitive advantage, especially in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America, where Unilever household and beauty products are becoming popular.The pro-EU brigade will insist that Polman\u0027s choice was driven by Brexit. According to their narrative, the Leave vote has left Britain hopelessly cut off from Europe, so more moves like Unilever\u0027s are inevitable. But this is a warped analysis based on politicised wishful thinking.The probable reason lies in the chief executive\u0027s instinctive preference, as a Dutchman, for his homeland over Britain and for the Dutch model of capitalism.It provides greater protection against predatory bids by foreign firms, and after a brutal takeover attempt of Unilever by global giant Kraft Heinz last year, Polman has good cause to be wary of similar initiatives that the more open market in Britain encourages.But he will also have been heavily influenced by the Dutch government\u0027s recent decision to agree in principle a more welcoming tax environment for corporations, particularly through a reduction in the taxation of shareholders\u0027 idends.In fact, the Dutch tax changes planned for 2020 — bringing the country\u0027s tax structure into line with that of other more tax-friendly countries, including Britain — were specifically intended to lure companies like Unilever.          Brexit has cast doubt onto several firms\u0027 headquarters in the UK - sparking fears they could move to EU countriesCompetitiveIt may not be a coincidence that Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands who initiated the changes, was a manager at Unilever before he entered politics.Ministers here should take note: Britain may be losing one of its great companies because a Continental neighbour has adopted a more competitive corporate tax regime.So how should we respond? How can we make Britain the place where the world comes to do business, while protecting our corporate heritage?We know that corporate taxes and red tape shackle enterprise. And to be fair, this Government has taken some steps in this direction by lowering corporation tax to a record low of 19 per cent.Contrary to the warnings of the doom-mongers who wailed about \u0027giveaways to the super-rich\u0027, these tax reductions actually increased Treasury revenues, with corporation tax take rising from £44 billion to £58 billion over the past three years.That\u0027s all well and good. But to unleash commercial dynamism fully, I believe the Government should abolish corporation tax altogether. Employment and investment would soar and, instead of seeing companies making plans to leave Britain, I have no doubt that they would come flocking.The knock-on effect, of course, would be that the accompanying explosion in wealth and job creation would generate increased revenues for the Government.ProsperityWe are living in a much more fluid, globalised world. Capital can be transferred across the globe at a click of a mouse. Governments have to adopt radical new thinking if they want businesses to stay and flourish.Whatever you think of Brexit, the fact is we are leaving the EU, so surely we should be pulling together to make a success of it.I believe that Brexit offers a golden opportunity for a major reset on our national approach to taxation and enterprise. It is through the embrace of the global free market that real prosperity lies — if only Westminster and Whitehall would seize the moment.Sadly, I fear it may come too late to save Unilever for Britain. The shareholders\u0027 meeting is next month and, despite the signs of revolt, the board will be determined to ram through the Chairman\u0027s flawed plan.Ironically enough, my own company might nominally benefit, for if Unilever goes, we will move up one place in the FTSE 100 Index pecking order. But really I want Unilever to remain where it was born.Leaving the EU should give us new opportunities to export and trade with the world, but we will only succeed if we are fit, ready and business-friendly.That\u0027s why the Government should be working night and day to encourage and empower the thousands of businesses which will drive Britain forward in the years to come.  £100m backlash begins against Unilever\u0027s bid to close UK HQ: Crisis as investors launch bid to stop Marmite-maker relocating to NetherlandsUnilever\u0027s bid to ditch its UK headquarters faced a full-blown crisis last nightM\u0026ampG Investments said it will oppose the firm\u0027s proposal for a single legal base in the NetherlandsThree of Aviva\u0027s investors have already warned against the change                                                                        ByJames Burton Chief City Correspondent For The Daily MailUnilever\u0027s bid to ditch its UK headquarters faced a full-blown crisis last night.Savings giant M\u0026ampG Investments said it will oppose the firm\u0027s proposal for a single legal base in the Netherlands.Aviva Investors, Columbia Threadneedle and Lindsell Train – Unilever\u0027s third largest shareholder in London – have already warned against the change.

Unilever claims to have found a way that would allow British investors to carry on getting payouts without paying the tax.But investors fear the Dutch authorities could close the loophole.

It was the brainchild of scientist and inventor Edwin Land and his Harvard tutor George Wheelwright and at first made the plastic for polarising sunglasses. In time, it was to create and popularise instant photography, launching a seriesof pioneering cameras and film formats. These inspired generations of artists, including Andy Warhol, Helmut Newton, Robert Mapplethorpe, Maripol, Keith Haring and Guy Bourdin. They helped to raise Polaroid to the status of cultural icon.This month, Polaroid Originals, launched the OneStep+ instant analogue camera which brings analogue instant photography up to date, as it can be connected to a smartphone app, enabling a range of effects.In 1943, Land’s three-year-old daughter asked her father why she couldn’t immediately see the photograph he had just taken of her. His first instant camera went on sale for $89.95 in 1948, and became the the template for Polaroid cameras for the next 15 years.Throughout the 50s, the Polaroid empire grew, with products distributed to more than 45 countries. The Polaroid SX-70 camera – the first camera to produce self-developing, colour instant photos – was launched in 1972. Edwin Land also appeared on the cover of Life magazine with his “magic camera”. But, with the swift rise of digital technology eclipsing instant photography by the 2000s, in 2008 Polaroid announced that it was stopping making instant film.After the company’s announcement, a group of enthusiasts stepped in, calling themselves the Impossible Project, to buy the world’s last remaining Polaroid film factory, at Enschede in the Netherlands.Polaroid’s production chain had been abandoned before the Impossible team bought the factory later in 2008. There were no negatives, no dyes and no suppliers to hand. They had to start from scratch, and reinvent the lost recipes for Polaroid film. The company rebranded itself last year as Polaroid Originals after acquiring Polaroid’s brand and intellectual property, and is the only company in the world making film for Polaroid cameras.In its heyday, when Polaroid was producing 5,000 cameras a day, the Enschede factory produced more than 50m film packs per year and employed many people in the city of Enschede. Several employees who started at the plant in the 1970s still work there. Andrew Billen, head of global manufacturing at Polaroid Originals, explains some of the key processes in producing Polaroid film.First, the foil that will carry the developing fluid is prepared. A red dye is applied, which is a kind of semi-permanent adhesive. This allows the paste to remain protected from the air, but will ensure that the pod ruptures correctly when the film is ejecting from the camera, thereby setting off the development process.  Then the  foil is slit into the exact width needed to make sachet of chemical developing paste called a “pod”.Depending on the type of negative, a recipe of chemicals is weighed out and placed in a large mixing vessel. It is then heated and blended. The paste is then pumped out into smaller drums ready for the next stage.The foil is run through a machine where a very small, exact quantity of the developing paste is added then heat sealed into the pod. Pods are loaded into metal trays, which are then transported to the film assembly machines to eventually be laminated to each inidual photo frame.Rolls of negative are fed through machines with very sharp circular knives, cut to size and then wound on to cardboard cores ready to be loaded into the film assembly machines.Negative materials are light sensitive, so they need to be cut in complete darkness. A special machine is required and its operators wear night-vision googles. Non-light-sensitive materials  are cut on a similar machine in the lightTo make the film cassettes,  black plastic granules are fed into an injection moulding machine, heated until they melt, then injected into a mould cavity. The plastic is then quickly cooled and the  cassette is ejected on to a conveyor. Cassettes are then transported to the film assembly machines.In the final stage, the  border mask and sheet are fed into the assembly machine. Here, in darkness, they are joined to the light-sensitive negative.After going through a series of cutting, folding and laminating processes, a developer pod is fixed to each frame. A stack of eight finished frames is then inserted into a plastic cassette together with a metal spring and (sometimes) a battery. A card known as a “dark slide” is then added to the top of the packs to prevent light corrupting the negative, then the finished plastic cassette is welded shut. The finished pack is inserted into a foil pouch which goes into a cardboard box.The machines – installed in the 1970s – are completely analogue. Operating and maintaining them requires a great deal of skill and take years to learn. Operators will occasionally need to enter the machine and work for short periods of time in complete darkness. They do this without night-vision googles,  completely by feel.The factory also purchases vintage Polaroid cameras from all over the world. These are cleaned, repaired and tested. Many date from the 1970s, and spare parts have to come from donor cameras as new spares are not available.In the 80s, built-in flash and point-and-shoot capability quickly became one of the most iconic and recognisable Polaroid features. These developments were followed by the introduction of wide-format film for use in professional settings such as medical examinations and police investigations. The 80s also brought a surge of influential users into the world of Polaroid, with artists and photographers such as Mary Ellen Mark, David Hockney, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Sarah Moon. More recently, artists including Ryan McGinley and Nobuyoshi Araki have continued to be inspired by the Polaroid creative tradition.The 80th anniversary of Edwin Land’s original Polaroid company was on 13 September 2017. The date also marked the renaming of the Impossible Project as Polaroid Originals. The Polaroid Originals OneStep+ camera, launched this month by Polaroid Originals, connects smartphones via bluetooth to an app to access creative tools such as double exposure, light-painting features, plus remote trigger and manual modes.

The ship was later used by the British royal navy in the American war of independence and was eventually scuttled with a dozen other vessels off Newport, Rhode Island in 1778.Kathy Abbass, the director of the project, reportedly told Fairfax that “we can say we think we know which one it is”.The director of the Australian National Maritime Museum, Kevin Sumption, confirmed to the  that a “promising site” had been located, though he said it had yet to be confirmed as the final resting place of the Endeavour.He said ers in the US were currently working to confirm whether one of five shipwrecks is the Endeavour by gathering samples from the location.Cook departed Plymouth in August 1768, and in April 1770 the Endeavour became the first European ship to reach the east coast of Australia when Cook arrived at what is now known as Botany Bay.The ship was renamed the Lord Sandwich 2 and in its later life was used by the British as a prison for Americans captured during the war of independence.It was scuttled in 1778 along with 12 other ships to act as a blockade in the lead up to the battle of Rhode Island.Sumption said ers believed the wreck may be the missing Endeavour because of the dimensions of the timber samples found at the bottom of the harbour.If the timber samples turned out to be British in origin, the researchers would seek approval from local authorities in the US to dig around the wreckage to seek further evidence.The search for the Endeavour is a joint project between RIMAP and the Australian National Maritime Museum. On its website Rimap published a statement saying they had “identified a possible site in Newport Harbour that might be the Lord Sandwich ex Endeavour” but that it required “detailed work … to prove it”.The Rhode Island state government also claimed official ownership of the fleet of shipwrecks in 1999, and while Sumption said it would be “hugely significant” to find the Endeavour, it would be “very, very unlikely” the wreck would be in a condition to travel to Australia.“What we can see on the seabed in Rhode Island is that all the 13 wrecks look somewhat similar, they really are a jumbled collection of timbers and stone ballast,” he said.“It’s very unlikely that significant parts of the vessel are intact, so the chances are that all you really have are samples of timber and if we’re very lucky maybe materials which relate to its last use as a prison ship.”The Australia National Museum is planning an exhibition to mark the 250th anniversary of Cook’s arrival in Australia in 2020.Ian Coates, the director of the exhibition, said it was an “amazingly timely discovery”.“We have a tendency to think the story stops when the Endeavour leaves Australian waters, but to think about what it did back in England in 1771 and on to the east coast of the US, it’s fascinating.”He said he held out hope some part of the wreckage could make it to Australian shores again.“In a museum you’re aware of the power of objects to take people back to the moment when these things are used or created,” he said. “To have something like the Endeavour as part of the story of the Cook voyage would be amazing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/082c227be9863cf527932765c1436100d6d0571a/94_0_4491_2694/master/4491.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ded131ea0a3b4b1a1f6db4f690563a8","title":"only 20 of rich britons hold ethical assets study finds","story":"UBS says Britons were second-least likely to buy into sustainable investments after AmericansOnly one in every five of the UK’s super-rich have even a tiny fraction of their assets held in sustainable investments, according to research which reveals that wealthy Britons are lagging behind Chinese and Brazilian millionaires in investing their money ethically.Among 5,300 HNIs surveyed, Britons were the second-least likely to invest in sustainable investments after Americans.Nick Tucker, head of the UK for UBS Global Wealth Management, said: “It is disappointing to see the UK lagging behind other markets in the pursuit of sustainable investments. However, the growing momentum among UK investors considering this investment route is undeniable. We are increasingly having conversations with clients, across generations, about how they can best build sustainable investing into their portfolios.“We’re now at a pivotal moment where increasing investor interest in sustainable investing and an increasing number of available and suitable products are coming together. We expect the UK market to play catch up as this plays out.”UBS said younger rich people are much more likely to pump their money into sustainable investments than their parents.

Workers’ pay rises are gradually increasing, although they remain perilously close to inflation.Inflation is when prices rise. Deflation is the opposite – price decreases over time – but inflation is far more common.A relatively new phenomenon, inflation has become a real worry for governments since the 1960s.As a rule of thumb, times of high inflation are good for borrowers and bad for investors.On the other hand, pensioners, who depend on a fixed income, watch the value of their assets erode.The government\u0027s preferred measure of inflation, and the one the Bank of England takes into account when setting interest rates, is the consumer price index (CPI).The retail prices index (RPI)\u0026nbspis often used in wage negotiations.Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, said: “A faster rate of inflation is likely to reduce the narrow gap between wages and inflation further, meaning that the rise in living standards for workers is likely to have been only marginal.”Some economist said the latest uptick for inflation could be temporary. Inflation has steadily declined this year as the impact from the post-EU referendum fall in sterling begins to fade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b07e1a47b2e1deb73adb687758247343e7553b2f/0_5_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=833e08d8bcbd14398e7c51cb1f8a28d1","title":"what would a truly walkable city look like","story":"The obsession with self-driving cars and dockless cycles means pedestrians are often overlooked. But if we fail to accommodate those on foot, we ignore an essential part of what makes a city greatArriving by Greyhound coach in Phoenix, Arizona, one November evening I was faced with either six hours waiting in the terminal or a one-mile walk with my wheelie suitcase to a nearby shuttle bus. I soon learned that simple-sounding walk was alongside a fast, unlit road with no pavement. Forced to take a taxi ($15 minimum fare) the Cameroonian driver and I talked incredulously as we watched the gravel and grass verge – perfectly wide enough for a sidewalk – drift past into the night.The modern obsession with autonomous and electric vehicles, dockless scooters and bicycles means it is easy to forget the humble pedestrian. However, as almost every journey starts or finishes on foot, we are ignoring a fundamental part of what makes a city great.As cities around the world close central streets to cars to mark World Car-Free Day,  Cities is looking at the joys and trials of urban walking.The US humourist and writer David Sedaris tells us about walking in cities from Raleigh to Reykjavik. Will Self explains what he learns from perambulations in London, there’s Fran Lebowitz in New York, Helen Garner in Melbourne, “natural navigator” Tristan Gooley in Portsmouth, and writers on Delhi and Newcastle, Cairo and Wellington.Laura Laker casts a critical eye on the performance of Vision Zero, the global city scheme to eliminate traffic deaths. London has signed up – will it enjoy the success of New York, or the delays of LA? The recent blocking of Sadiq Khan’s plans to pedestrianise Oxford Street does not bode well.Correspondent Stephen Burgen samples the newfound silence in the Spanish car-free city of Pontevedra, and Matthew Keegan discovers what prompted Hong Kong to reopen a popular pedestrian street to vehicles.Renate van der Zee looks at the rise, fall and rebirth of the Lijnbaan in Rotterdam – Europe’s first pedestrianised street – while Rachel Aldred at the University of Westminster crunches the numbers to identify the most dangerous London boroughs for people on foot.Oliver Wainwright explores the City of London’s forgotten Pedways – and asks whether these 1960s walkways can make a comeback.We consider the phenomenon of “desire lines”, examine the art of following a stranger in the hope of seeing a city in a new light, and much more.Susan Claris, associate director of transport consulting at the design and planning company Arup, says much can be done quickly and simply. “That for me is the joy of walkability,” she says. “There are so many things that can be done … it just takes someone to get on and do it.”The UK walking charity Living Streets says because such details have so long been neglected, cities with ambitions for pedestrians should appoint a walking champion, alongside tougher moves to tackle air pollution and reduce motor traffic volumes and the biggest road safety risk factor: speed. They say low emissions charging zones or smart road pricing, along with enforcement of 20mph speed limits, could help fund people-friendly city centres and safe routes to schools.Skye Duncan of the National Association of City Transportation Officials (Nacto), an association of 62 major North American cities and 10 transport agencies, says cities have long been asking the wrong question – how can we move cars? – when they should be asking: how can we move people?“Pedestrians haven’t been put at the heart of cities,” she adds. “Fundamentally it’s pretty difficult to make a great city without great walking conditions.”Notoriously car-centric Auckland in New Zealand recently published a report showing pedestrians as the most economically important transport mode in the city. They estimated that policies which put people off walking on Queen Street, a major shopping area, cost NZ$11.7m (£5.9m) a year.Shared areas were created in and around Fort Street, a mixed commercial and residential area in the central business district. The city replaced car parking on some streets with trees and outdoor seating, and removed bollards and kerbs that had separated cars from pedestrians. The moves created more space for open-air activities, and made clear accessible routes for the visually impaired.Bruno Royce, who conducted a safety review of the scheme, says shared spaces aren’t suitable everywhere, but can be a useful first step towards full pedestrianisation. Despite the changes he says some cars still travelled above 22kph, higher than the 10kph ideal. He would like to see the city narrowing or “kinking” the shared space to slow cars, or ban cars completely for part of the day.The City of London Corporation recently banned all but buses, bicycles and pedestrians on weekdays from its notorious dangerous Bank junction (pictured above) – the site of 107 casualties including two deaths between 2012 and 2016.On nearby Queen Street it is looking to reduce conflict between people on bikes and on foot in a busy shared space. Almere Technology is tracking and analysing interactions using cameras and machine learning software.“What we are trying to do is stop the awkward dance,” says Almere Technology’s Tom Bailey, describing the point at which a pedestrian and cyclist interact, and one or both move aside.“At less than three-quarters of a metre from pedestrians, generally the perception of conflict increases. The classic complaint is ‘these cyclists are travelling too fast’ but what does too fast mean in that context?”Against baseline data the will trial different interventions, from “slow down” signs to separate bike lanes. Surveys of pedestrians and cyclists will help determine which works best.Action Aid, Plan International and UN Women are developing pilot locations in cities across the country to test different interventions, such as street lighting.Action Aid launched an app called S-City for people to report how safe or unsafe they feel on the street, in the workplace, or in schools, buses or public toilets. A map of the crowdsourced safety data helps others choose the safest route. The data will also be used to monitor how cities are performing and call for improvements. A useable network of high-quality paths is key for a pedestrian-friendly city. Greater Manchester has recently announced a 1,000-mile £160m walking and cycling grid, including 1,400 safer road crossings, improved footways and 25 “filtered neighbourhoods” which prioritise people on bike and on foot over cars, and featuring places to sit, play and socialise. When completed, Beelines will be the UK’s biggest connected walking and cycling network.Work will be overseen by Greater Manchester’s walking and cycling commissioner, the former Olympic gold medal cyclist Chris Boardman, in collaboration with the city’s 10 local authorities. Boardman wants the network to work for people of all ages, and talks about a “double buggy test” for pavement widths, and avoiding shared pavements with cycles.When people move to Denver, Colorado, from places like New York, “they’re, like, ‘What’s wrong with the sidewalks? Why is it so hard to walk here?’,” says Jill Locantore.She is a campaigner for Walk Denver, a small team which runs anything from pop-up seating areas and traffic calming to pedestrian way-pointing signs.The city allocated $30m to improve sidewalks – although an estimated $1bn is needed. “At the current funding rate it would take 440 years to complete all the sidewalks in Denver,” says Locantore.Denver residents are responsible for maintaining sidewalks outside their homes, but a new funding programme could help out.Locantore would also like to see more trees, lighting, slower traffic and safety improvements to the most dangerous streets. A prime candidate is Federal Boulevard, the site of half of Denver’s 14 pedestrian deaths last year.A safe intersections programme aims to halve Addis Ababa traffic injuries and fatalities by 2023. Sebategna intersection, beside Africa’s largest market, Mercato, was transformed late last year with planters and floor paint, on a six-month trial basis – the picture above shows it before and after changes were made. Ten city junctions will be similarly transformed annually, for the next three years.An earlier transformation of LeGare intersection successfully reduced vehicle turning speeds from 30kph to 18.5kph. Broad central pedestrian refuges and pavements reduced crossing distances from 50m to as little as 6.5m. The result: people felt safer, and more of them used the improved crossings. An underpass would have cost 500-time more, Nacto estimates.Chris Duderstadt has placed 115 public benches around San Francisco since the he started his project in the 1970s. He hand-builds, paints and delivers the benches for free or a small donation, giving the community somewhere to meet and rest. He even shares his design so others can do the same.“They make a neighbourhood much friendlier,” he says. “With an hour and a half I can make a bench. It gives me joy, it gives other people joy.”If the proposed location is suitable, Duderstadt paints them to fit in – he painted an “emmental yellow” bench outside a cheese shop – or tailors them according to requests from hosts who “adopt” them.The benches sometimes attract homeless people, and criticism. If that happens Duderstadt says he or the hosts will help rough sleepers get in touch with local services, and will remove the bench for a period.“I’ve had a bench in front of my house for 40 years and, generally speaking, people that sit on the bench are respectful,” he says. “It builds communities. Sometimes the people who use them don’t smell good, but that’s life.”We’re eager to hear your thoughts and experiences of walking in cities.

Climb every mountain and agreement is somewhere up there, will be the reassuring message from her ”few minutes over dinner” address to the 27 EU leaders. Only when – or if – she survives contact with her party will they put her impossible demands through the wringer.Every path looks blocked, every likely or unlikely deal set to be voted down in parliament. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, says Labour will vote down any deal that crosses its six red lines. Remember those were all drawn from promises the Brexiteers made in the referendum campaign. That includes their pledge to keep the “exact same benefits” of the single market and customs union. If that’s impossible, so were all the fantasies sold to voters.Labour, gathering in Liverpool this weekend, faces its own great conundrums. Here’s its choice: it could emerge as the one party that can rescue the country from the morass the Tories have plunged us into, the one clear route out of both Brexit and austerity. Or it could descend into a hornets’ nest of internal strife incomprehensible to voters it needs to win over. A party at war over changing the rules to make every MP face an open contest at every election, obliging obedience to their local party, is a terrible look. It’s a rum democracy that refuses to propose US-style open primaries where local voters choose their candidate – the way the excellent Sarah Wollaston was selected in Totnes. Cracks run through the party, with new splits among Momentum people, and between Momentum and the unions, over new rules for selecting the leader.Nor is there unity among non-Corbynites, ranging from a tiny handful who might split, to a large soft-left of many hues who only coalesce when respected MPs come under assault from the hard left. Chris Williamson, witch-finder general, stirring up enmity in his threatening “roadshow” tour of seats of MPs he thinks insufficiently loyal to the leader, may not be organised by the leadership, but he could have been stopped. It did step in when Canterbury’s Rosie Duffield risked a no-confidence vote for attending an antisemitism rally: outrage at threats to a very popular victor of an unexpected seat saw them shut down within hours. But she was left shattered, considering her future in politics – as are many others, distraught at the bile flowing through their party.In his speech, let’s hear Jeremy Corbyn say something like this: “I will stand for no more vendettas against those who didn’t choose me as leader. Anyone using #JC4PM to abuse other Labour people, you don’t do that in my name. We are always a broad church – I know it better than anyone – and as a broad church, not as narrow sectarians, we will win.” That would be wise peacemaking, when any anti-Corbynites mad enough to split may vanish into the wilderness, but could still prevent a Labour victory.Here’s the question for Corbyn: after a disastrous summer of feuding over antisemitism, will Labour spend the week on display as a nasty party energised by who controls its own meaningless citadels of power – or a serious party heading for real power?Internal ructions are of Labour’s own devising, but it was never Labour’s fault that Brexit was destined to cause it agonies: how does it please its voters in Hampstead and Hull? Finally, a path through is emerging. As Brexit destroys the Tories – every deal, let alone no deal, looking worse than the next – this is Labour’s moment to step up as national saviour.More motions calling for a people’s vote have been put to the conference than for any other issue, mostly from Momentum-backed constituencies. The leadership clings to the formula that when all Brexit options fail in parliament, Labour wants an election. Well, of course it does, but even if the Tories are crazy, the one thing they won’t do is gift an election to Labour. So far, Labour and the unions have put the people’s vote “on the table”. The conference has this chance to turn it into Labour’s first option.Nervous Labour shadow cabinet members tell me the time isn’t right. Although 100 constituencies have swung from Brexit to remain, the polls are still not flowing fast enough. What if they declare for a democratic vote, and there is an election? A new Labour government would be forced into a deeply unwanted referendum. But there won’t be an election. Better by far to lead the upsurge of support for a popular vote that is coming from left and right of the party. The Tories have made such a mess of Brexit that “let the people decide” should be an easy message.To all who say it’s an undemocratic rerun, here are some good analogies. If a trade union leader calls a ballot and members vote to strike, when he negotiates with the bosses he brings them back a possible deal: he doesn’t impose it, but puts it back to the vote. A GP says you need an operation and sends you to a consultant, who, being more expert, gives you odds of success and reckons it will do more harm than good: you would change your mind, wouldn’t you? If you agree to buy a house, before you complete you have it surveyed. If the surveyor finds foundations sinking, dry rot in the attic and dodgy title deeds, you change your mind. Well, the Brexit surveys are in and each looks grimmer than the last.Let’s play optimistic politics. Corbyn should say: “We gave them every chance to produce the Brexit they promised. The endgame is here, but their Brexit promises have vanished. Now only a people’s vote can restore public trust – and only Labour can protect the country against Brexit damage.” That’s the victory path. Can he do that?For any delegates at the conference tempted by factional warfare, just keep focused on the prospect of a second decade of Torydom. Sajid Javid – regarded as a “moderate” – regaled the last cabinet meeting with a 10-minute leadership pitch worthy of his Ayn Rand spirit-guide. He called for “shock-and-awe” tax cuts for business, deregulation of workers’ rights, abolishing automatic enrolment in pension schemes and scrapping environment controls.That should knock sense into any Labour sectarians. So too should the success John McDonnell has had in recent weeks laying out policies and principles with the vigour of a man who seriously wants to win. Good to see him espouse the long-needed Robin Hood tax, which Britain has blocked the EU from imposing on financial transactions. He is making surprising friends: Lord O’Neill (ex-Goldman Sachs chief economist) told the Sunday Times: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government. They have captured the mood of the times.” The goal is wide open – if Labour avoids being its own worst enemy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a4f83cd51f62869945ce783cda4c9b5a2e0333b/8_16_2040_1224/master/2040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4d6c40714e132cc8ca954e334d22650","title":"rspca seal charity fish farms seals","story":"The animal charity’s certification of fish farms knowing that they shoot ‘pests’ indicates a tragic descent into hypocrisyAs the drive for growth and profit intrudes into all relationships, it captures even the bodies that exist to hold capital to account. Agencies of the state, newspapers and broadcasters, campaign groups and charities that claim to restrain corporate power fall under its spell. As their mission becomes confused and their purpose dissipates, substance is replaced with spectacle.Last week, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) issued a press release about the “incredible story” of Marina, a seal it rescued, that had become trapped under a rock on a beach in south Wales. “Moving a three-tonne boulder presents numerous challenges, but we were able to work with partners to free this seal, before giving her the six months of rehabilitation she so urgently needed.” Marina’s rescue is “testimony to the RSPCA’s tireless commitment to wild animals, and their welfare”.On the same day, the RSPCA’s head of campaigns, pushed into a corner during an online argument, wrote this: “Seal shooting is not culling it’s about humane pest control.” He was defending the slaughter of seals by Scottish salmon farms.The RSPCA won’t publish a list of the farms it has approved, citing a “contractual clause in the membership agreement”. But of the 24 people who sit on the advisory group for its assurance scheme (according to the most recent published list), 20 work for salmon farming companies. These companies include the four named in an investigation into seal shooting in 2013, by the Global Alliance Against Industrial Aquaculture,\u0026nbspas\u0026nbsp“the\u0026nbspworst\u0026nbspoffenders”.There is no closed season for shooting seals. When lactating mothers are shot, their orphaned pups starve to death on remote beaches. The RSPCA does not deny that farms it certifies shoot seals. It tells me it is urgently trying to bring the practice to an end. I might have found this more convincing if it hadn’t said the same thing in 2008. It also maintains that shooting seals is “a last resort”. But the majority of Scottish salmon farms fail to double-net their cages to exclude seals. This is more expensive than bullets, but you might have hoped it would be the minimum requirement for an RSPCA Assured farm.The RSPCA tells me that “double netting is not suitable for all sites”, but is unable to tell me what proportion of the farms it certifies could use double netting. Where this method cannot be used, you might have hoped the society would say “that’s it: we will not certify salmon farming here”.It insists that farms that want its accreditation and that are at high risk of predation by seals must have “acoustic deterrent devices in place where appropriate”. These make a loud noise intended to scare seals away. Unfortunately, they also cause pain and distress to dolphins, porpoises and whales, disrupting their behaviour and driving them out of their feeding grounds. These are by no means the only problems caused by salmon farms.In the hope of controlling this infestation, some salmon farms dose their fish with organophosphate pesticides. These are likely to devastate crustacean populations in the sea lochs, and many other species that depend on them. Some of the companies providing the fish meal on which farmed salmon are fed trawl and grind up entire marine ecosystems, arguably causing greater environmental damage than any other fishing operation.The harder you look at this industry, the more obvious it becomes that it is inherently incompatible with either animal welfare or environmental protection. Yet the Scottish government, which sees salmon farming as a crucial growth industry, wants it to double by 2030. It seems to me that the RSPCA’s assurance provides the necessary fig leaf.The RSPCA insists that it is not motivated by the fees it receives for certifying salmon farms. These, it says, “are ploughed back into the scheme’s running costs”. I’m sure this is true. The problem, I feel, runs much deeper: to my eyes, its mission seems to have slipped from preventing cruelty to modifying industrial animal farming. If its objective is to prevent cruelty, surely it should instead endorse the rapid shift towards veganism?Marina is the spectacle – the actor in the spotlight – that helps to drive the RSPCA’s public image. The unapproved seals of Scotland and their orphaned pups, in the darkness behind the stage, are reduced to the status of pests. Debord defined the spectacle as “a negation of life that has invented a visual form for itself”. He was right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b04195cf94b285bee48f2de3926b124da15f20/0_481_7114_4267/master/7114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2475c79fad8ab4430442292b2f6539c","title":"nasser hussain in the nets how a local cricket club got a first class makeover","story":"When Ilford Cricket Club won a community cricket honour, its facilities were soon transformed – shortly followed by league success and coaching sessions from stars of the game. By Chas Newkey-Burden“Come on, keep those balls coming – otherwise we’re just people standing in a shed!”Nasser Hussain is not here to muck about. The former England captain is putting kids through their paces in the indoor nets of Ilford Cricket School. Famed in his pomp for a feisty batting style, he’s much the same as a teacher. Former England seamer, Sajid Mahmood, is in the adjoining net, teaching bowling.The kids can hardly believe their luck. They lap up the attention of both legends, grab selfies and get their bats signed. Proud parents film on their phones. Balls whizz through the air, and shrieks of excitement bounce off the walls. At the end of the class, a tiny youngster bowls out Hussain. The roof nearly lifts off the hall.Just an hour earlier, poor weather threatened to derail a much-anticipated day. ESPNcricinfo had been booked to give the full match day treatment to Ilford Cricket Club’s tie against rivals Ilford Town, courtesy of NatWest. Hussain and Mahmood were due to give a pre-match masterclass on the pitch.But after weeks of sunny, sweltering conditions, the day began with improbably grey skies, bucketing rain and heavy winds. As everyone sheltered in the clubhouse, the only sign of life outside was a cagouled woman, bravely walking her springer iel through the bluster.Then Hussain arrived, bouncing in with a chirpy: “Turned out nice again.” He was followed by the towering presence of Mahmood. As the energy began to shift, their masterclasses were moved indoors and a weather app suggested that a truncated match could be played in mid-afternoon. It was game on.Speaking after the classes, Hussain explained his pugnacious approach. “Look, cricket can be a dull game if you don’t get on with it,” he says. “I hate coaching sessions when all you hear is the coach – when you have an hour and the coach has spoken for 40 minutes and the kids are standing there bored.”In fact, the kids had been electrified and impressive in both the classes. Mahmood says: “I was really amazed by the number that turned out and the level of talent. Their technique was very, very good.” Hussain agreed, adding: “There’s a strong British-Asian community here and they pick up things very quickly because they follow the game so passionately.”Back at the clubhouse, Ilford chairman Maz Malik’s cheery energy was helping keep the day on track, despite the weather. “We’ve been having sub-continental conditions for six weeks, but today it’s back to the reality of English summer,” he laughed.A cricket fanatic – he says he’d get up to watch the Seychelles play the Bahamas at 3am – he has been part of the club since 1980, when he joined as a nine-year-old. As we speak, the razzmatazz of the day carries on around us: ESPN commentates on the match and NatWest’s virtual reality tent thrills kids. A barbecue sizzles away. Hussain, who cut his teeth here in the 1980s, and Mahmood chat with locals.“It’s been an exceptional day – we were very honoured to get selected,” says Malik. He describes the masterclasses as an “aspirational experience” for local kids. “It brings stars into reality. The kids see that these are human beings and that they can follow in their footsteps.”Gesturing to the NatWest “Cricket has no boundaries” banner, he talks about the “huge” changes he has seen in the sport. “Things have become less stuffy,” he says. “There has been less of the old boys’ network shirts, ties and collars. It’s become more accessible. We’re open for all – people of all abilities and backgrounds.”There are plans to host a “tape-ball” cricket tournament in August to attract those from south Asia and those who find the entry cost to full cricket prohibitive. The club has already subsidised some local youngsters who were referred by local authorities because of difficult circumstances.Members of the club, which was founded in 1879, say the atmosphere and relations across the board are much tighter since the involvement of CricketForce. Everyone has a new spring in their step. The first team recently topped the Essex Premier League for the first time in over 20 years. “I don’t see that as a coincidence,” says Malik.Captain Theeban Tavarasa, 31, has been involved with the club for 18 years, since his talent was spotted one day by Nasser Hussain’s father, Jawad, in the nets of Ilford Cricket School. “We are a very multicultural club, we have people from all walks of life: Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, English, Irish – we’ve got such a good society here,” says Tavarasa.“I believe this local community needs a cricket club like this. When you hear about so much crime and discord in London, a club like ours can help the community with cohesion. We can set a shining example.”Summing up the occasion, Sajid Mahmood strikes a similar note. “Today has brought the community together,” he says. “I think NatWest have done a fantastic job in supporting this. They’ve realised the contribution days like this can make towards community cohesion.”Mohammad Akhtar was the star on the day, with a pivotal 59 from 40 balls as Ilford CC (173 for 4) beat Ilford Town (170 for 8) by six wickets. Watching from the perimeter, Usman Ul Haq, a highly-tipped youngster who also plays for Essex, discusses the positive impact cricket has had on his life. “It helps you stay away from trouble and harmful paths,” says the 13-year-old, whose proud father Inam has been an Ilford member for more than 20 years.“Today has been amazing,” continues Usman with a smile. “How often do you have a first-class cricketer in your net giving you tips, then hanging around, signing your bats and then coming on to the club house to have a nice chat with you?“What I’ve learned more than anything today is that you don’t need to be good at the game to enjoy the game. This whole day has shown that you should play for the love of it. That’s the best way.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981. NatWest are the principal Proud Partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the Official Partners of Chance to Shine, reflecting the bank’s own values and commitment to fairness and inclusion.To find out more, visit NatWest Cricket"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aedcd79f7d5a72dacfe0fdd0d247fc6ddafb8010/73_34_4492_2695/master/4492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=639b4a559ea56d601c9383d3b421e6d3","title":"oxford spends 108000 to recruit each extra low income student","story":"New figures reveal scale of challenge as pupils from independent schools still dominate admissionsOxford University spends more than £100,000 for each additional student from a poor background it admits every year, according to a new analysis of its efforts to improve access.Figures published in Prospect show that Oxford’s “cost of acquisition” for every extra student from a low-income area admitted since 2009 is £108,000. The data is based on Oxford’s record of admitting about 10 extra students from low-income postcodes each year between 2009 and 2016, spending at least £14m a year on access and widening participation as required by higher education regulators.About 5,000 school-leavers in the two most disadvantaged postcode categories attain A-level grades that would qualify them for Oxbridge, but Oxford admitted only 220 such students in 2015-16.Writing in Prospect, Alan Rusbridger, the former  editor who is now principal of Lady Margaret Hall, lays bare the ongoing debate within Oxford over its admissions policies.The university faces ongoing criticism for its over-representation of students from private schools and wealthy families, as well as its uneven record in admitting UK students from black and other minority ethnic backgrounds.Not all the £14m-a-year figure goes on recruiting students, some is spent on bursaries for those who are already admitted. The £108,000 per extra student is calculated using the proportion spent on outreach activities and staff, and then iding it by the number of extra students recruited per year. “Twenty-three works out at less than one per college. To Oxford this is ‘challenging’,” Rusbridger says. In comparison, 38 pupils at St Paul’s, an independent boys school in London, received offers from Oxford last year.Ken MacDonald, the former director of public prosecutions who is warden of Wadham College, is quoted as supporting contextual admissions, which would vary entry requirements according to a student’s circumstances.“We have to recognise that people in failing schools with difficult socio-economic backgrounds who get themselves in a position to make a competitive application have achieved something extraordinary,” MacDonald said.“I mean, someone who’s got an A and two Bs from a crap comprehensive in Hull is quite capable of being as clever, if not cleverer, than someone who got three A*s at Westminster.”Part of the blame for the continued reliance on independent schools is competition caused by the university’s informal league table, known as the Norrington table, which ranks colleges by degree results.A new league table devised by Oxford’s student union ranks colleges by the proportion of pupils admitted from disadvantaged postcodes – and shows no conflict between ersity and academic performance. Traditional academic powerhouses such as Merton, St John’s and Balliol are in the top 10 for degree results and disadvantage.In an effort to speed up change, some college leaders and senior academics – including Prof Maggie Snowling, the president of St John’s College – are open to greater centralisation of admissions, which happens in Oxford’s medical school and in postgraduate admissions.But centralised admissions would threaten centuries of college autonomy and encounter stiff resistance. Prospect quotes one veteran college head as saying: “I have tried to propose a more centralised system and I have got no particular traction over several years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5db9e9d58a37bf63edc19131b6448def0e63bd43/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=940121460c23e3c23ebee3cec5e25da4","title":"chris packham launches peoples manifesto for wildlife","story":"Initiative lays out practical steps we can all take to help halt destruction of species and habitats in BritainReplanting hedgerows, including birdboxes on all new-build homes, rewilding uplands and an end to seal culling: these are among demands of the People’s Manifesto for Wildlife, a new initiative aimed at halting the drastic decline in British wildlife.The manifesto has been drawn up by the naturalist and broadcaster Chris Packham, with the aid of 17 independent experts and scientists. They warned that people are sleepwalking into an “ecological apocalypse”, but said everyone could take practical steps themselves, and campaign for broader measures that could yet avert the wholesale destruction of species and habitats.This Saturday, Packham is urging people from around the country to march through London to demonstrate their support for wildlife. He called on the government to bring forward a series of measures to halt destruction, but said people should also feel empowered to make their own changes.“This is a people’s manifesto, not devised by the government, and we don’t have to wait for them to do something,” he said. “We can do it ourselves. I want this manifesto to be a first draft to ignite public interest. We know how to solve the problems, we just need to make it happen.”Thousands of people are expected to turn out for the march, including Packham, columnist George Monbiot and nature writer Robert MacFarlane, while entertainment is to be provided by Billy Bragg, Grace Petrie and Saskia Eng. The walk, supported by many NGOs, schools and businesses, will start with people gathering in Hyde Park, central London, from 10am, with entertainment from noon to 1pm, followed by the walk which is expected to finish at 2pm.The drastic decline in British wildlife has accelerated in recent years, with main factors being the rise in intensive farming and the destruction of habitats. Farmland bird numbers have more than halved since 1970, while the disappearance of insects went largely unremarked for years.Some of the measures called for in the manifesto will require the cooperation of businesses and government: wildlife ponds for every industrial estate and all municipal parks, a pesticide tax, and an end to scallop dredging in UK waters.Others may be highly controversial: banning dogs, except for assistance dogs, from all nature reserves. These would be compensated for by new dogwalking hotspots, but the issue is still likely to raise hackles among some pet-owners.Among other ideas in the manifesto are ways to broaden participation in the conservation movement, for instance through promoting the importance of nature in schools and to young people to improve their mental health, and apprenticeship schemes to widen access to conservation jobs.Michael Gove, secretary of state for the environment, pledged to consider the report in depth. “Chris Packham and his colleagues have successfully motivated the public to get behind many of these issues,” he said. “Through our schools we can develop the next generation of environmentally aware citizens and ensure wildlife and the natural world is protected.”Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, which is assisting with the event, said: “Our natural environment isn’t just a nice-to-have – it is crucial for our food, health and wellbeing. It’s time to end the sustained assault on wildlife and put it firmly at the heart of government policy making where it belongs.”Tim Farron, environment spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, whose party conference finishes in Brighton on Wednesday, said: “Chris Packham is right children do need to have more of a connection with the outdoors, whether that’s tree planting in urban areas or farm visits in rural ones. If they get that when they’re young, they will want to protect our environment in the future. The planning system also needs to be improved to help wildlife thrive – houses and offices need to be built with the environment in mind. We need to demand better from this government, that when they finally start building more houses the environment is central to their thinking.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/504ad77b6ef41623fe8b9d91bc8838e13078c784/0_0_8031_4819/master/8031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c88fa77ba4ec25661f75ed8fdc399471","title":"tie dye fashion bieber","story":"Justin Bieber wears it to church, Lady Amelia Windsor recently wore a Michael Kors version, and at last week’s New York fashion week it was given the high-fashion nod by Calvin Klein. Proof, if proof were needed, of the broad appeal of tie-dye, which is having a moment of mainstream acceptability.Tie-dye has been on our radar for the last few seasons, largely because it has appeared as much on the catwalk as off it – one of the street-style highlights from this weekend’s London shows was an Ashley Williams green-and-yellow tie-dye hoodie that read: “Don’t know don’t care.”Its current popularity may be thanks to its versatility. Tony Glenville, creative director of the school of media and communication at London College of Fashion, describes it as “a great background to put logos over” that works “at a designer level and cheap”. Tie-dye pieces on the high street (see Asos T-shirts, Champion hoodies and Stussy shirts) are also tapping into the DIY aesthetic in an age in which authenticity is prized, regardless of whether it actually is authentic.Tie-dye was once authentic, says Alistair O’Neill, professor of fashion history and theory at Central Saint Martins. According to O’Neill, various guises of “resist-dying”, where materials and methods are used to prevent the dye from reaching all the cloth, have existed for centuries in countries such as Indonesia, Japan and India. Tie-dye as we know it was adopted in the US by hippies who were – according to O’Neill - interested in “using secondhand folk and tribal fabrics and bringing those into the mix to suggest an alternative anti-consumer form of dress”, and realised they could make their own DIY version. It was also a lot about psychedelic drugs and “the idea of acid visions and forms of visual transportation that mind-altering drugs can offer”.In the late 60s, tie-dye fell to commercialisation on the US east coast after an employee of the failing Rit Dye company persuaded his bosses to swap powder dyes for squeezable liquid versions – all the better for creating tie-dye with. The garments went on to be sold at Woodstock, a seminal moment marked by Janis Joplin on the stage in head-to-toe tie-dye.In 2018, though, it’s more about muted colours. At Ganni, tie-dye T-shirts the colour of butterscotch Angel Delight have a sophistication their psychedelic cousins could only dream of, while at Topshop, a Glamorous Bardot top gets the tie-dye tratment in muted sky-blue. As O’Neill says, “it doesn’t look particularly 1968” – though it might be a little easier to wear than that decade’s rainbow brights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8d4022d55b445abebbf1b7deba9893b70e25abf/934_1908_3098_1858/master/3098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daa16813b8862093abe9a785d768b620","title":"on the scent the best perfumes for autumnwinter 2018 in pictures","story":"Fancy smelling like oranges in the Basque sun?

That’s true for big-wave surfing, wingsuit flying, free-ing, extreme skiing and ultralight alpinism. Deadly pursuits all – pass the popcorn.Free Solo, a new film about rock climber Alex Honnold, is different. The movie tells the story of Honnold’s unprecedented ropeless ascent in June 2017 of El Capitan, the great granite cliff in Yosemite Valley, California. It’s a scary movie to watch – even if, according to Honnold, the climb was not scary at the time.“I think a big part of the film is showing the long process to get to that point where it wasn’t scary anymore,” said Honnold, 33, in a phone interview from a rooftop during the Toronto film festival, where it picked up the people’s choice award for best documentary. “Because I had been dreaming about soloing El Cap for so many years.”Most of the film plays out in the lead-up to the climb, during which Honnold (whom you might recognize from 60 Minutes he is the most accomplished “free solo” or ropeless rock climber in history) is seriously injured, twice, and the mojo gets wonky. Jimmy Chin, a co-director, tells Honnold that it’s OK if he does not want to go through with it.“Obviously I don’t want to hose everybody,” the climber replies.We know how the movie ends, because we read about it in the papers last year: Honnold summits, climbing from bottom to top in one perfect push, 3,000 feet in just under four hours, becoming the first person ever to climb the mountain that way, maybe the only person who will ever climb it that way.But as we watch the transcendent act unfold on-screen, that knowledge of how the movie ends feels about as useful as the unicorn suit that Honnold encounters en route (true story).In dozens of minutes of footage never before seen, Honnold climbs without a rope through awkward and difficult positions on minuscule holds in which one wrong move would mean death. Beyond each immediate physical challenge lies another, and then another, stacked to the sky. Meanwhile the trees below shrink to dots.“It’s so wild,” Honnold said on the phone, recalling a particular spot near the top. “And the footage is amazing, but I don’t know if it quite gives the full feel of a 2,500-foot drop on all sides around you. It’s nothing but air.”It seems at any moment – at every moment – that he must slip. The suspenseful climax of the film, a close-up view of Honnold unlocking a delicate granite puzzle at 2,000 feet, can best be described as precluding respiration. It’s hard to eat popcorn when you can’t exhale.“This climb is really about the process of moving through fear,” said co-director E Chai Vasarhelyi, whose works includes 2015’s Meru, which won an audience award at the Sundance film festival. “How methodical he is about it, how studied it is, and how we all could probably do that – hopefully it inspires people.”It’s a National Geographic documentary, and that film-making muscle flexes upon Honnold’s topout, with horns blaring and kettle drums booming as a helicopter-mounted camera zooms away from the cliff edge, leaving the climber behind in exchange for a gorgeous full-length view of the monolith. What was remarkable in the headlines is revolutionary on-screen – and the bigger the screen in this case, the better.“I’m so delighted,” Honnold says, sitting on the summit with a stupefied grin. “I’m so delighted. I’m so delighted.” Audiences will be, too.Hitting theaters almost simultaneously is another astounding documentary, The Dawn Wall, which follows Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson’s 2015 ascent of the route by that name, also on El Capitan. To have two feature-length climbing films land at once is a remarkable treat for the enthusiast, and a sign of boom times for the sport, which will make its Olympics debut in 2020.Jorgeson, a balletic boulderer whose struggle on the Dawn Wall supplies the film’s main suspense, came to the project after years of reconnaissance work by Caldwell. Once again, we know how it ends: with a happy topout, a media scrum and a Barack Obama thumbs up.But once again, in the moment, it looks grim. The pair are using safety ropes – everyone except Honnold uses ropes to climb El Capitan – but the physical difficulty of the route far exceeds the line Honnold took. Caldwell gets through the key challenge first and decides to suspend his ascent to wait for Jorgeson. In one of the film’s lighter moments – it has a more playful feel than Free Solo – the cameras roll as Caldwell, a climbing wizard but not a virtuoso communicator, fumblingly tells Jorgeson that he will stick with him for as long as it takes. There is no “I” in bro.“I didn’t want to put the pressure on him,” said Caldwell in an interview last week in Manhattan. “I felt like, ‘This is not how I want to end this thing’.”Has any film better captured life on the wall? Directors Josh Lowell and Peter Mortimer, with director of photography Brett Lowell, show Caldwell and Jorgeson on their floating ledges sleeping, cooking, getting battered by a storm, howling, pooping, and executing amazingly intricate skin care routines involving razor blades, neosporin and cloth tape. The climbing footage is primo, with miles of sunny granite, ninja lunges and swooping falls. The route is usually called the hardest big wall anywhere, and for the first time flatlanders get a glimpse of why, as Jorgeson conquers one section with the dexterity of a blackjack dealer and the strength of a cobalt magnet.“It felt amazing,” said Jorgeson of his breakthrough moment. “There’s just this feeling that your feet are creeping off your holds in all the previous attempts. But they just felt a little more solid that time. Just solid enough to make it work.”Caldwell has a central role in Free Solo, too, as Honnold’s training partner and a friend who harbors no illusions about the risks, at one point referring to Honnold as “most likely to die”. The truth of that assessment hits home with footage in Free Solo of Honnold’s original, abortive try at his ropeless ascent, which happened eight months before the successful effort.“This sucks,” he tells a cameraman who catches up with him on a ledge, still in the dark because he has started so early. “I don’t want to be here. I’m over it.” Back on the ground, Honnold walks over to Peter Croft, one of the few legendary ropeless climbers to make it to age 60.“Good for you,” Croft replies.“Yep. Nope. Too many folks about.”“You made the perfect decision.”“Now it all has to drag on longer. I just need it to end, you know.”“You never have to go for it.”At which Honnold walks away. He clearly felt that he did have to go for it, for reasons that Free Solo goes impressively far in exploring.“I don’t believe you guys actually can watch it,” film-maker and Honnold friend Mikey Schaefer says during the climb, turning his back to the cliff. It makes for a fantastic movie. But the kind of fantastic movie where it would be just fine not to have a sequel.“I’m done – this is it,” says Schaefer. “We don’t need to do this again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4212f70f6411f8e751bbf944cf456d2b375ef6fe/0_91_3296_1978/master/3296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b184f9c0a4581f859bb009792bcc816","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool stamina gameplan psg champions league","story":"With Roberto Firmino absent from the starting lineup, James Milner, Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold proved their worth against PSGIn the blink of a damaged eye Roberto Firmino brought Anfield the victory its team deserved and the finale an enthralling contest merited. He also reinforced Jürgen Klopp’s point about not wishing to swap Liverpool’s front three for those of Paris Saint-Germain.Liverpool made it six wins out of six games this season with a stoppage-time winner that epitomised why they held the edge over the French champions. It was converted owing to the outstanding quality of Firmino and created thanks to the relentless industry of James Milner who, even in the 92nd minute and despite the setback of conceding an 83rd-minute equaliser, harried Kylian Mbappé off the ball on the edge of the PSG penalty area to launch one last, telling attack.“Nobody is irreplaceable,” said Klopp of Firmino’s likely absence before the game. His players are doing their utmost to prove that theory. From Milner to Andy Robertson, Trent Alexander-Arnold to Georginio Wijnaldum, Liverpool possess players with both the quality and prodigious work rate to make Klopp’s demanding gameplans succeed. Thomas Tuchel has enviable inidual talent at his disposal but not the collective industry or cohesive unit to realise the grand ambitions of the club’s owners in Qatar.Neymar sought out Firmino for a hug in the moments before kick-off. It was Liverpool’s initial misfortune that the Brazilian superstar had to go to their substitutes’ bench to find him. The eye injury that Firmino sustained at Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday – an abrasion to the cornea – deprived him of his usual place at the heart of Liverpool’s forward line from the start. It also cost Klopp the services of the player who, more than any other, embodies the “offensive defending” the Liverpool manager identified as key to their victory at Wembley and to stopping the dominant force in\u0026nbspFrance.Thankfully for Liverpool, Firmino’s teammates worked tirelessly from the front to limit the opportunities for PSG to release their formidable attacking trio. In doing so they generated the tempo of a knockout tie, with the Anfield atmosphere to match, and the sight of Sadio Mané dispossessing Mbappé deep in the Liverpool half typified the hosts’ relentless approach. As did that of Juan Bernat beating Mohamed Salah in the tackle and trying to launch a quick counterattack, only to turn and pass back to his keeper as four red shirts had closed down his options. Daniel Sturridge, Firmino’s replacement, also gave a selfless performance to make life uncomfortable for the PSG defenders. It is not a situation they are accustomed to in the French league. Salah was subdued by comparison and at fault for PSG’s second goal but his defensive work could not be faulted.Inevitably, given the breathtaking speed and ability in the PSG ranks, the visiting threat could not be nullified completely and Klopp’s head dropped several times when Neymar and Ángel di María escaped behind the Liverpool midfield. “If you let them pass in specific areas they decide alone if they score or not because of the mix of speed and technical abilities,” he had warned. “You have to avoid these situations.” His defence was sharp, however, and PSG had tested Alisson only once before Thomas Meunier reduced a two-goal deficit in the 40th minute.The 25-year-old was making his Champions League debut for Liverpool with Klopp having decided against rotating his goalkeepers in the group stage for a second season running. His first save was routine from Neymar, who broke away from Alexander-Arnold before shooting straight at his compatriot. Edinson Cavani was well placed for the rebound but Virgil van Dijk was quick to apply enough pressure for the Uruguay striker to scuff his effort. There was little the Liverpool No\u0026nbsp1 could do to deny Meunier, who finished expertly after Di María’s cross ricocheted off Robertson.In terms of offensive defending, Klopp could not have wished for more from his team. Milner was dominant while the new central defensive partnership of Van Dijk and Joe Gomez were equal to PSG’s rare breaks until Neymar launched one late run and Mbappé applied the finish. It was not enough to deny Liverpool and Firmino, however. They are up and running again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7a274cc1286219ac3fe86a5c311bf267475668e/0_128_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a86ce9eac02368fcbf212046de95b18","title":"nabil fekir lyon manchester city france champions league","story":"The day after Nabil Fekir joined his France teammates and an estimated million supporters on the Champs-Élysées to show off the World Cup trophy, he was invited to attend another celebration. This time, there were only a few hundred people present at the Stade Francisque-Jomard de Vaulx en Velin – where his father, Mohamed, is president – to catch a glimpse of the town’s most famous son as he was made an honorary citizen. “Thank you all,” whispered a nervous-looking Fekir into the microphone as he addressed the crowd. “We did something beautiful.”As summers go, 2018 will take some beating for the player who turned 25 two days after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia. Despite seeing his proposed £53m move from Lyon to Liverpool collapse days before their opening World Cup match with concerns reported about his fitness following a knee injury, Fekir played a total of 68 minutes in six substitute appearances for Didier Deschamps’s side, including replacing Olivier Giroud in the final.“Winning the World Cup has definitely made it easier for him to move on from Liverpool,” says Dahbia Hattabi, a Lyon-based journalist for website Foot Mercato. “Fekir is a person who is not very expressive but I did not feel he was upset or affected by the failed transfer. When he returned to Lyon he said and repeated several times that it was totally digested. Although he was late to return after the World Cup, we have seen him being fully involved and focused solely on OL.”A brilliant free-kick in the 2-2 draw against Caen at the weekend – his first goal of the season – underlined that Fekir’s mind is back on the job before Lyon’s trip to Manchester City. Nonetheless, having posed for photos wearing a Liverpool shirt and even conducted a welcome interview with the club’s in-house television channel, the sudden collapse of his move must have left a bitter taste. Some reports claimed it was a result of reconstructive surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament injury he suffered against Portugal in September 2015 that caused Liverpool to get cold feet.Back where it began in Villeurbanne – a suburb six kilometres north-east of Lyon’s centre known as the birthplace of seven-times tennis grand slam winner Henri Cochet – they are delighted their hero is still around, at least for now. “This is the first place he comes,” Vaulx-en-Velin’s vice-president Farid Berkani told Le Parisien during July’s triumphant homecoming. “He’s a model for all our young people. A big pride for us.”Fekir’s father, a former amateur player, moved to France from Algeria in 1992 and has spent the past two decades volunteering for the club in National 3 (French football’s fifth tier), which has also produced Kurt Zouma and Rachid Ghezzal among others. His son joined as an eight-year-old before returning at 13 after being released by Lyon for being too small – not the last time he would face rejection. Fekir sports a scar down the left side of his face – the legacy of a childhood accident on a visit to his relatives in Tipaza, an hour west of Algiers – and had the knee condition Osgood–Schlatter disease during adolescence.Lyon, perhaps realising their mistake and with Saint-Étienne sniffing around, re-signed Fekir in 2011 and handed him his first professional contract two years later. He established himself at the heart of an exciting young side that featured Alexandre Lacazette and Corentin Tolisso and was called up to a France junior squad for the first time in October 2014, coming on in the disastrous Under-21 European Championship play-off defeat by Sweden.Five months later, following much debate with his family, Fekir was named in Algeria’s squad for the friendlies against Oman and Qatar, only to withdraw 24 hours later after admitting Deschamps had “changed his mind”.“We are still in shock,” said his grandfather in a tearful interview on Algerian television. “We did not expect Nabil to choose France at all. We really hoped to see him one day wear the national colours, but what can you do?”Fekir made his France debut as a substitute in a friendly against Brazil but having scored his first goal in the 4-3 defeat by Belgium in June 2015, he was injured against Portugal and ended up out for nine months.There were fears he would struggle to recapture his form but last season’s 18 league goals from his favoured No 10 position after coach Bruno Génésio handed him the captain’s armband prompted Atlético Madrid and Bayern Munich to compete with Liverpool for his signature. After late interest in the transfer window from Real Madrid and Chelsea, Lyon are expected to offer a new contract to the player they value at more than €60m. Not that Fekir will concern himself with that.“Look, I’ve told you mate: I do not give a fuck,” he said in an interview with French magazine Onze at the start of February when discussing how much he is worth. “Honestly, whether it’s $20m or $10m … Pfff. I don’t make a fuss.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57fbfeaea1ce71ec5769c04dae693cb047427d3c/0_136_3212_1928/master/3212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63ccaaf192317c5c7b258876a7626a04","title":"psg liverpool thomas tuchel football","story":"A net €750m spent in eight years and that’s all you get? Success without money is all but impossible in the modern game, but wealth brings no guarantees. Football still has the capacity to make the richest of men seem very foolish if they pursue glamour at the expense of substance – a heartening moral, so long as you don’t think too closely about the source of the wealth that is paying for Neymar to squander his immense talents in an entitled fug of self-indulgence.For Paris Saint-Germain, there has been no development. The lessons of last season have not been learned. All the flaws that undid PSG against Real Madrid in last season’s last 16 were there again at Anfield on Tuesday. Leaving three forwards high up the pitch to float about and occasionally turn a trick may be enough in Ligue 1 – given PSG have begun the season with five straight wins and have scored at least three goals in every game, it demonstrably is – but it is no way to play against proper opposition. The Air Jordan branding may be intended to add an extra shot of glamour, but in context it appears to say little more than, “please nutmeg me while I appeal half-heartedly for offside.”There is an irony to this, of course, that PSG’s domination of the French league is precisely what prevents them being truly competitive in Europe. This is the great paradox of the financial structures of the modern game and it one of the factors that will probably lead, sooner rather than later, to some sort of pan-national super-league. When there is no challenge, it’s only natural complacency sets in. When there are no predators at home, why would you flee the red-faced men with sticks and guns? When there is no peril in your league, why would you bother to track Trent Alexander-Arnold?Is Thomas Tuchel happy with this? This, after all, is a man who grew up in the hard-pressing world of the Bundesliga. He was regarded as the new Jürgen Klopp, a manager forged at a similar school. He is somebody who dined with Pep Guardiola after his Dortmund side had lost 5-1 to Bayern, whose love of the theory of juego de posición outweighed the sting of defeat. There can be no version of that conception of the game that features three men standing 50 yards upfield from their midfield, barely raising a jog as a defender surges past them again. PSG football is not Tuchel football it may not even be football.Questions were asked as to why Gareth Southgate had opted to go and watch Mason Mount play for Derby against Blackburn in the Championship rather than seeing Alexander-Arnold take on Neymar, or Jordan Henderson look to impose himself against the grandees of France, but he probably made the right choice. This was no more a gauge of their talents than Einstein doing his times tables would have been of his.In the end, perhaps it was too easy. The second half became a stroll, despite Thomas Meunier halving Liverpool’s lead five minutes before half-time, hooking in a loose ball in the box. Almost 40 minutes of it had passed and PSG not only hadn’t had a shot, they had managed only eight passes in the 30 yards closest to Liverpool’s goal. The game had taken on a weird aspect, as Liverpool, charged for an epic, found it a stroll and found their own focus slipped as a consequence. A lax pass from Mohamed Salah, a quick turnover and Neymar had laid in Kylian Mbappé to equalise. Indulged they may be, but they are still good players. Give them a chance and they will still take it, just as the most decadent of the late Romans would still eat a grape so long as you peeled it first and popped it in their mouths.But most damning of all was what followed. PSG had been gifted a point. They had got away with one of the most disgracefully negligent performances a club of their resources has ever put on. They could go back to Paris and fuel their self-regard with a useful away point. All they had to do was compete for the final seven minutes plus injury time. But they could not.Liverpool, to their immense credit, were able to re-engage. And when placed under pressure again, PSG’s swagger became a whimper. Look at Roberto Firmino’s winner and count how many PSG players have turned away rather than attempt a block: these are basics of defending, of professional self-respect, and they cannot do them.Each season the question seems to become more fundamental: what are PSG? A vanity project for Neymar? A strangely misplaced Nike marketing ploy? A laundromat for Qatar’s international reputation? They’re certainly not a football club in any traditional sense. And if they are supposed to be an agent of Qatari soft power, they really need to start emphasising the power aspect of that phrase rather than the soft."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1e12725ab712f16b7b59d8895a7b5f69f956c9b/0_120_3100_1859/master/3100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4242fdec4ed4a0ca38ad614db7d915a","title":"what is the highest combined shirt number in a football substitution the knowledge","story":"Plus: most international debutants, ugly strips (2) and the largest country never to compete at the European Championships. Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“In the recent Burnley v Olympiakos match, the away team replaced No 56 with No 66, meaning the substitution had a combined shirt number of 122,” notes Paul Hawkins. “Is this the highest shirt ‘value’ in a substitution ever or has it been beaten? And what is the lowest?”For the highest, we start in the Mexican lower leagues. “The rule here is that every player registered by a team at any level has to have an unique number,” explains Jason Maxwell. “So the senior team has standard onetwo-digit numbers, the reserve team has numbers starting with 100, the youth teams go 200, 300, etc. So in a youth game you’ll have 312 replacing 307 or something. Even at the senior team level, if a player has been called up from the reserves or youths they keep their number, so it’s possible to see something like 208 replacing number 19 (especially in a friendly). In July’s friendly between Tigres U-20s and the MLS Homegrown all-stars, every player subbed on for Tigres had a number of 281 or higher, and the highest number subbed off was 304. So at minimum that’s 585 combined.”If we’re sticking to a maximum of two digits, Önder Susam has a suggestion: “Two substitutions from Fenerbahçe’s previous two seasons add up to 191, which I am assuming will be hard to beat. Fenerbahçe’s 2016-17 Europa League qualifier against Grasshoppers had two Fener players (Aatif Chahechouhe, No 92, and Miroslav Stoch, No 99) and the former got substituted for the latter on 71st minute. They both got on the scoresheet. Chahechouhe was brought on for the Spanish striker Roberto Soldado (No 99) last season against Antalyaspor.”Thomas Bristow can top that, with an example from Latvia earlier this month. “Riga FC played bottom side Valmiera at home,” our correspondent reports. “In the 81st minute, flamboyant forward Kamil Bilinski (No 99) was substituted by Thiago Primao (No 93), giving a shirt value substitution of 192.”As for the lowest, Alun Thomas gives us a comprehensive answer for the World Cup and European Championship finals. “There have been a number of substitutions involving Nos 2 and 3, totalling five, which is the lowest possible without involving the No 1 shirt:European Championships1980 final (West Germany v Belgium)On: Bernhard Cullmann (3). Off: Hans-Peter Briegel (2)2016 Group D (Croatia v Czech Republic)On: Sime Vrsalijko (2). Off: Ivan Strinic (3)2016 Group E (Sweden v Republic of Ireland)On: Erik Johansson (3). Off: Mikael Lustig (2).”Can you top that? If so, you know what to do.“Denmark started their match against Slovakia with 11 players who had never played for their national team,” tweets Pablo Miguez. “Except obviously the national teams playing their first match ever, in what other international matches has this happened?”James Dixon is all over this. “France 8-0 Luxembourg, December 1953,” he begins. “France had already qualified for the following year’s World Cup in Switzerland (winning a three-team group that included the Republic of Ireland), so gave debuts to 11 players. Among them was Just Fontaine, who scored a hat-trick in this game, although he wouldn’t win another cap for almost three years.” The rest, as they say, etc and so on. Anyway, here are some match highlights.Last week, we looked at fans’ angry actions following the release of ugly strips. And there are more …“Swedish top-flight team Elfsborg always have been identified by their yellow shirts,” mails Stig Wallerman. “Before the 2017 season (Swedes play spring to autumn), the club presented (on Facebook) a shirt with a faint orange, horizontal striping. The fans raged (“We are yellow!”), the club quickly erased the Facebook posting, ordered a strictly yellow shirt, and the orange stripes were never to be seen again.”Several readers also mailed in to flag up the tale of Barnet’s unpopular 2005-06 home kit, which ended up swapped with their slightly more palatable away one. It did, however, prompt a kit collision with Oxford United, who ended up forced to wear their opponents’ strip to avoid a clash. We touched upon that and other instances in here. And Tim Strafford-Taylor recalls front-page news on Merseyside from 1997 when Everton’s Umbro gear had the wrong colours on its shirt panel.“Which is the largest country never to compete in a European Championship finals?” enquired Rory Saunders in 2008.The Uefa ‘family of nations’ certainly contains its fair share of comatose giants. Amongst the former Soviet newcomers, as Alexei Berezovoi and Rich Perkins have pointed out, Kazakhstan, with an area 2,717,300km² the ninth biggest country in the world, is the largest nation never to appear in a finals. But give them chance, the Kazakhs became part of Uefa only in 2002.Ukraine (603,700km²) comes next – although they’ve solved those pesky qualification issues by gaining a free entry as hosts in 2012.And the bronze goes to Finland, whose 338,145km² has produced Santa Claus, Sibelius and a lot of very good ice hockey players – but only one Jari Litmanen (who, by the by, is also a mean ice hockey player).• For thousands more questions and answers look through our archive.“Richarlison played for Brazil recently against El Salvador,” writes Mike Shaw. “He got subbed after 54 minutes as part of a triple change. One of the players coming on? Everton.

So now is the time for action, to listen to girls and respond, and for all organisations, government, schools and parents to work together to improve the lives of all girls and young women.”Conservative MP Maria Miller, who is chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, said: “#MeToo may have left its mark in Hollywood but for women and girls around the country their ambitions to succeed are still too often met with sexism.“It’s important more women and girls are now speaking out about how this behaviour undermines their confidence and mental health but this harmful, negative behaviour has to be stopped.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51c98ef48952bbb4a95c378d5c2de48eccb52d51/0_436_6500_3901/master/6500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=961f030347619177a6acf1bef00a7ee1","title":"house of fraser administration order sports direct","story":"In early July I ordered a £1,281 sofa from House of Fraser.

It is about what our businesses need. The idea that only high-skilled immigration should be allowed is both ignorant and elitist.”Brian Berry, the chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, warned that his industry would be crippled: “It’s not at all clear that EU workers with important skills already in short supply, like bricklaying and carpentry, will not fall foul of a crude and limited definition of ‘high-skilled’ worker.”Des Gunewardena, the chairman and CEO of D\u0026ampD London, the owner of 40 upmarket restaurants, warned that businesses like his could be affected if the recommendations were taken up. “I’ve got no doubt that if movement of staff becomes difficult, we will need to scale back sharply,” he said.Its report said that the existing tier 2 skilled workers scheme, which currently applies to people outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for skilled jobs earning more than £30,000 a year, could provide a template for a future migration scheme post-Brexit as long as the cap on employing 20,700 people a year was removed.The committee made clear that ministers could develop an alternative immigration policy with the EU, which would be linked to a trade package as part of the exit negotiations. The committee added that did “not express a view on whether immigration should be part of the EU negotiations”.The CBI said it was not a roadmap for a new system for that reason, and said Britain should link an open immigration policy to the trade deals it is able to strike after Brexit.Matthew Fell, the CBI’s policy director, said: “If it is the government’s intention to implement a global system, preferential access for countries where the UK has trade deals will be essential to provide the basis for an open and controlled system that can work for the UK’s economy.”The MAC was set up to advise on the UK’s migration policy after Brexit, with a new regime expected to start when the transition period ends in 2021. It is designed to inform a white paper that has repeatedly been delayed but is due this autumn.The scale of the pushback will strengthen the hand of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, both of whom want to soften the impact of Brexit with a less restrictive immigration policy, although they have to contend with cabinet opposition from Sajid Javid at the Home Office and wider pressure from the hard Brexit wing of the Conservative party.There was even alarm raised among some professional sectors over the MAC proposal that the UK should consider adopting a migration policy along the lines of Canada, which Manning said had “an open, welcoming approach to migration but no free movement agreement with any other country”.Alan Vallance, the chief executive of the Royal Institute of British Architects, said the recommendations “would have profound implications for architecture” because one in five architects working in the UK are already from the EU.EU citizens have, until now, been able to enter the UK freely, seeking work on arrival. Concerns about the impact of free movement is considered to be one of the central reasons why the country voted for Brexit, with the annual 100,000 target for net migration exceeded every year since it was introduced by David Cameron.Net migration to the UK in the year to the end of March 2018 was 270,000, an increase of 28,000 year on year. But net migration from the EU sank to 87,000 in the same period, the lowest level since the Brexit vote in June 2016, according to the most recent set of figures from the Office of National Statistics.Manning said the only area a visa scheme for lower-skilled workers could be required was the “possible exception” of the seasonal agricultural workers scheme. He concluded, in the foreword the MAC’s final report that there would be enough low-skilled workers in the UK because “most of the existing stock will remain and there would likely be a continued flow through family migration or the existing youth mobility scheme”.The MAC report also said EEA migration has had a small impact on wages and employment in the UK, arguing it has had “neither the large negative effects claimed by some, nor the benefits claimed by others”.A related study by Oxford Economics to inform the MAC’s analysis concluded that the average UK-based migrant from the rest of Europe contributed approximately £2,300 more to UK public finances in 201617 than the average UK adult. Each UK-born adult contributed £70 less than the average, it added.Stephen Clarke, a senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “If enacted, these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid and high-skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. This would represent a huge shift for low-paying sectors like food manufacturing, hotels and domestic personnel, where over one in five workers are migrants.”Labour said that it did not accept the distinction between high and low skilled put forward in the report, arguing that any future migration policy should be based on the needs of each industrial sector.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, added: “Labour has said that our immigration policy needs to be based on our economic needs, while meeting our legal obligations and treating people fairly – which means ending the discrimination against non-EU migrants, especially from the Commonwealth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec20bd07e6f04954bef0c5fc518423f73931b805/0_214_4470_2683/master/4470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef9be824bd74dba83a1f2355cc177090","title":"michel barnier rebuffs uk calls for flexibility on irish border","story":"Chief negotiator says EU ready to improve proposal but will not accept British ideas for compromise Michel Barnier has rebuffed British calls for the European Union to soften its stance on the contested issue of the Irish border and said a “moment of truth” was fast approaching on a Brexit deal.May will appeal directly to EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg to soften their stance over UK access to the single market and customs union. She is expected to tell them on Wednesday night that Brussels needs to shift. A senior No 10 official said: “To come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same.”Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, said the bloc was ready to improve its proposal on avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland but stopped short of accepting British ideas for compromise, after the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, called on the EU to show flexibility.“The European council in October will be the moment of truth, it is the moment when we shall see if we have an agreement,” Barnier said.The Irish border has emerged as the biggest stumbling block to the Brexit deal that Theresa May hopes to strike with the EU this autumn. While the EU and UK have agreed there should be no hard border to prevent any return to violence, they are deadlocked over how to manage what will become a 310-mile frontier between the UK and EU.Both sides have proposed fallback plans, known as backstops, that would kick into place if trade talks fail to settle the question. The EU’s involves Northern Ireland following EU law on customs and goods, a plan May has said no British prime minister could ever accept.Barnier said the EU was working to improve its proposal, adding that the problem had been caused by “the UK’s decision to leave the EU, its single market and the customs union”. Seeking to counter British criticism that the EU plan eroded UK sovereignty, he said: “What we talking about here is not a land border, not a sea border, it is a set of technical checks and controls. We respect the territorial integrity of the UK and we respect the constitutional order of the UK.”Barnier was speaking after a 90-minute meeting with the EU’s 27 European affairs ministers at a summit in Brussels. Many countries intervened in the debate to stress the importance of reaching a deal and its timing.Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, got a full update from Barnier on the backstop developments and later described his meeting as “excellent”. The Irish cabinet had earlier agreed to hire 451 new staff for border duties out of a total of 1,077 needed for ports and airports.Ireland is among several EU countries concerned that having an emergency summit in November will take the pressure off the British in the coming weeks.May will appeal to EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg to soften their stance over UK access to the single market and customs union. She is expected to tell them on Wednesday night that Brussels needs to shift. A senior No 10 official said: “To come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same.”Downing Street believes that the UK has developed its negotiating position to reach the Chequers plan and it is now time for other EU countries to show some flexibility in order to finally strike a deal. The prime minister will argue that with “goodwill and determination” the UK and the EU could avoid a “disorderly” Brexit that would be damaging for both sides and instead strike a deal that benefited both.“Neither side can demand the ‘unacceptable’ of the other, such as an external customs border between different parts of the United Kingdom. No other country would accept it if they were in the same situation,” she will say.May will tell her fellow leaders that the EU’s current proposal does not respect the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK as it effectively suggests a customs border down the Irish Sea with its backstop plan.She is expected to deny suggestions by EU officials that the UK is attempting to cherry-pick by seeking the rights of membership without the obligations.“That is not what we are doing,” she will say. “What we are proposing is a fair arrangement that will work for the EU’s economy as well as the UK’s, without undermining the single market.”No 10 has been cautiously optimistic in recent days that the UK can expect a softening of tone at the Salzburg summit from some EU leaders who are keen to nail down a Brexit deal this autumn.It remains to be seen whether that translates into a shift in negotiating position from Brussels, where officials have been more sceptical. The EU27 will wait to discuss next steps, including whether to relax Barnier’s negotiating mandate, until May has left the room.Meanwhile, Brussels is preparing to step up its legal action against the UK in a case of alleged customs fraud. The European commission has accused HM Revenue and Customs of negligence in controls that enabled Chinese fraudsters to evade duties, causing a €2.7bn (£2.4bn) loss to the EU budget.The commission will announce the next step in the process on Wednesday, the final stage before it can take the government to the European court of justice.Brussels launched the action in March, and British officials see the timing of the latest move – on the eve of the Salzburg summit – as provocative. “I can only speculate on the reasons, but it seems pretty obvious what is going on,” a No 10 insider said.A government spokesman said: “The UK does not accept liability for the alleged losses or recognise the estimate of alleged duty evaded. We take customs fraud very seriously and we continue to evolve our response as new threats emerge.”The alleged fraud has raised tensions between the EU and UK, contributing to mistrust about British officials’ ability to collect duties on behalf of the bloc, as proposed by the government in its unprecedented customs partnership."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/078558979c3076937f0dd1f85cfb784dbfd2ce43/0_213_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8f763a70b38c0b9969dcf845e951565","title":"labour conference path mps crucial brexit vote jeremy corbyn","story":"Dominant issue on conference agenda presents formidable challenge for Corbyn and partyJeremy Corbyn will kick off Labour’s annual conference at Pier Head in Liverpool on Saturday with one of the noisy rallies that have become a kind of political comfort zone over his three years as party leader: soundtrack from The Farm, an uplifting tirade against social injustice, cheering, optimistic crowds.But the dominant issue on the agenda is one that presents a formidable political challenge for Corbyn and the Labour party: Brexit.When Theresa May brings her Brexit deal back to parliament for MPs’ approval – perhaps within weeks – what happens next won’t just be critical for Britain’s future, but a moment of truth for Corbyn’s Labour party, and the wave of popular support that helped him sweep away the Tories’ majority last June.Brexit would have been a headache for Labour, whoever its leader. The party’s electoral fortunes have long depended on bridging the gap between “Hampstead and Hull”, as Andy Burnham called it during the referendum campaign.Voters’ 2016 decision to leave the European Union, and the brand of populist, identity-based politics the campaign unleashed, struck at the heart of that already-fragile coalition.Add to that the instinctive Euroscepticism of some in Corbyn’s inner circle, and the ardent Europeanism of many of the younger (and indeed older) members who swept into the party to support him, and every step has been a balancing act.At last year’s general election, the judgment of Labour’s strategists that Britain’s voters didn’t want politicians to spend the seven week campaign banging on about Brexit appeared to pay off. While Tim Farron’s Lib Dems talked of little else (apart from his attitude to gay sex), and May tried to win over voters by saying the Labour leader would be “alone and naked in the negotiating chamber of the European Union”, Corbyn talked about living standards, schools cuts and workers’ rights.Former Corbyn adviser Matt Zarb-Cousin said: “I actually think the political strategy for dealing with Brexit, as something that Labour didn’t want – it didn’t call the referendum – has been very, very good. They could very easily have fallen into a trap where we oppose it, oppose article 50: and then I dread to think what would have happened in the last election, if that had been the case – given that most constituencies were leave, and Brexit was still very much fresh in people’s minds.”But ambiguity became less tenable as the negotiations in Brussels advanced. So Labour’s position has necessarily evolved, through a series of fraught internal negotiations – and sometimes outright confrontation.When shadow cabinet members arrived at the Brexit subcommittee in January, they were each handed a numbered copy of a policy paper, which they were to give back at the end of the meeting.Since before Christmas, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, had been arguing for the party to announce that it would advocate joining a customs union with the EU after Brexit. He and his team believed it was essential to safeguarding manufacturing supply-chains, and avoiding a hard border in Ireland. He had presented a paper arguing the point to Loto (leader of the opposition), as Corbyn’s office is known.But close allies of the leader were sceptical. Some were anxious about appearing to be railroaded into a policy shift by noisy advocates of a customs union on Labour’s backbenches – Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie and others. Others were keen to ensure any stance the party ultimately took could reconcile leavers and remainers, and believed Starmer was ratcheting Labour’s policy, step by step, towards a position that would look to the average leave voter like a bid to overturn Brexit.So the inner core of Corbyn’s team – which includes Jon Trickett and Diane Abbott, as well as key advisers such as Seumas Milne and Andrew Fisher – had decided on an alternative approach. They would table their own paper, kicking the customs union issue into the long grass.To Starmer’s evident fury, Corbyn began reading aloud from a pad. As the meeting went on, it became clear several of those present had seen the paper in advance – but the shadow Brexit secretary, the man responsible for Labour’s policy, had not.Visibly angry, Starmer made clear that he fundamentally disagreed with the approach outlined in the paper. Others spoke in his support, including Labour’s leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, and the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith – whose open disagreement with the leadership’s position would lead to his sacking a few weeks later.Several people present at the meeting told the  the general feeling in the room was that Starmer was willing to resign, rather than sign up to a paper with which he disagreed. “He looked close to telling them to shove it – and I think that did count for something,” said one person present. “I think Jeremy was slightly surprised at how angry Keir was.”Another said: “Jeremy started speaking, and Keir just said, ‘enough,’ this was just completely outrageous. He did lose his temper. I think they were genuinely shocked at his reaction. They tried to bounce him and it completely backfired.”When it became clear the cost of stalling on a customs union could be losing the shadow Brexit secretary – one of the few resignees in the “chicken coup” of summer 2016 who had been tempted back on to the frontbench, and a reassuring figure for many in the PLP – Corbyn blinked. The paper was collected at the end of the meeting and never seen again. “The text got dumped,” said one of those present.That dramatic moment marked the low point for relations between Starmer’s team and the leadership. Little more than a month later, Corbyn made a speech at a slick event at a car factory in Coventry, which shifted the party’s position to recommending a customs union.Drafts were painstakingly negotiated in advance with the Brexit subcommittee, and signed off by the shadow cabinet. The move was balanced with a series of criticisms of the EU single market, which Corbyn’s aides spun as central to the thrust of the speech.Trickett said the position they ultimately reached was the right compromise. “I can say to remainers: we intend to remain as close as we can to the single market, and inside a customs union,” he said. “Equally I can say to Brexiteers, that we are going to have an interventionist industrial and regional strategy, which means that for the first time in 30 years, the government can intervene to rebuild the economy that was devastated by the Thatcher settlement.”He added: “The country remains deeply ided. We have to seek a synthesis between the Brexiters and the remainers creating a principled vision of another kind of society which can allow both sides to go away with honour.”All sides attest that there has since been a more collaborative approach at Labour’s top table. But the clash revealed fierce tensions over how to funnel the constructive ambiguity of last year’s general election manifesto stance towards a coherent response to the ultimate question every one of its 257 MPs will have to face in the next few weeks: can they support May’s Brexit deal?Corbyn himself is often blamed as the driving force behind Labour’s willingness to endorse Brexit – whipping his MPs to support article 50, and rejecting key elements of the single market – but attendees at the Coventry speech drafting session recall the leader being less attached to the criticisms of the EU competition regime, for example, than his cerebral lieutenant, Milne.Corbyn is certainly instinctively Eurosceptic, but his friends insist he is no enthusiast for Brexit. “I think he finds it completely insufferable I think he just wants to get through it,” said one close ally. Zarb-Cousin, who worked in Loto in the build-up to the article 50 vote, said: “The idea that Seumas is a Brexiteer is nonsense Corbyn the same. Of course there’s a strain of Euroscepticism on the left – but who isn’t a bit Eurosceptic?”Meanwhile, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell – Corbyn’s longtime political soulmate and brother-in-arms – is repeatedly described by those close to the heart of Labour’s Brexit decision-making as pragmatic and tactical – certainly more so than his rabble-rousing reputation might suggest.The 2017 manifesto stated Labour’s principles in approaching the negotiations – it would put a “strong emphasis on retaining the benefits of the single market and the customs union,” and “put jobs and the economy first” – but left plenty of wriggle-room for candidates with different shades of opinion and space for Labour’s policy to develop as the negotiations went on.But it didn’t take long for the veneer of unity created by the campaign to crack. Just three weeks after the June general election, when MPs had barely unpacked their boxes and settled into their new offices, the group of anti-Brexit rebels derisively nicknamed the “shinies” by colleagues, laid down a marker for the battles ahead by tabling an amendment to the Queen’s speech, calling for the government to keep Britain in the single market and the customs union.Three MPs resigned from junior roles to back it, and they were joined by 46 others, in defiance of the exasperated Labour whips – an extraordinary rebellion so early in a brand new parliament.“From that moment, we knew the EEA was going to be a big issue for us,” said one senior adviser. The leadership were furious. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, went public to say Umunna and his colleagues were “virtue signalling”.The shinies – Umunna, Chris Leslie, Stephen Doughty, Stephen Kinnock and a shifting group of others – share few political views with the hardline Tory European Research Group (ERG) but their modus operandi is strikingly similar: the WhatsApp-driven whipping operation the frequent media appearances the fervent belief in their cause and the willingness to resort to any and every parliamentary tactic to exert pressure on their leadership.Time and again over the past 12 months and more, Labour unity has been severely tested over Brexit. Corbyn and his colleagues have consistently been accused of dithering, or vacillating, or lack of clarity.But senior party strategists insist they have taken a deliberate decision not to get tangled up in the fine detail of Brexit – and to let May play the lead role.“We want to talk about things that people care about – and ways in which Brexit impacts the things that people care about. Things that impact people’s pay, their public services, their living standards – not some rather technical stuff, like max-fac,” said one senior adviser.“The whole process has been miles away from the people. It’s been like the bubble, condensed. The challenge for all of us, and has been all the way through, is how do you burst through that into being able to talk about the principles around Brexit?”In May, the festering ision over the EEA issue flared up again in the Lords. Labour’s leader in the upper house, Angela Smith, had led a painstaking, cross-party process to gather support around a series of amendments to the EU withdrawal bill, which they believed had a good chance of winning a strong majority – and crucially, the support of MPs, when the legislation went back to the House of Commons.But the shinies, frustrated at the refusal of Corbyn and his frontbench colleagues to force the issue of a softer Brexit, took the unusual step of launching a lobbying operation in the “other place”, as MPs call the Lords, to persuade Labour peers they should back an amendment – rejected by Lady Smith – that would commit the government to trying to negotiate membership of the EEA.Smith – and Starmer, with whom she works closely – were absolutely furious. They were affronted by the MPs’ audacity in taking their war with the leadership to the Lords. That set up another brash confrontation in the Commons, when the legislation was sent back to MPs. Starmer has long argued against the EEA, believing it fails to solve the Irish border problem – because members are not part of a customs union – and would leave Britain a “rule-taker”.The debate painfully exposed isions, with Caroline Flint, MP for Don Valley, saying she believed the amendment was aimed at subverting the referendum result.Starmer sought to defuse the row by tabling Labour’s own amendment, taking another incremental step towards the single market by promising to seek “shared institutions”, and Labour whips urged MPs to abstain.But ultimately, the party split three ways, in an odd double-rebellion that underlined the capacity of the Brexit issue to create complex political isions.Both sides remain angry about what the leadership saw as a confected spat, aimed at embarrassing Corbyn and the remain MPs saw it as a failure by Starmer in particular to grasp an opportunity to soften Brexit.It is against this fraught background that the Labour frontbench – and each inidual MP – will have to decide whether to support May’s Brexit deal. Formally, Starmer has laid out six tests.Some, such as “does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU?” seem loosely worded enough to be fudgeable. But test two, “does it secure the exact same benefits as we currently have as members of the single market and the customs union?” appears impossible to meet, at least on May’s current trajectory, boxed in as she is by her own self-imposed red lines, which are rigorously policed by the extremists in her party. So it has long appeared inevitable Labour will whip its MPs to vote down the deal.Privately, some Labour MPs believe the six tests were set up as a figleaf to allow the party to reject just about any deal as a “Tory Brexit”, in the hope of triggering a general election and catapulting Corbyn into Downing Street.Labour’s iconoclastic shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, hinted at that view in April at a private meeting, a recording of which was subsequently leaked to the website Red Roar. One party aide recalled that when the first reports emerged, suggesting Gardiner had referred to the six tests as “shibboleths”, the reassuring response from Loto was that the public wouldn’t know what a shibboleth was. That counsel proved less soothing when the full recording emerged, in which he was heard to call them “bollocks”. Starmer was livid, Gardiner was reined in, and some MPs have referred to him ever since as “Barry Bollocks”. But the general sense remains that it would take a significant change of position from the prime minister – one she is highly unlikely to take – for the frontbench to throw their weight behind a deal.That sets the scene for a seismic political moment, whenever the so-called meaningful vote is held. May’s narrow majority, even with the DUP’s backing, means if all of Labour’s MPs – and its three independents, John Woodcock, Frank Field and Jared O’Mara – vote against, it would take fewer than 10 Tory rebels to defeat the government. Every single MP will count.Yet in these topsy-turvy times, with the bonds of party loyalty loosened by the solvent of Brexit, it is no forgone conclusion that Labour MPs will fall into line. Labour whips, and Starmer’s team, have already begun the task of working on potential rebels.Downing Street, in the person of May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, has already made contact with Labour centrists on occasion in recent months – and the Tories will push hard the idea that by opposing the agreement, MPs are tacitly backing Jacob Rees-Mogg, Peter Bone and the other “Brextremists”.But a significant complicating factor is the growing momentum behind calls for the issue of Brexit to be settled with a second referendum – or a “People’s Vote”, as one deep-pocketed campaign group has it.Labour strategists remain deeply sceptical about the politics and the practicalities of a referendum. They believe the time before Brexit day is too short polling doesn’t support the idea unless it is sliced and diced so much as to be all but meaningless and they believe leave voters would be infuriated by the prospect of being asked to confront the question again. Gardiner has expressed that view publicly, suggesting it could even lead to “civil disobedience”.One senior Labour figure wearily described a second Brexit vote as a “red herring” another even suggested it would play into May’s hands, by strengthening her argument that if leavers did not back her deal, Brexit could be unpicked.“The only way that their deal is going to get voted down, is if some of the ERG vote against it – and they’re not voting against it if they believe one of the options then is a second referendum,” the Labour figure said. “The surefire way to get the ERG to vote with the government is to talk about a second referendum.”But outside team Corbyn, the pressure to back a second poll is mounting. Smith says: “I would personally prefer another general election, and a clean cut, ‘you can’t handle this, prime minister, you need another government to deal with it.’ But we may be coming to that point where people are clamouring for another vote.”Meanwhile, a handful of Labour MPs for whom frustrating Brexit is a goal that outranks all others – and whose loyalty to Corbyn was always wafer-thin – are watching and waiting. If the moment comes to take a stand against leaving – at a new referendum, for example – and the frontbench refuses to take it, they are ready to splinter away.If Brexit goes ahead, they are laying the groundwork for a breakaway party that would claim it could reunite a fractured country. How large a number of MPs follows this small band of diehards will depend in large part on how the party conducts itself in this crucial next six months, until Brexit D-day in March next year.One leftwing MP who has been supportive of Corbyn’s leadership said: “Brexit is a symptom, and it has to be seen in the context of people’s dissatisfaction with the status quo. It’s the same forces that created Brexit that have led to Jeremy and John so you can’t say, ‘if only Brexit hadn’t happened we could have had a clear run.’ They came in on the same wave – and now they have to find a way to disentangle themselves from that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5e5c62933cb5ba219514185a021304afd1a2608/352_164_4121_2473/master/4121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4faff85ea8a52e3de4c7911823d6d7a4","title":"tory london mayor candidate condemns zac goldsmiths 2016 campaign","story":"Andrew Boff said racial overtones were mistaken after prompt from Muslim bodyOne of the three Conservative London mayoral candidates has broken ranks to criticise Zac Goldsmith’s controversial 2016 campaign, after the Muslim Council of Britain wrote to them to ask if they would condemn its racial overtones.Andrew Boff said he believed Goldsmith’s attacks on Labour rival candidate Sadiq Khan were a “mistaken tactic”, while the other two candidates responded with a joint statement that sidestepped the issue by not mentioning the party’s previous campaign.That prompted the MCB to criticise the other candidates, early favourite Shaun Bailey and his lesser-known rival, Joy Morrissey.An MCB spokesman said: “Muslim Londoners would have expected all Tories seeking the votes of Londoners to clearly set themselves apart from this shameful episode, but it is deeply disappointing to see that is not the case for two of the candidates.”The MCB had written to three of the party’s mayor candidates last month “to ask for your views on Mr Goldsmith’s strategic campaign to focus on Sadiq Khan’s faith and background in an effort to win the election”.The Goldsmith campaign was first criticised for attempting to ide voters when leaflets emerged targeting Hindu voters that suggested Khan would tax their jewellery if he became London’s mayor.His campaign then tried to accuse the now mayor of London of associating with alleged extremists before he became an MP, although that backfired when one of those cited turned out to be a Tory supporter.All three Conservative candidates initially responded to the MCB’s request for comment with a joint statement. It said: “We celebrate that London is the most open, erse and tolerant city in the world, and we support all efforts to keep our capital open and integrated between all our communities.“We welcome and support interfaith initiatives that foster dialogue and increase understanding such as the excellent ‘Visit my Mosque’ day.”Shaun Bailey, a London assembly member, was endorsed by the London Evening Standard on Tuesday, making him the frontrunner in the race for the party’s nomination. He was a youth worker who became an adviser to David Cameron on young people and crime before being elected.Ballot papers went out this week and the result is expected in time for the party’s annual conference this month.Morrissey is a councillor in Ealing, who works at the Centre for Social Justice thinktank. Boff is a libertarian politician who has been an assembly member since 2008 and has previously voiced concern about the Goldsmith campaign.He also endorsed the MCB’s call for an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory party, but that has been repeatedly rejected by the party’s hierarchy, even after the controversy over a Boris Johnson’s comments comparing fully veiled Muslim women to letter boxes and bank robbers. A spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain added: “We welcome Boff’s call for an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party, and his distancing from Zac Goldsmith’s campaign.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5de0e8b25d328945ea03435386e4adeb38ff08a3/232_5_2804_1683/master/2804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5612295bbb2a6203aefdcc589f9db471","title":"brexit salzburg eu summit theresa may tells tories not to look down on people in social housing politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including EU leaders arriving at Salzburg for the start of their informal summitThis is from Yahoo’s Brussels correspondent, Luke James.Theresa May has two Brexit-related articles in the papers today. She has written an article about the UK’’s stance for the German paper, Die Welt. As my colleague Daniel Boffey reports, in it she attacks criticisms tabled by Michel Barnier of her Chequers proposals, claiming the EU negotiator’s arguments are out of step with reality and make unacceptable demands on the British government.She has also given an interview to the . In it, she restates her opposition to allowing a vote on the final Brexit deal. She says:When the referendum took place, we gave people the opportunity to make a choice. They made that choice. If we as politicians want people to trust us, then we have to deliver for them on that.This was probably the biggest exercise in democracy in our country’s history. If we were to go back on that vote, it would destroy trust in politicians.The parliamentary vote to give the choice to the people wasn’t a close run thing, a five to one or six to one vote to say to the public it’s your choice.People weren’t saying it’s the choice of the public except if we disagree with the answer we’ll ask them again. It was the public’s choice. My answer to the People’s Vote is that we’ve had the people’s vote – it was the referendum – and now we should deliver on it.UPDATE: It wasn’t just Die Welt the May article was sent to a range of European newspapers, I’m told.Theresa May has just finished delivering his housing speech. Number 10 briefed out a large chunk of it overnight, but my colleague Peter Walker was listening and he has tweeted out some new lines.David Davis, who resigned as Brexit secretary because he could not accept the Chequers plan for Brexit, told the Today programme this morning that EU leaders would come out with “warm words” for Theresa May at Salzburg but that “they won’t give much”.He said he expected the EU to demand more from the UK, and that May would end up with “a deal she won’t be able to bring back to the House of Commons because it’ll be lumbered with loads of other EU demands”. At that point May would have to try something else, he said.I think we get to a point where she will not be able to accept what they offer, they will not be able to accept what she offers, and there’ll have to have some sort of reset. The reset is to step back to what Donald Tusk offered in March - he said you can have a free trade agreement.In the interview Davis was also asked about the suggestion from Michael Gove, the environment secretary, that MPs should accept a Chequers-based deal because, once out of the EU, the UK could always revisit it. He replied:Michael Gove is a very clever man, and sometimes clever men miss the obvious. The very obvious point is we have a negotiating lever today. We have 39bn of them - the £39bn contribution we’re going to make in the withdrawal agreement. Once we’ve signed that away, our negotiating leverage evaporates and we will not get it straightened out.On the Today programme this morning James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, was asked who Theresa May is referring to when she talks of politicians who look down on people living in social housing. (See 9.17am.) “I think it’s more a sort of a greater public perception, sadly,” he replied.When asked if there were Conservative politicians who took that view, he said May was referring to a “general stigma” which he said was a feeling among tenants who were consulted for a government policy paper. He went on:I think home ownership absolutely is a really core credo of what I believe and what the party believes, and I don’t think there’s this, almost, like, a false dichotomy of it being one thing or the other - social housing or actually seeing home ownership as well. I think we can do both. Turning back to Brexit, last night Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said that the EU was willing to “improve” its offer to the UK on the Irish backstop. In a press statement he said:Our proposal for the backstop on Ireland and Northern Ireland has been on the table since February.It is an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, whatever the future relationship will bring.It reflects our agreement with the UK in December 2017, confirmed by Prime Minister Theresa May in her letter to President Tusk in March.We are ready to improve this proposal.Work on the EU side is ongoing.We are clarifying which goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed.We can also clarify that most checks can take place away from the border, at the company premises or in the market.We need to de-dramatise the checks that are needed and that are caused by the UK’s decision to leave the EU, its Single Market and customs union.What we need in the Withdrawal Agreement is a legally operational backstop, which fully respects the territorial integrity of the UK.As Jennifer Rankin and Pippa Crerar point out in their overnight story, Barnier’s offer was in fact a limited one. He is not accepting the UK plan for a backstop, and, in so far as he is making a concession, it seems to be more a matter of tone than substance.But this morning the DUP, which is helping to prop up Theresa May’s minority government, has again rejected his approach. Nigel Dodds, the party’s deputy leader, says Barnier is proposing “still means a border down the Irish Sea”.On the day Theresa May became prime minister she gave a short speech in Downing Street saying that her mission would be to fight “burning injustice” and to champion those families who are “just managing”. Since then these aspirations have almost vanished from her political agenda, submerged by Brexit, but occasionally this anti-elitist, surprisingly lefty side of May resurfaces and it will again today when she gives a speech urging her party to abandon its bias against people who live in social housing. As well as announcing an extra £2bn for housing associations, she will say:For many people, a certain stigma still clings to social housing. Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority.And on the outside, many people in society – including too many politicians – continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home ...We should never see social housing as something that need simply be “good enough”, nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better.The Daily , ever sensitive to the politics of property, has splashed on her comments, pointing out that there is an implied rebuke to Margaret Thatcher, who fetishised (my word, not theirs) home ownership. When May talked about “too many politicians”, she is not referring primarily to the opposition.May is delivering her speech this morning. But soon afterwards she, and the news agenda, will be sucked back into the Brexit vortex as she heads to Austria for the informal summit of EU leaders at Salzburg. I will post more on that shortly.Here is the agenda for the day.10.15am: Theresa May gives a speech to the national housing summit. As Peter Walker reports, she will announce £2bn in extra money for housing associations over a decade, arguing that secure long-term funding for new schemes is one of the key ways to ease the housebuilding crisis.Afternoon: May and other EU leaders arrive in Salzburg in Austria for the start of an informal EU summit.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up, probably at around 6pm.Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news.

The letter highlighted what it called the show’s “stigmatising portrayal of disability” and was signed by a Nobel laureate as well as film-makers, writers and activists including Monica Lewinsky and Lena Dunham.Billed as portraying “baffling symptoms and controversial diagnoses”, the show follows patients as they search for treatments and some relief. But it was alleged in an article in the LA Times that producers used “unethical practices”, editing footage to suggest participants’ medical conditions were psychosomatic disorders, using few expert doctors and focusing on sceptical medics who cast doubt on whether the iniduals were ill at all (that science doesn’t understand many health conditions doesn’t make their symptoms less real).The article points out that Dan Partland, the executive producer of the series, said the aim “was to give the world a compassionate window into the difficulties of patients and families struggling with elusive and misunderstood illnesses”. Yet the participants themselves are at the forefront of the criticism. Last month, several of those included in the series wrote a joint post on Medium titled The Truth Behind Netflix’s Afflicted. Participants in the show have been harassed online and have written that they have even been physically threatened or received death threats.These are people who trusted the programme-makers to help spread understanding of their conditions to the public, and say they were rewarded by having their lives mocked to peddle prejudice. As Jill Maxi Edelstein, who has multiple chemical sensitivity, wrote in her essay criticising the show: “I trusted you with my heart and my story, and now you are using it against me and my people.”But this isn’t simply about hurt feelings. As the letter says, Netflix reaches 300 million viewers worldwide and its programmes have the power to “reinforce barriers to appropriate medical care or disability benefits, dampen the support of vital research, and add to the stigma and social isolation of an already profoundly marginalised group of people”. There is a long history of disability being used as entertainment, from TV following rare medical conditions to dwarf wrestling – modern-day Victorian freak shows.When groups are stereotyped on TV, it does not just reflect the prejudices of the time but can be key in perpetuating them. Distorted depictions can be particularly damaging for people with chronic illnesses – who are typically disbelieved and told: “‘It’s all in your head,” but this goes for many minorities whose lives are used as entertainment fodder for the majority. The residents on Benefits Street, the Channel 4 documentary centred on a deprived Birmingham community, became synonymous with the “scrounger” rhetoric in the early years of cuts to the welfare budget. White Dee, one of the central figures in the show, later said the way she and her neighbours were portrayed “ripped us apart”, although a senior Channel 4 executive insisted that it was important to tell the stories of “distressed parts of our society”.Shows that purport to do good can fall into this trap. My Week As a Muslim, in which a white woman went “undercover” to understand Islamophobia, was criticised for using “brown-face” and centring the story on white people. If you want to understand racism, perhaps just listen to its victims.Controversy sells and programme-makers can create hate figures or a “freak” for added revenue. This gets more worrying in the age of social media. When television comes with hashtags, producers may whip up a crowd and then let them loose on their target.Ultimately, it is not simply bad publicity caused by an open letter that is going to talk companies such as Netflix into being responsible – it is viewers who can send the loudest message by switching off. Besides, who wants to watch ill people’s lives being exploited?“The spirit of much of what has been the #MeToo movement is to ide men and women,” Sean Penn opined this week. It is funny to say it is women speaking out about assault that is isive for the sexes rather than, say, the fact that men keep assaulting. As McDonald’s staff in the US launch an unprecedented strike against sexual harassment, there’s a sense that women are fighting back – and a contingent of men are feeling their dominance is threatened by the whole thing.The alleged victim of Trump’s nominee for the US supreme court – nominated by a pussy grabber, no less – has dared to speak up. Brett Kavanaugh has denied the allegation. “If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. We can all be accused of something,” responded a lawyer close to the White House.The question, of course, is whether these men “should be worried” because they’ve done nothing wrong – or they have and are disturbed that they may no longer be able to get away with it. As Penn went on, #MeToo is just “too black and white”. Assault is such a grey area, isn’t it? It’s the flipside to the idea that consent is too complex for men to understand – as if you may accidentally rape a woman as you try to ask her out. (Neither sex comes out of this well.)Consent, apparently, is simultaneously too complicated and too simplistic. Women – hysterical, isive, or vindictive – will throw accusations around and men can’t even flirt without a feminist trying to destroy them. Whether it’s at a McDonald’s or the supreme court bench, time is increasingly up on lazy, misogynistic excuses. If women speaking out is so unpalatable to men such as Trump, I’d suggest they’re doing something right.“What brings you here after all this time?,” asks a now grownup Jane in the new trailer for Mary Poppins Returns. A film industry running out of ideas and a profit-driven market! Perhaps I’m in a millennial crisis, but what’s Poppins without Julie Andrews or little Michael’s knobbly knees? That Dick Van Dyke has reprised his elderly banker role but is now nearly as old as the character he played first time round is like a dystopian microcosm of the remake age: we’re doomed to watch our youths be rehashed poorly – and the only reward is more grey hairs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66df92547558306ea57d6e33fdfc4a226a3498c2/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d9129e42749b1ff3201c06878683209","title":"umpire suspended for helping nick kyrgios at us open","story":"Umpire Mohamed Lahyani has been suspended from his next two scheduled tournaments for trying to encourage Nick Kyrgios during a match at the US Open.Lahyani took the unusual step of climbing down from his chair and having a lengthy chat with the Australian during the second-round match against Pierre-Hugues Herbert, when Kyrgios was showing little effort as he trailed by a set and 3-0 down.The umpire was heard to say: “I want to help you. You are great for tennis. I know this is not you.”Kyrgios went on to turn the match around to progress, with an annoyed Herbert claiming afterwards he felt Lahyani had overstepped the mark – sentiments also backed up by the likes of Roger Federer.US Open officials decided while Lahyani “went beyond protocol” in his actions, the umpire was allowed to continue in the chair for the rest of the tournament but stressed he should “adhere to proper protocols”.However, governing body ATP has now conducted its own internal review, and confirmed in a statement Lahyani, one of seven full-time umpires on the tour, had been suspended from the next two scheduled events – the China Open in Beijing and the Rolex Shanghai Masters.“Lahyani’s actions in the match were deemed to have compromised the impartiality that is required of an official. Lahyani will return to work at the Intrum Stockholm Open in October,” a statement read.“Despite the incident taking place at the US Open, under the jurisdiction of the United States Tennis Association, the incident was still subject to ATP disciplinary action due to Lahyani’s position as a full-time ATP employee and the high standards the ATP requires of its chair umpires regardless of the event to which he or she is assigned, in order to maintain the integrity of the tour.”ATP executive vice president of rules and competition Gayle David Bradshaw described Lahyani as a “world-class and highly-respected official”, but stressed “his actions during the match crossed a line that compromised his own impartiality as a chair umpire”.Bradshaw continued in a statement: “Although well-intended, his actions were regrettable and cannot go without disciplinary action on our own tour.“We know that he will learn from this experience and we look forward to welcoming him back in October.”Speaking at the time of the controversial incident at Flushing Meadows, Kyrgios – who has been penalised for a lack of best effort in the past – insisted the brief pep talk had little effect.“I’m not sure it was encouragement. He said he liked me. He just said that it’s not a good look,” the Australian said.“I wasn’t feeling good. I know what I was doing out there wasn’t good. I wasn’t really listening to him, but I knew it wasn’t a good look. It didn’t help me at all.”It was the first of two major incidents involving umpires at the US Open, with Serena Williams handed a game penalty after a tirade against match official Carlos Ramos in the women’s final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72bb0170697d5f06d9459cefe13faed69dc99506/130_0_3735_2242/master/3735.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a51935e5d640c4ba922d5e7d96eaa452","title":"strolling in swansea city walk dylan thomas art poetry history","story":"The creator of September’s Now the HeroNawr Yr Arwr theatre event takes a walk through his hometown, shining a light on its artistic treasures, old and new Post-industrial Swansea is still the “ugly, lovely town” Dylan Thomas grew up in a century ago. It is a fascinating approach if you arrive by train, passing the harsh realities of Port Talbot on your left, which allegedly inspired the dystopian cityscapes for director Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner. You curve round to the pleasant view of Swansea Bay, flanked on the far side by the Mumbles and its lighthouse, which marks the near side of the Gower peninsula. It’s a fantastic panorama, like welcoming arms waiting to give you a big cwtch (a Welsh embrace) as you pull into the city.The bay lends itself to the opening scenes of this month’s Now the HeroNawr yr Arwr, an immersive theatrical experience in which performers lead audiences on a journey through the city, my hometown, and its artistic treasures. The show, which I developed with a team of collaborators, including fellow Welshman Owen Sheers, begins at a shipping container on the beach adjacent to the 360 Cafe.Back at the station, the first thing you see when you come through the ticket barrier on your right is a small picture of Peter Ham, the Welsh lead singer of Badfinger, who co-wrote the song Without You (covered by Harry Nilsson and Mariah Carey) and committed suicide in 1975 aged 27. It’s nice that this tribute takes precedence over Dylan Thomas but you come face to face with the poet when you step outside the station in the shape of a cartoon-like mural portrait by Pete Fowler, the artist who provides all the artwork for the Super Furry Animals. It’s worn but beautiful, a bit like Swansea. The pavement outside the station bears the words “Ambition is critical.” This is a riposte to a quotation often incorrectly attributed to Thomas, that Swansea is the “graveyard of man’s ambitions”. They had fun with it in the film Twin Town, the great Swansea movie from the 90s. It’s since been updated from discreet silver lettering to bright, bold red, which feels in keeping with the ongoing cultural regeneration of the city.Head down High Street, which has been neglected, though artists are now driving its revitalisation, with lots of shops having been taken over by galleries. Look out for Volcano Theatre, which has its own gallery. Above it is a giant painting of Elizabeth Taylor, she’s shedding a tear made by the Swansea graffiti artist Pure Evil. There is something mournful about it: perhaps she’s crying for Swansea – forever the bridesmaid to Cardiff’s bride. Other new landmarks include Galerie Simpson, led by Jane Simpson, who is well-connected because of her association with the YBAs (whose number include Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin). Continue along High Street before turning right onto College Street for more art at the eclectic Elysium Gallery.Arrive at Castle Square, named after the much-diminished ruin that dates back to the early-12th century. It’s a redoubtable survivor given that much of Swansea’s centre was destroyed by the Luftwaffe over three nights in February 1941. It was targeted because of the docks and you can explore that history in the National Waterfront Museum. To get there, walk down the architecturally wonderful Wind Street (locally known as Wine Street), which is quiet by day but lively at night – because all the banks have been taken over by bars, pubs and clubs.As well as its permanent display, the National Waterfront Museum, which is on Oystermouth Road, has a lovely new feature called GRAFT. It’s an edible landscape work developed by local artist Owen Griffiths in association with the museum and community groups. A barren courtyard has been transformed into a community garden that feeds local charities.Cross into Somerset Place, firmly in the Maritime Quarter, where the Grade II-listed Morgans Hotel (town house doubles from £100 B\u0026ampB, main hotel doubles from £125 B\u0026ampB) is particularly grandiose. Completed in 1903, its seafaring associations are visible inside: pop your head in to look at stained-glass windows with a maritime influence and a mural featuring tall-masted ships on the River Tawe (the city’s Welsh name Abertawe means mouth of the River Tawe) you may even see Bonnie Tyler sipping bubbles at the bar.From the Maritime Quarter, head out onto the beachfront path and admire the view of Mumbles over the water until you reach the stanchions, two stone staircases by Oystermouth Road that look like a bridge that’s not a bridge. Its “bridge” part was controversially removed for restoration but never returned.Cross Oystermouth road, go down St Helen’s Road and left onto Victoria Avenue, a typical red-brick terrace at the end of which you are confronted by the splendid flank of Swansea Guildhall, opened in 1934. Head inside the front door for the most spectacular surprise. The building itself has beautiful Grecian decorations but the main event is the Brangwyn Hall, a vast, sparse space that the council has beautifully restored and where hangs a series of enormous panels by the artist Frank Brangwyn. The panels were originally commissioned as a first world war commemoration for the House of Lords but were rejected as “too colourful and lively”. Swansea bid for them instead and had to extend the ceiling of the hall considerably in order to accommodate them.Brangwyn’s intention was to make something beautiful out of tragedy, and pay tribute to the people of the empire called upon to save Britain. In this sparse hall you are drawn to 16 vast superabundant images depicting the peoples and produce of the empire. The Brangwyn Panels are a celebration linking Swansea to the rest of the world, which you can explore further via the many restaurants if you catch a bus or cab back into the city centre.Marc Rees’ Now the HeroNawr Yr Arwr runs over five nights (25-29 September) from 6.30-9pm (tickets £12£15), starting at Swansea Beach.

No show has proved this more recently than Love Island. Where critics once had an authoritative hold over TV discourse, Twitter is now where the big conversations – whether on racism or whether wearing a thong bikini every day for two weeks is likely to induce thrush – take place. Similarly, hopping over to Instagram to follow reality stars is a post-Kardashian reflex for viewers on leaving the villa, winner Dani Dyer already had over 2 million fans on the platform.With the lines between reality TV and social media so blurred, it is no surprise to see programme makers cutting out the middle man. Enter The Circle, Channel 4’s new social media-fuelled reality show hosted by Alice Levine (of My Dad Wrote a Porno and Radio 1) and Maya Jama, a presenter who herself boasts nearly 700,000 Instagram followers.The show, which started on Tuesday 18 September in the UK, sees a group of wannabes move into a block of flats together in London. So far, so 2006. However, their only interactions take place via an app, where they angle for popularity with their fellow players and aim to bag a £50,000 prize. The programme makers describe it as “an exciting new online popularity contest”, although for most people it will likely be the most anxiety-inducing reality event since Tiffany Pollard thought that David Gest had died in the Big Brother house.The players rate each other – like in the Black Mirror episodes Nosee and Fifteen Million Merits – and those with the lowest ratings get binned off. Then, and only then, will they be revealed to their fellow contestants.“Viewers will get to see what really makes people popular and how far players will go to become the most influential in the game,” said Jama before the show aired, with the trailer somewhat ominously asking the audience: “What would you do to win the ‘like’ game online?”As the series kicked off, there were some big surprises, not least Genelle, who was keeping her baby a secret from her fellow contestants. There was Alex, who used his girlfriend’s photos to play as “Kate”, and the Towie-esque Freddie, a gay man pretending to be straight, who also invented a dead dog to gain the others’ sympathy.There is something intensely strange about watching these iniduals craft a version of themselves they think will be popular online, not least when Jennifer decided people would trust her more if she said she was a doctor (hopefully they won’t start asking for medical advice), and Genelle picked a profile picture she thought made her look young and flighty. At the end of the first episode, the housemates rated each other, with Jennifer’s poor chat (“I love walks!”) landing her last place and leaving her at risk of being blocked.As shallow as this all sounds, perhaps the most terrifying thing is that this is already how so many of us live our lives: swiping left on someone on Tinder because they like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, or claim to be looking for a “partner in crime”, or because their nose looks a little bit like it was damaged in some kind of sporting accident. Forming opinions on your colleague’s stepmum’s cousin after falling down an Instagram rabbithole. Unfriending. Unfollowing. Googling to see whether your driving instructor from six years ago can see that you’ve blocked them on WhatsApp.Surely, then, The Circle is merely putting a mirror up to what we already have and showing us the flaws within in. That isn’t limited to vapidity, either: the players will “never really know if the information they have is the whole truth or a persona that’s been created to try and win”, meaning there is a possibility that the house’s biggest It Girl could well turn out to be a middle-aged IT consultant called Darren, in the vein of Shakespeare or, er, MTV’s Catfish.As silly as it is, The Circle has already begun showing us the ridiculousness of online interactions: by the end of the first episode, laddish, dick pic-sending Mitchell was eating virtual profiteroles with “Kate”, the most popular person in the group, while alter-ego Alex sat on the other side of a wall holding in his laughter. Elsewhere, Freddie was relishing the chance to invert stereotypes and prejudice as he flirted with the girls (who presumably couldn’t hear him screaming to himself with glee in his apartment).Maybe, then, The Circle will prove to be an intelligent take on these confusing times, shining a light on the lengths we are willing to go to to be validated, and the snap judgments we make about others. Or, perhaps it will merely reinforce the sense that reality TV and social media are worthy of our attention and energy. In any case, surely it is not merely the people on the show but those commentating from outside who will be hoping for victory in this “‘likes’ game”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f55d3da2540976c61e77b3b6c6021add3c3bce9/71_520_5799_3480/master/5799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49a534f4509d93d40770943ef81d969f","title":"surprise truce brokered by turkey and russia spares idlib for now","story":"Surprise initiative welcome respite for Syrian opposition and people of the provinceRelieved locals and rebel groups in Idlib have been trying to unpick details of an eleventh-hour truce that excludes much of the northern Syrian province from a Russian-led attack for at least one month and sets up a buffer zone intended to shield 3 million civilians.The surprise initiative, brokered by Turkey and Russia on Monday, assuages fears of an immediate widespread humanitarian catastrophe and sets the scene for a swathe of northern Syria to remain out of central government control indefinitely.The arrangement strengthens the role of Turkish-backed rebels in the northern province, and is likely to lead hardline groups to make a tactical retreat to southern Idlib where, for now, they will remain out of the sights of Russian and Syrian guns.The move is a welcome respite for Syrian opposition groups, who had feared a massive attack aimed at returning the final rebel-held province to central government control, allowing Bashar al-Assad to clinch victory in the seven-year war.As momentum built towards an attack, Assad’s backers, Russia and Iran, grew increasingly wary of the political price they would end up paying by bringing about a humanitarian crisis unlike any other in the Syrian war.Weeks of belligerent rhetoric from Tehran and Moscow had increasingly softened in recent days and been replaced by common ground with Ankara – a central backer of what remains of the anti-Assad opposition, which has increasingly muscled in on northern Syria and saw its own interests unravelling if chaos was ignited along its border.“Civilians in Idlib think this is a good deal, they feel hopeful and happy concerning it,” said Mahmoud Abbi, a spokesperson for Free Idlib Police, a rebel-backed local police force. “We are grateful for Turkey’s efforts to prevent the Russian and Assad attack on Idlib. However … we do not trust Russia about the deal. But for now it is better than displacement or bombing.“The deal is for Turkey’s security but it is also face-saving for Putin and by association Assad,” he said. “Iran refused to participate in this attack because of its own bad military and economic situation. The Assad regime is weak and has no ability to attack without the help of Iranian militias.”The Assad regime was not represented at the bilateral summit between Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the Russian resort town of Sochi, and not was it present at a trilateral summit with Iran in Tehran one week ago. The Syrian government had no immediate response to the development, which appears likely to consolidate Turkey’s presence in the north, giving Erdogan a stronger hand in managing the final stages of the war – and aftermath.Central to the truce is the removal of an extremist coalition from the buffer zone, the dimensions of which are yet to be finalised. Turkish and Russian intelligence officials will soon meet to thrash out the numbers of radical rebels required to leave the province. The agreement suggests that those who agree to exit will be given safe passage to the eastern Hama desert region.Jawad Abdel Karim, 40, a spokesman for the Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) umbrella group of hardline fighters, said his organisation is, for now, expected to retreat up to 7km (4.3 miles) away from the agreed demarcation point. Forces loyal to the Assad regime, meanwhile, would retreat 10km away. “Give or take, the distance between the opposition and regime will be 15km,” he said.The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammed Zarif, said he welcomed the apparent breakthrough, adding weight to a growing belief that the deal, or a variation of it, would hold. “Intensive responsible diplomacy over the last few weeks-pursued in my visits to Ankara and Damascus, followed by the Iran-Russia-Turkey Summit in Tehran and the meeting in Sochi-is succeeding to avert war in Idlib with a firm commitment to fight extremist terror. Diplomacy works,” Zarif wrote on Twitter.HTS, and earlier incarnations of it, has been a significant presence throughout Idlib for the past three years. It has been particularly strong in the south, but has attempted to impose austere theocratic rule in many towns and cities. The numbers of ideologically driven fighters in its ranks have been difficult to gauge. Thousands of men had joined the organisation because of its strength. But as its momentum wanes, the powerful group is starting to lose impetus in some parts of Idlib.While parts of Idlib appeared to rally behind the truce, not all were convinced that it would hold. “Although we agree with the points mentioned in the agreement between Erdoğan and Putin, have they ever got a result before?” asked Abu Wissam, 32. “Civilians on the ground are still living in fear and worry. We’re all hesitant and we’re all doubtful. And we have nothing to say any more. Our voices went hoarse with demands and no one listened.”Another Idlib local, Ahmed Hallaq, 34, said: We had bigger dreams and goals than this agreement. All of Syria should have been safe from the Assad regime and his militias, not just a buffer zone. Lots of my friends around here think the same. We don’t trust the regime, we have zero trust in its morals and promises. They violated most, if not everything else that’s been agreed on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24ec87de30c94e2524ce58697fbb4daab16ab32e/0_189_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e78a5fea6a871d6f0d6c92925d831ed4","title":"north korea shut missile test summit kim jong un moon","story":"Moon Jae-in says leaders have agreed to steps they say will lead to a nuclear-free peninsula, and Kim pledges to visit SeoulNorth Korea will shut down key missile test facilities in the presence of “international experts” and is willing to close its only known nuclear complex if the United States makes reciprocal measures, South Korean president Moon Jae-in has announced in a joint press conference with Kim Jong-un.The two leaders also agreed during a three-day summit in Pyongyang to connect two rail lines, on the east and west side of the peninsula, across one of the most militarised borders in the world. Kim also said he would visit Seoul in the “near future”, a move that would make him the first North Korean leader to visit the South’s capital.North and South Korea agreed that the Korean Peninsula should turn into a “land of peace without nuclear weapons and nuclear threats”, Moon said. Any transport links would require the approval of the US-led United Nations Command, which oversees the border region.“There is not only going to be a smooth road ahead, there will be challenges and trials, but the more we overcome them the stronger we will become,” Kim said. “We are not afraid of future challenges.”The agreement signed in Pyongyang “will open a higher level for the improvement in relations” between the two Koreas, Kim added, describing it as a “leap forward” toward peace.Donald Trump described the meeting as “Very exciting!” in a tweet, and claimed Kim had “agreed to allow nuclear inspections, subject to final negotiations”.Under the agreement signed by the men, North Korea will shut down the Dongchang-ri missile engine testing facility and missile launch pad, according to Moon. It was not immediately clear what North Korea meant by “reciprocal measures” the US could take so that it would shut its nuclear complex, but it is unlikely Washington would agree to give up any part of its own nuclear arsenal.Kim did not mention denuclearisation at any point in his own remarks. The lack of steps specifically on the nuclear issue could worry officials in Washington, and talks between the US and North Korea have stalled in recent weeks. Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who focused on North Korea policy, said: “I think we can expect a two-tiered response where President Trump remains enthusiastic about engaging with Kim Jong-un, but we also see continued scepticism from US officials about both the purported progress on denuclearisation.“But if one thing is clear, it’s that North Korea continues to outmanoeuvre the United States through its willingness to take initiatives that shape the global public narrative and force Washington to choose between engaging on Pyongyang’s terms or looking like it is acting in bad faith.”The two Koreas also agreed to establish a joint military committee to resolve any potential conflicts, and each side will withdrawal 11 guard post from the demilitarised zone by the end of the year. The two militaries agreed to a range of measured to prevent accidental clashes, including a no-fly zone near the border and suspending test firing in the area.South Korea will allow its citizens to visit the Mount Kumgang tourist region in the North for the first time since 2008, when a North Korean soldier shot and killed a tourist from the South.

The language barrier, the fact that most of Romanian citizens don’t follow UK media at all, makes them quite vulnerable,” says Florina Tudose, an outreach worker with the East European Resource Centre, which has repeatedly raised concerns with the Home Office.“From our field research and extensive outreach within the Romanian community, we’ve noticed that many Romanians think that the settled status will be an automatic process, that as long as they pay taxes and are law-abiding citizens, everything is going to be OK,” she says. accompanied Tudose to meet some of the Romanians in communities in two areas of north London and found these fears were borne out.One woman, in her 40s, in a Romanian butcher’s shop explained she had no worries about Brexit.“I lived in Italy for 17 years, I didn’t know if I was illegal, nobody cared, I wasn’t stopped once, why should it be any different here?,” she says.Others wrongly believed the Home Office knew who they were and, as long as they paid taxes, registration would be automatic.“They will send us letters,” one 20-something shop assistant tells Tudose. “I am not worried at all about Brexit, why should I be? I’ve been here nine years and pay taxes and they will see that,” she says, betraying an alarming lack of knowledge about the Home Office plans or the consequences of not registering, which could include deportation or denial of re-entry into the country after a holiday.“Sadly,” says Tudose, “You hear this a lot. How are the Home Office going to get to these people? This is why we are worried.”A closer look at the Romanians interviewed by the  reveal that all have come to Britain to better their lives, not to take benefits.Several parents tell heartbreaking stories about leaving children behind with grandparents, so desperate have they been to provide for their families.Others complained that British people were ignorant about Romania and Romanians, with one protesting: “if Romania is as bad as the British think why has Prince Charles bought so much property there?”“What will England do without us?” says Dragoș, who works in a Romanian restaurant in Dollis Hill, north London, an area popular with Romanians.He was lured to the UK from Germany by a large nursing home group in November 2016.“It wasn’t fair. Last year in November, December, during the bad weather, they all called in to say they couldn’t come in. There was only two centimetres of snow. I had to take my car and personally pick up other Romanians. We couldn’t not go to work. These are elderly people, some have dementia, in my country you are one with the elderly, you have responsibilities and you get that drummed into you. Our work ethic and sense of responsibility is higher than it is here.”Asked what he thinks the British think about Romanians, Dragoș says elliptically. “Every shepherd has its black sheep, so do countries.” He is referring to the “criminals” in his community, who he says give “Romanians a bad name”.He shows me videos of fancy cars and lavish mansions in his town Țăndărei, known as the “Beverley Hills for Romanian gangsters”. It is a narrative that fits well with Brexiters and one that is often heard in the Romanian community, says Tudose.Dragoș, like others, sees himself as a highly mobile worker feeding his family back home where his wife and seven-year-old daughter still live.“We don’t have any future in Romania because of the corruption,” he says.Over the past 20 years Dragoș has lived in Greece, Cyprus, Belgium, Holland, Malta, Italy and Germany. He speaks five languages and thinks Britain would “be in trouble” if it pulled up the drawbridge to EU citizens.“Where will they get the women for all the low-skilled jobs?” If we go home, who is going to do the jobs? It is a bit racist, but it is their own decision. We are all here to work, we pay taxes, to pay rent, we pay insurance, buy food, pay bank fees. There will be a price to pay.”Hannah, who declined to be photographed or named, has been in Britain for two years and she is considering going home as she has only one friend in London.She typifies the type of hard unsung work that is done on a daily basis by EU workers, mainly east European, to keep the shelves full in supermarkets, the rooms clean in hotels and the streets free of rubbish.She worked for 18 months in Aldi in Swindon shifting crates of chilled food.Hannah says: “The job was terrible. It was very hard work, in a warehouse kept at between zero and two degrees. You had to work very hard every day, must pick up 2,000 boxes, boxes of milk, pizza, cooked meats, juice, yoghurt.“I had a target per hour to pick up 300 cases, if you do not make that target you go home.“You were put on trial for three months and if you didn’t make the 300 crates per hour every day you didn’t get a job. I was determined to get the job so I picked up 400 crates an hour, more than I needed.”In her 18 months in the warehouse she says there was just one British worker. “He lasted three days.”She hated the job she says and she was lonely, but she did it for the money, £12 an hour.In a good week she could make close to £500, more than the monthly wage in Romania but the tyranny of poor employment options made it impossible to leave.“It was a good rate, but one day I looked at myself in the safety shoes, gloves and hi-vis jacket and thought: I’m a healthy bright woman I can’t believe I am doing this.” She thought of going into cleaning, but then realised at £7 an hour “it wasn’t much”.Roxy, as she is known, with a masters degree in agricultural engineering under her belt, first came to Britain for adventure. She has been working on the harvests in a berry farm in Kent since 2010. She didn’t intend to stay, but like many EU citizens in Britain, has settled here.She is earning good money compared with what she could make back home, but she’s fed up with the way Romanians are treated, not on the farm, but by the wider community and is unsure of her future here.She says: “I am happy here, I just don’t like it when people say: ‘You are Romanian, you come here just to take our jobs, you are gypsies, you take benefits’.“I have not taken £1 here without working for it. Any English person who comes here and asks for a job at the farm, will get a job with open arms, but they are not coming and still people in this country say we are stealing their jobs.”Was she surprised by the vote to leave the EU?“No,” she says, “because you can see it on people’s faces. They hate us. In the supermarket you see how they look at you when they hear you speak Romanian, it’s better just to shut up. They do not like us.”Roxy says she has not experienced racism and stresses that her employers and all the English people on the farm “treat everyone equally”. The raspberry and soft fruit farm’s owner has frequently expressed fears that he will not be able to recruit staff after Brexit.But she says the perception of Romanians in Britain is otherwise ugly.“British people say they are not racist, but they think we are here as slaves just because we do this work and then they treat us like that. I don’t speak for me or mean the farm, but the general people.”She says fewer Romanians are now coming to Britain as word has got back that it is not all a bed of roses for agricultural workers, despite the lure of good money.Roxy, who is a team leader in the Kent berry farm, says she needs 20 more people to cope with this year’s crop “but they don’t come here” – British or eastern Europeans. “They don’t like the rain, the mud, the hard work”.“If they want to come here to work hard, yes, they should come. But if they want to come here because of some romantic dream, no, it is hard, it is not easy, you’re not in your own country, British people are grumpy and cold towards you.”Roxy arrived in the UK after the principle agricultural recruitment agency Concordia, offered her a job after she graduated with a primary degree in agronomy .At the time a first job in Romania would have earned her £300 a month and with the promise of the same amount a week in England, she made the journey to Kent. It was hard work, but an exciting adventure, she explains.Her day starts at 4am, when she gets up at the house she shares with her boyfriend in Sittingbourne. She is on the farm at 5.45am to lead her team of 40 through aisles and aisles of raspberry plants under polytunnels.Then have a 15-minute tea break at 8.30am and continue to 11am when they have 30 minutes for lunch with a further tea break at 1.30pm. Normally the day ends at 3pm but with so much produce, they continue for another hour during the peak harvest.By the time Roxy gets home at around 6pm she just has time to “shower, cook and eat and then go to bed around 8.30pm to 9.30pm”.Despite the gruelling hours, she appreciates her life in Britain. She says: “I would like to stay here, it’s already our home in a way, but this Brexit, we are not sure we want to make a life here.“Do we want to get a mortgage? We could get one, but next year they could say we can’t stay here, so we have no security.“Sometimes you just want to pack your bags and leave and say: ‘Okay, I’ve had enough’.”It wasn’t easy for Cristina to leave Romania – she needed to make money and had to leave her daughter at home in order to make it work.“It was really hard. I didn’t know anyone here,” she says.“I didn’t know much about Britain. I knew something about the Queen, I knew it was expensive, but that I would earn more money here.“Then when I got here I realised it was not so easy to save.”When asked if the savings are for her daughter, Cristina begins to cry. “It is very hard to be here without her. I need the money for her school. It is a very sensitive subject. It is a big sacrifice.“It is why I am here to pay for my daughter to have private music, to learn foreign languages, she’s also learning taekwondo.“If I wasn’t here she would have none of these things. I am doing this for her. I would like her to come here but because of Brexit I cannot be certain. She is in primary school now. I’m not going to bring her here and then we find out we have to leave,” she says.Life is still hard for Cristina, but better than back home, she believes.She lives in a shared house with six people, each in a room of their own.Living on the outskirts of London costs £600 a month in rent and she hardly ever goes out to socialise or see the sights in the capital as she works from 7am to 7pm six days a week.“I see this as a time in my life I have to make sacrifices,” she says.Moving back to Bucharest wouldn’t make economic sense. She would have to pay £400 a month in rent and would never earn enough money for her daughter and 72-year-old dad, who is on a pension of €200 (£180) a month.“He couldn’t survive without my money,” she says.Does Brexit make her feel unsettled? “It depends on whether I can work any more, but I’m not scared about it.”She hasn’t heard of “settled status” immigration ID, which would be mandatory under current proposals for all EU citizens, bar the Irish, from summer 2021.“Everyone is very confused. I think that’s because of the people in charge,” she suggests.Cristina doesn’t read Romanian or British newspapers or media, where Brexit is headline news every day, because it makes her “anxious”.When Tudose explains what settled status is she says she is willing to apply for it but predicts there is going to be a lot of fraud, people looking to borrow passports and national insurance numbers to get the new identity.Ultimately she hopes to return home, but for now her daughter and father need her wages in London.Sebi, as he is known, has just arrived in London to work in a Romanian butcher’s shop in Burnt Oak. He stands at the counter, while his boss is telling the East European Resource Centre about hate crime that morning when two women shouted at them “to go home” in the lane beside his shop.Sebi, like Cristina, came to Britain to give his child, a 13-year-old-boy, a better life.“I want to secure a future for him, to send him to university.”He is from Botoșani, the poorest part of Romania, and the lack of work prompted him to leave years ago.He has worked on markets selling vegetables all his life, but in Romania he was earning just £8 a day “and that would be on a good day”, Sebi says.He adds: “I lived in a village outside the town with my son and parents and would have to pay for the bus out of that as well as buy utilities, food and clothes.”In London he hopes to earn around £1,200 a month, of which £300 is committed to a single room in a house share, gas and electricity on top of that would still leave him with enough to repatriate, if he does not spend money on going out.He is now on a trial work period at the shop but is full of hope for what he can earn his family. “I am willing to work hard. I want to stay 20 years here until my retirement.”Like Cristina, he tends to stay in the area and has seen none of the treasures of London’s museums and galleries, restaurants and shops, or the capital’s nightlife.“I am afraid to spend money right now,” he says.He hadn’t heard of Brexit and it was a friend who hooked him up with the Burnt Oak job.If he wasn’t in London, he would be somewhere else in Europe earning for his parents and son. He spent a year in Turkey and two years working in a market in Poland.Brexit has changed everything for east Europeans, says Cristina.“When I came to the country, everybody spoke normally to you. There was no big difference if you had papers or not. People just treated you as people and liked immigrants. We worked hard and cleaned properly. British people didn’t know how to clean.“Now, 18 years on and we have all the rights to work, people treat you like an animal,” she says.But she says British people have never tried to understand Romania.“Somebody asked me a few years ago: ‘Did we have TV in Romania?’ I asked them do they own two properties. If Romania is so bad why does Prince Charles love it so much?” she says, quickly doing a Google search on her phone to show his health retreat in the bucolic Transylvania.Cristina says she has not been subjected to racial abuse, but her friends have, particularly those living outside London. “The day after the referendum, they said people said they didn’t want to serve us.”She thinks that many Romanians have returned home because London is now so expensive to rent and because of the uncertainty of Brexit.Christina says: “Now everyone is so scared. People from Bulgaria, Ukraine, Lithuania, Poland, because they do not know what is going to happen.“I tell people it will be okay and they say: ‘No, you need permanent residency, you could be stopped, you could be deported.’”She managed chambermaids for three years in the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch, London, and then in a rubber factory in Doncaster where she was paid £10 an hour.Christina, who is from the city of Târgoviște, came into the country with a sports team in 2001 on a 15-day tourist visa and went on to spend most of her life in the UK in cleaning jobs, working in hotels as well as jobs in coffee chains.“The standard of cleaning by British workers was so bad,” she says in reference to one hotel in Stansted where she worked. “The floor manager was English and she didn’t care about the standard of cleaning.” Romanians care and make people come back to clean properly if rooms are not done right.”Like many Romanians interviewed by the , Cristina left her child behind to come to Britain to make a better life for her son. She was here for two-and-a-half years before he could join her.“It was so hard to leave him. I didn’t want to do it. I had days when I just did my job and I would cry all day,” she says.But she was determined she wanted her son to have something better and after a stint in London went to Barcelona, Spain, and then they went back to Romania in 2009 and opened some food shops.A year later they returned to London to run a restaurant in Dollis Hill with her husband and her two children.She has not heard of the settled status scheme that the Home Office was about to launch, but says London is where she intends to stay while her younger child remains in school.“I don’t have an option. We are going to Romania on holiday, my son says: ‘Mum, when are we going to go home?’”Ovidiu is said to be one of the best known Romanians in the community in Britain, having lived in the country for nearly 40 years. He risked his life to escape the terrors of Romania’s communist dictatorship in 1979.He speaks seven languages, has a thriving bakery business in north London and was once a partner in a chain of pizzerias.But his arrival on a boat from eastern Europe was pure fluke.His wife had died in an accident leaving him with five small children, the youngest just six months old, to bring up on his own. After six years as a widow, and with the Ceaușescu regime in its first flushes of dictatorship, he decided his best chance was to leave the country be secreting himself on a ship heading to Freiberg in Germany, where he had some friends.“The truth is 1979-1980 were really hard,” he says.While on board, the ship was rechartered and he ended up in Turkey and then – by chance – in Kent, having lost half his body weight as a stowaway.“It was a huge risk. We had political prisons. You could have been sentenced to 15 years in a labour camp or disappeared.”He went straight to Amnesty and after three weeks he got a job in the Basel St Hotel behind Harrods in London, giving him a start in the hospitality trade that was to last decades.As for Brexit, he says: “I don’t know if the government is prepared. Romanians work everywhere, in hospitals, coffee shops, garbage, they work in Asda, Iceland, some are in good positions, working in management, in homes for the elderly. The English aren’t going to take those jobs. They won’t do the shit jobs.”“I think Brexit is done to get rid of all the people on benefits,” he adds, and goes on to complains about fellow Romanians who come to the UK to take advantage – as he sees it – of the British system. “I have five children and am a single parent but I did not take any benefit for all that time. People can be entitled to benefits but the English government doesn’t check.”Theology postgraduate Cătălin has been in the UK on and off since 2006, initially on a seasonal agriculture workers’ scheme which allowed temporary immigration from Bulgaria and Romania ahead of full accession to the EU.He and his wife are now British citizens and will be here at least until they retire.Cătălin believes the UK seasonal work is less attractive, largely because the pound is so weak. In 2006 the pound would buy €1.46. Now it will buy just €1.12 and the price of accommodation and food has gone up.But the big appeal for Cătălin was a career. He progressed from picker, to supervisor, to team leader to line manager and is now a farm manager, running a £7m turnover section of the berry fields where he manages a team of 260 people.He is from a middle-class family who could afford to send their son to university, but Cătălin says such a career trajectory would not have existed at home. “Here I could build a career on my own steam. In Romania you need to know someone to help you. You would never have become a farm manager in 12 years,” he says.From the beginning the money was relatively attractive with wages of £350-£380 a week on the fruit farm in Herefordshire compared with the £200 a month on offer in Romania.“With the money I was able to buy land in Romania, plant cherry trees, renovate my father’s house, buy new furniture and put in central heating,” he says.“When I think of Britain then, the prices of food and fuel were lower, you could buy a lot more and save a lot more. There was never any racism towards us.”Cătălin thought he would eventually go home but a growing family and a good career made him rethink his plans, and he became a British citizen – an expensive insurance policy he took out against Brexit.He paid £1,273 for each application, plus £150 each for the English test and £50 each for the life in the UK test. Not a trifling figure. “I was quite stressed about it, I took it very seriously,” he says. “It was a lot of money. I paid taxes for 12 years and just to secure my future I had to pay that.”He works hard but he likes his life in a quite village in the West Country. “It’s clean, there are plenty of green areas and parks and we have friends in towns around here.”Many Romanians are returning: Cătălin has a friend who runs a haulage company which cannot hire drivers and the economy back home is getting stronger. But he thinks Romanians will continue to migrate throughout Europe for years to come."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3633539.1537290925!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"deal or no deal the countdown to brexit starts here","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and (in background) the UK’s Brexit minister Dominic Raab. Photograph: Eric VidalFile PhotoReutersNegotiators, officials, advisers and politicians, in Brussels, London and Dublin are bracing themselves for an intensification of activity over the coming weeks as the decisive phase of the Brexit talks approaches.Will there be a backstop, guaranteeing an invisible border? Will there be a withdrawal agreement? Or will the two sides fail to strike an agreement, resulting in a crash-out Brexit next March – and all the disruption, uncertainty and economic damage this outcome would entail?The two sides remain deadlocked on the backstop – the guarantee that there will be no hard border in Ireland – even if there is no agreement between the UK and the EU on a future trade deal. This outcome was promised by both sides in principle in a joint declaration at last December’s summit. But there has been no agreement on how it would be achieved.The EU has suggested that it could be achieved by essentially keeping the North in the single market and customs union after Brexit. This has been rejected by the British on the basis that treating the North differently to the rest of the UK would undermine the UK’s single market and even its constitutional integrity. Instead the UK suggested that a promise to keep the entire UK in the single market and customs union for goods only – and for a limited time – would work as a backstop instead. But this was rejected by the EU as a form of “cherrypicking” – taking the bits of EU membership that the UK likes, but opting out of the bits it doesn’t. And that is not acceptable to the EU.Yesterday British newspapers quoted Brussels sources as saying they believed the British government would have to be faced with the immediate prospect of a no-deal Brexit before they stepped back from their position on the Irish backstop.But senior figures in Dublin believe it is in just these circumstances that the EU side will relent.But sources in London believe the British should keep the border issue alive for as long as possible – including into the intended next phase of the negotiations on the future relationship, where they can use it as leverage in the horse-trading that will dominate the talks on a trade deal.Given all that, the potential for a stand-off in the talks in the coming months is evident. So how does the clock tick down towards midnight?The countdown begins in earnest when European leaders meet for an “informal” summit hosted by the Austrian presidency in Salzburg. However, British hopes that the meeting would signal a shift in the EU’s approach are likely to be dashed. As an informal meeting, there are no written conclusions from the summit, so any change in the negotiating mandate for Michel Barnier is impossible. EU leaders are expected to give encouraging signs about the Chequers proposal, but to reiterate their position about no cherrypicking and the backstop.All eyes will switch to the UK, where the Labour Party meets for its conference in Liverpool and the Conservatives meet in Birmingham. Prime minister Theresa May is expected to stick doggedly to her Chequers plan in the face of fierce criticism – and constant talk of a leadership challenge – from Brexiteers in her party. Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, will face pressure to commit to a second referendum, while Labour’s position that it will vote against a withdrawal treaty based on the Chequers plan (itself a long shot) is also likely to be challenged by its own ranks.The official – albeit self-imposed – deadline for the withdrawal agreement, and the political declaration on the future relationship to be reached is at the October European Council summit in Brussels. But while October is likely to see frantic work by the negotiating teams, few people on either side believe a deal is likely by the summit. Conclusions are agreed and circulated for approval a few days in advance of the summit, shortening the deadline by another couple of days. However, the October summit may well signal whether an agreement is possible at all. Any change in the EU’s position would have to agreed by leaders at the summit if there is no movement by either side, leaders are likely to emerge with the prospect of a hard Brexit looming much larger.EU sources say that a special Brexit summit, likely to be scheduled for mid-November, is likely if the two sides believe after the October summit that a deal is likely. Under article 50, the terms of the withdrawal treaty must be agreed by EU leaders – strictly speaking, formal unanimity is not required, but in practice the European Council operates by consensus, especially on such significant issues. But the summit would only be scheduled if agreement was more or less certain – and this will depend on the progress in negotiations after the October summit.This is the final European summit of the year in Brussels, and is the last practical date for an agreement to be reached. The withdrawal treaty would have to be ratified by both Westminster and the European Parliament before the end of March, and both could be time-consuming procedures. If there is no agreement by December, then a crash-out Brexit in March will loom, though diplomatic activity is likely to switch to examining the possibility of an extension to article 50, moving the deadline back. But the diplomatic and political damage caused by the failure to reach and agreement would seriously hinder that possibility.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe  It wasn’t so much a speech as a performance.“Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,” cried Michael D, galloping back to battle with a small pair of scissors, a length of green ribbon and an extravagant sweep of the arm.Those weren’t the actual words spoken by the President – but it’s the essence of what he said during a rousing 20-minute speech on the ploughing fields of Screggan.There was no time for subtlety in his soliloquy, for not only was he officially opening the National Ploughing Championships, he was also unofficially opening his campaign to win a second term as president of Ireland.Seven years a slave to constitutional constraint can be difficult for any occupant of Áras an Uachtaráin, but it must place a particular strain on somebody like Michael D Higgins, who was always very partial to a blistering political argument.So when he made this latest trip to open the largest outdoor event in Europe this year, he had much more to do than merely cut a ribbon and utter some stirring words about our deep-rooted connection to the land.Michael D was a man on a mission, at the start of a mission.He is not yet officially off the leash, but you wouldn’t have known that on Tuesday. President Higgins was only short of dancing up to the microphone when called upon to speak.“May I say what a great pleasure it is to be here again at . . . the Ploughing!” And with that, he was off, chewing the scenery with quivering gusto, waving around the fistful of papers he would have been consulting had he not sashayed off script within minutes.There was hardly need for amplification as he held forth like a veteran thespian declaiming to the audience at the back of the theatre, only he was standing in the middle of a field, and the back of the house was the Slieve Bloom Mountains.There were extravagant sweeps of the arm and, at one stage, a hand held high in the air like Jim Larkin’s statue in O’Connell Street. Which is fair enough, as big Jim and the 1913 lockout was mentioned in the course of the speech, after which the President launched himself into a simmering throng of admirers in front of the stage.Also mentioned was the 19th-century writer and revolutionary James Fintan Lalor who spoke of the right of the people to live on the land in security, comfort and independence.“We remember him as well as all of the others we paid tribute to over the last few years: Tone and Pearse and Connolly and others,” carolled Michael D, before reflecting on the next period of national commemoration to come next year when “we’ll be celebrating the first Dáil with all its great promise”.A reminder stitched in there for potential voters of how, as President, he presided over the delicate 1916 centenary commemorations.He spoke of the importance of the ploughing festival, which “invites all of the people of Ireland to realise the importance of farming as a way of life and of the importance of sustaining it and addressing its issues in a practical way”.As President Higgins spoke, one of his rivals for the job, Seán Gallagher, stood to one side of the platform, also facing the crowd.The man who came second in the election seven years ago was one of two former Dragons’ Den participants who were also on the Áras trail in the sprawling Screggan grounds.It was a bold move by the candidate, who pressed the flesh and made himself very visible in the vicinity of the President. At midday, when Michael D eventually made it through a crush of well-wishers to the stage, Seán had already strategically positioned himself at the foot of the steps. The President would have to pass by him, but so too did a battalion of men in green IFA blazers augmented by a few more wearing chains of office. They blocked the view. Gallagher moved forward, to no avail. Snubbed?But no. Somebody must have whispered something to Michael D because he turned and belted his way past the blocking blazers and warmly greeted the businessman, thanking him for a note he had sent to him.“So, I’ll see you shortly,” said Seán.“Oh, you will,” replied President Higgins, loudly.He told reporters he will begin his campaign in about a week’s time.“I’ve never run away from a campaign in my life, for goodness sake,” he declared, adding that he had been fighting them for nearly 40 years.Whatever happens, he hoped the campaign would be dignified and about “the real issues”.It was a difficult beat for the three declared candidates who were in Laois for the first day of the championships. Joan Freeman, Gallagher and Gavin Duffy strolled around the stands and exhibitions, doing their best to meet as many people as possible. Duffy’s small team had a big roll of stickers which they tried to hand out to passing children.He was with his wife Orlaith, and they wore matching wellies. Lovely expensive Dubarry boots which were admired by many.They did interviews and did their best to explain how it’s early days and the opinion polls putting Higgins miles ahead are not indicative of how the situation could change as the campaign progresses. Gallagher and Duffy, while expressing undying admiration for the incumbent, stressed the need for him to participate fully in any TV debates.Michael D, for his part, was letting it be known that he is up for the fight. He spent the day visiting stands while his security details, gardaí and a private security firm hired by the National Ploughing Association kept the crowds at bay as best they could. The President was mobbed.Not a good thing for the candidates to see. Screggan belonged to President Higgins. He was the star of the show on Tuesday. They will have to engage on different fronts if they are to peg back his lead. They will. They have to.The only VIP who got a very positive reception and a surprisingly high recognition rate from the crowd was the new Garda Commissioner Drew Harris. He was the recipient of good wishes from many people as he got his first experience of the ploughing.As the afternoon wore on, news came through that a third “dragon” had made the ballot sheet. Peter Casey is the latest alumnus of the business themed entertainment programme to join the chasing pack.What should they be called: A showboat of Dragons? A bluster? A congratulation?Michael D worked his way though a large number of stands. Loving it. He met Jessica McGrath from Monkstown in Dublin who told him her grandmother Maureen Sheehan was delighted to received her 100th birthday cheque from him last Wednesday.Meanwhile, Marie Finneran from Laois managed to get the President to sign a hurley for her son Luka (12), who plays for Four Roads.“It’ll be used in the under-12 county final on Saturday against St Dominick’s,” said Marie.The campaign is under way in earnest.Oh, yes he has.This is going to be fun."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3633648.1537302891!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pac to decide whether to investigate president s spending","story":"Speaking at the 87th Ploughing Championships in Tullamore, Co Offaly, President Michael D Higgins says he hopes the presidential race is dignified and about real issues.

The issue was raised by Independent Senator Gerard Craughwell who said he had received information during the summer that Mr Higgins stayed at the hotel, where top suites are advertised for €3,000 a night. Neither the Áras nor the Department of Foreign Affairs would confirm if Mr Higgins stayed at the Beau-Rivage, or the cost of his accommodation (if any) during his visit. Chairman Sean Fleming confirmed the committee had since then received several requests to examine the allocated finances to the President’s office to determine if there was value for money. The issue will be discussed at the PAC meeting on Thursday. If the committee does decide to examine the President’s spending, the hearing will have to be held next Tuesday. Mr Fleming thinks that if it takes place after Wednesday, September 26th, (when the presidential election campaign has started) it could be seen as political interference. The accounting officer for the President’s office is the Secretary General to the Government, Martin Fraser, who would be required to appear before the committee. Details of spending of the President’s office, including for hotel accommodation, flights and foreign trips, are not ulged to the public.The office is exempt from Freedom of Information requests. However, all foreign trips, including the size of delegations and costs, require the approval of the Government. The overall budget for the President’s office has not changed markedly since Mr Higgins replaced Mary McAleese. Some €1.4 million of its €4.3 million budget is allotted to a financial reward for citizens who reach 100 years of age. Of the remaining €3 million, €1.8 million is allowed for salaries €310,000 is allotted to travel and €340,000 to training and incidental expenses. Mr Higgins took a reduction in salary of €70,000 from Mrs McAleese, and is paid some €250,000 a year. He also gave up his Dáil and ministerial pensions worth €93,000 a year during his time in the Áras.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3634169.1537340610!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"moment of truth barnier rebuffs uk calls to change border stance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier (right) speaks with Simon Coveney in Brussels on Tuesday. Photograph: Olivier HosletEPAEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has rebuffed British calls for the European Union to change its stance on the contested issue of the Irish Border, and said a “moment of truth” was fast approaching on a Brexit deal.Mr Barnier said the bloc was ready “to improve” its proposal on avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, but stopped short of accepting British ideas for compromise, after the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, called on the EU to show flexibility.“The European Council in October will be the moment of truth, it is the moment when we shall see if we have an agreement,” Mr Barnier said.The Irish Border has emerged as the biggest stumbling block to the Brexit deal that British prime minister Theresa May hopes to strike with the EU this autumn. While the EU and UK have agreed there should be no hard border to prevent any return to violence, they are deadlocked over how to manage what will become a 499km (310-mile) frontier between the UK and EU.Both sides have proposed fallback plans, known as backstops, that would kick into place if trade talks fail to settle the question. The EU’s involves Northern Ireland following EU law on customs and goods, a plan Ms May has said no British prime minister could ever accept.Mr Barnier said the EU was working to improve its proposal, adding that the problem had been caused by “the UK’s decision to leave the EU, its single market and the customs union”. Seeking to counter British criticism that the EU plan eroded UK sovereignty, he said: “What we talking about here is not a land border, not a sea border, it is a set of technical checks and controls. We respect the territorial integrity of the UK and we respect the conditional order of the UK.”Mr Barnier was speaking after a 90-minute meeting with the EU’s 27 European affairs ministers at a summit in Brussels. Many countries intervened in the debate to stress the importance of reaching a deal and its timing.Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney got a full update from Mr Barnier on the backstop developments and later described his meeting as “excellent”. The Cabinet earlier agreed to hire 451 new staff for border duties out of a total of 1,077 needed for ports and airports.The Republic is among several EU countries concerned that having an emergency summit in November will take the pressure off the British in the coming weeks.Ms May will appeal to EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg to soften their stance over UK access to the single market and customs union. She is expected to tell them on Wednesday night that Brussels needs to shift. A senior Number 10 official said: “To come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same.”Downing Street believes that the UK has developed its negotiating position to reach the Chequers plan and it is now time for other EU countries to show some flexibility in order to finally strike a deal. The prime minister will argue that with “goodwill and determination” the UK and the EU could avoid a “disorderly” Brexit that would be damaging for both sides and instead strike a deal that benefited both.“Neither side can demand the ‘unacceptable’ of the other, such as an external customs border between different parts of the United Kingdom. No other country would accept it if they were in the same situation,” she will say.Ms May will tell her fellow leaders that the EU’s current proposal does not respect the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK as it effectively suggests a customs border down the Irish sea with its backstop plan.She is expected to deny suggestions by EU officials that the UK is attempting to cherry-pick by seeking the rights of membership without the obligations.“That is not what we are doing,” she will say. “What we are proposing is a fair arrangement that will work for the EU’s economy as well as the UK’s, without undermining the single market.”Number 10 has been cautiously optimistic in recent days that the UK can expect a softening of tone at the Salzburg summit from some EU leaders who are keen to nail down a Brexit deal this autumn.It remains to be seen whether that translates into a shift in negotiating position from Brussels, where officials have been more sceptical. The EU27 will wait to discuss next steps, including whether to relax Mr Barnier’s negotiating mandate, until Ms May has left the room.– ServiceDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Only Latvia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic had job satisfaction as low as England, the report finds.Fifteen of the countries where reasonable comparisons can be made – which include Israel, Sweden and the US\u0026nbsp– had “much higher” teacher job satisfaction than in England.Researchers analysed data from more than 100,000 teachers who had taken part in the most recent Teaching and Learning International Survey - including nearly 2,500 teachers from England.Teacher job satisfaction in England is lower than in almost every other country where a robust comparison can be made,” the report concluded.Dr Sam Sims, who led the research at UCL IoE, called it a “wake up call”. He said: “It is not surprising that so many teachers are leaving the profession when morale is this low.”Research shows teachers become dissatisfied with work if they are not given the freedom to get on with their jobs. But teachers in England have seen a big increase in paperwork and data entry in recent years. Cutting red tape would help restore morale in the profession,” he said.Teachers were asked four questions measuring whether they enjoyed their work, whether they would recommend their job to others, whether they would like to leave their school, and their level of satisfaction with their working life. These were combined to create a single job satisfaction score.The data was collected in 2013 but the researchers said that declining rates of teacher retention since then suggest that the situation is unlikely to have improved much in recent years.Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said: “This is no surprise. Teacher workload is simply unmanageable, particularly due to the current unnecessary accountability regime in schools.\u0026nbsp“This data relates to 2013 and we know that workload and resignation rates have gone up even further since then. \u0026nbsp“Workload, low pay and a stifling and uncreative curriculum are driving many teachers out of the profession altogether. \u0026nbsp“For the sake of children’s education the Government must address these fundamental issues and make teaching a profession that people want to join and stay in.”UK news in picturesCar manufacturer BMW announced on September 18, 2018, that its Mini factory in the UK would close for its annual summer maintenance several weeks earlier than planned, starting on April 1, 2019, to avoid any disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit.It\u0027s either my deal or no deal, the Prime Minister has said to the BBC\u0027s Nick Robinson in an interview on Panorama that airs this evening.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.

This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.In fact, the same chemical pathways help regulate a range of other cell functions in the body, including hair growth.The researchers focused on a receptor called OR2AT4, which is known to be stimulated by Sandalore, and which can be found in the outer layer of hair follicles.Intriguingly, the results suggest that human hair follicles can “smell”, in the sense that they make use of ancient smell receptors to control key functions such as growth.With millions of men and women in the UK affected by hair loss, demand for a “baldness cure” is high. Despite some promising studies over the years, many do not make it beyond the confines of the research lab.According to Professor Paus, however, his latest discovery is “not far at all” from being applied in a clinical context for hair loss.“Sandalore is already offered as a cosmetic product in Italy by the company that has co-sponsored the current study,” he said.Now, the researchers have a larger scale, professionally-controlled clinical trial underway, and they expect to see results by the beginning of next year.Dr Nicola Clayton of the British Association of Dermatologists, who was not involved in the study, said: “It is a fascinating concept that the human hair follicle, as the authors put it, can “smell” by utilising an olfactory receptor.”She said the group’s data was “very exciting”, although noted that from clinical perspective she could only speculate about the extent to which such a treatment would improve outcomes for patients.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/12/16/sleep-pods.jpg","title":"sleep napping sleeponomics korea sleepology science nap pods sleeping","story":"Created with Sketch.Our technologically-fuelled\u0026nbsplives\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspexhausting us, but they are also\u0026nbspdriving the market of sleep. Jessica Brown investigates whether the commodification of sleep is just a fad, or if the booming industry really can help us get some shut-eyeClick to followThe IndependentPodtime has sold nearly 500 nap pods in 19 countries since launching eight years agoIn these wellness-obsessed times, the tried-and-tested basics of fruit, vegetables, sleep and exercise just aren’t enough anymore.From the moment we wake up and scroll through social media, we’re inundated with ads tempting us with lotions, drinks and devices that promise to make us mentally and physically healthier, many of which have questionable claims. (Detox juices and appetite-suppressing lollipops, I’m looking at you.) \u0026nbspThe latest commodity we’re being persuaded to invest in\u0026nbspis products to help us sleep, fuelled by a booming “sleeponomics”\u0026nbspindustry in a sleep-deprived South Korea. But while it may seem like we’re getting a lot less shut-eye than we used to in the UK, according to most research we’re not getting any less now than we have done in recent history. \u0026nbspIt might feel that way, since we’re\u0026nbspall a lot more anxious and stressed these days, tuned into the blue light of our devices until late at night, and in increasingly demanding jobs where we feel obliged to answer emails 247.Work has a huge role to play in how little sleep we’re getting lines are becoming blurrier between work and home, we’re travelling more and commuting further, and working more overtime –\u0026nbspthe nine\u0026nbspto five\u0026nbspjob feels like a thing of the past.But while technology and work are making us tired, they’re also driving the market for sleep. No longer will a good mattress and some chamomile tea suffice when we can cuddle up to sleep robots, use devices to measure our sleep, assess the lighting and temperature of our bedrooms, and adjust the firmness of our beds – all through an app. \u0026nbspMattresses aren’t just mattresses anymore –\u0026nbspthey’re a lifestyle, and sleep is an industry, targeting everyone from the mildly tired to the insomniacs. London’s even hosting the capital’s only sleep exhibition next month, with consultations and talks dedicated to the art of sleeping well.While some may argue it’s good to have a market for all our sleep ailments, an industry steeped in promises leaves potential for disappointment. And for an industry so lacking regulation, this potential is high. \u0026nbspDreem, a headband that promises to make you go to sleep faster, for example, states on its website it has conducted “internal research”, however, this research doesn’t seem to be published anywhere, and there’s a very slim chance that it’s peer-reviewed.As one research paper published by US-based scientists points out, the most popular consumer sleep technologies, sleep tracking apps worn on the wrist as you sleep and alarm clocks such as Sleep Cycle, may actually cause sleep disruption from noise and light pollution. “Many sleep tracking apps require user activation and device placement on the mattress to monitor sleep,” the paper states. \u0026nbspJournalist Caroline Christie describes herself as a terrible sleeper, and says she stopped using a sleep app after it started making her anxious and reminding her when she was sleep deprived. “It also made me quite competitive, wanting to make sure I kept getting the right numbers of hours,” she says. “I’ve come to accept it all comes down to routine, and doing what it takes to make you feel relaxed and able to switch off.” \u0026nbspThere’s no such thing as sleep qualification in academia. I’m talking to public health charities and bodies who give qualifications to do something about itAnother concern, the paper states, is the lack of validation studies, FDA approval, and endorsement from American Academy of Sleep Medicine-accredited sleep facilities or sleep specialists. “Practically speaking, lack of validation may be premeditated by some developers, who run the risk of their technology being debunked or labelled inferior if compared to clinical standards,” it states. \u0026nbspAnd in terms of their reliability of measuring sleep or diagnosing sleep disorders, a wrist device hardly compares to the standards of a clinical sleep evaluation\u0026nbspa process which can involve being constantly monitored by technologists, who use\u0026nbspan electrocardiogram\u0026nbspwith more than 20 sensors to record breathing, brain and heart activity over a full night.Christie says, however, that she invested in some products recently to help her sleep\u0026nbspand drown out the sounds of her flatmates –\u0026nbspand they seem to be helping. “About six months ago, I invested in a Bluetooth eye mask that helps me block out surrounding noise and light. Now, it’s part of my sleep routine and helps my body realise it’s time to sleep. It’s comforting, easy to use, and helps me disconnect and drift off.” \u0026nbspShutterstock)However, sleep expert James Wilson, who advises workplaces, sports teams and families on their sleep, describes the market for sleep as “quite superficial,” and the lack of research, he says, has led to some dodgy practices: “There’s lots of snake oil being sold, products making claims they can’t prove. Some of these products have a lot to answer for – they don’t give a solution.”Wilson argues that part of the problem is that the industry doesn’t have a professional body, and needs more science to help people like him become more credible. He spent his teens suffering with insomnia and in work to help others in similar situations, but found a lack of options down an academic route\u0026nbspand started his career working at a charity that supports families with children that have sleeping problems.“There’s no such thing as sleep qualification in academia. I’m talking to public health charities and bodies who give qualifications to do something about it, I want there to be a practical qualification,” he says.While there are tens of thousands of nutritionists in the UK, there are very few sleep experts, and Wilson argues medical professionals aren’t trained enough to properly recognise and diagnose sleep problems.“Medical students don’t have much sleep knowledge, but sleep is fundamental to life. If you had a condition that meant your body couldn’t take in nutrients, you’d be sent straight to hospital. You can go longer without food than you can with sleep.”Tomorrow\u0027s workplace: How the world will look like in 2030Inspired by Disrupt to Stabilize: How Youth are Shaping a Fractured World Inspired by Transforming Healthcare in the 4th Industrial RevolutionInspired by in Technology We Trust?Inspired by From Linear to Expotential Value ChainsInspired by the Remaking of Global FinanceInspired by WPP Best Countries Breakfast Inspired by Disrupt to Stabilize: How Youth are Shaping a Fractured World Inspired by Transforming Healthcare in the 4th Industrial RevolutionInspired by in Technology We Trust?Inspired by From Linear to Expotential Value ChainsInspired by the Remaking of Global FinanceInspired by WPP Best Countries Breakfast Steve Robinson, founder of online shop We Sell Sleep, says while its products comes from research, including the personalised, 45-page sleep report customers can get for £20, a lot also comes from common sense.\u0026nbspSome think his products, including £215 light therapy glasses and magnesium supplements, are a load of nonsense, while others, he says, swear by them – including one customer who said a sleep mist solved his sleep problems. \u0026nbspBut as the industry booms, the science, he argues, will catch up. “The core of sleep science isn’t as evolved as other areas, but people are getting more obsessed with it, and once something gets commercial, there tends to be more money available for research.”And helping the industry boom, despite evidence suggesting work is the biggest stressor keeping us awake at night, are workplaces. Nap pod manufacturer Podtime has sold nearly 500 nap pods in 19 countries since launching eight years ago, predominantly to employers including Facebook and Nestle, whom director Paul Grindrod says are slowly coming around to the idea of napping on the job. \u0026nbspBut it took a while the company didn’t sell a single pod in its first few years, and one local authority cancelled its order with Podtime on the request of its ruling authority due to the stigma attached to napping at work. “We’re gradually overcoming this resistance, as people see the benefits to productivity.There was a time when office buildings didn’t have showers, but now many do,” he says. Grindrod, who likes to read his Kindle inside the pod, says the company doesn’t hire any scientists or commission any research, and tells clients to go online to see the benefits of sleep more generally.\u0026nbspBCIT) in Vancouver, Canada (Alamy)Wilson, however, says installing nap pods is “one of the worst things you can do,” and can exacerbate insomnia. “We have two internal systems that manage sleep: light and dark, and our internal sleep pressure, which counts down to bedtime from the moment we wake up,” he says.“Naps knock bedtime back. Using a nap pod sounds like the right thing to do, and people are doing it because they don’t know any better, but it’s not right for everyone”.Wilson argues that this is why a lot of the advice on sleep isn’t relevant – because it comes down to each inidual and how they sleep best. Headlines warning us that too little sleep causes almost every health problem under the sun aren’t helpful either, he argues, because one of the biggest reasons we can’t sleep is stress.One in seven of British couples prefer to sleep in separate bedsBad night’s sleep makes you fat and weak, study showsWhat happens when you try to catch up on sleep over the weekend“Warnings about how bad sleep is killing us means we wake up stressed in the middle of the night and can’t go back to sleep. We need to get people more relaxed about sleep,” he says. While it’s a nice sentiment, the booming sleep industry is likely to keep insisting there’s a problem to solve, especially if the beauty industry and the “help”\u0026nbspit offers consumers to “fix”\u0026nbspblackheads and cellulite, is anything to go by.Robinson likens the quality of our sleep to the efforts we put into other areas of life:\u0026nbsp“You could be fanatical about it and see a big improvement, or you can make some small differences and see some improvements. It’s the same as diet and exercise, it comes with a level of discipline.”The difference is, however, being sold the idea that we can solve our sleep problems with just a bit of effort and a lot of cash is deceiving. While we can all take steps to help us, it’s unlikely that a pillow mist or 20 minutes in a nap pod at work will cure a sleep disorder, and companies telling us they can will only make us more stressed out when we’re wide awake at 4am.

Well, eight housing associations have already been given such deals, worth almost £600m and paving the way for almost 15,000 new affordable homes.“And today, I can announce that new longer-term partnerships will be opened up to the most ambitious housing associations through a ground-breaking £2bn initiative. Under the scheme, associations will be able to apply for funding stretching as far ahead as 2028-29 – the first time any government has offered housing associations such long-term certainty.“Doing so will give you the stability you need to get tens of thousands of affordable and social homes built where they are needed most, and make it easier for you to leverage the private finance you need to build many more.”Ms May demanded associations achieve things neither private developers nor local authorities are capable of doing” and call on them to take the lead in transforming the very way in which we think about and deliver housing in this country by taking on and leading major developments themselves, rather than simply buying properties built by developers.She will also ask associations to help end the stigma around social housing, admitting that too many people, including politicians, look down on people who live in low-cost homes.“For many people, a certain stigma still clings to social housing. Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority, she will say.“And on the outside, many people in society – including too many politicians – continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home.”She added: We should never see social housing as something that need simply be “good enough”, nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better.44bn to housing and commits to delivering 300,000 net additional homes per year by mid 2020\u0027sMs May used her speech at last year\u0027s Conservative Party conference to announce £2bn of new investment in low-cost housing - enough to build 5,000 new homes per year - although this was criticised as being significantly less than is needed.No 10 said the new £2bn was in addition to the amount announced last year.However, Labour said the latest cash injection would not be enough to reverse the impact of previous cuts to housing budgets.Government quietly drops plans to force councils to sell social homesNumber of social homes to fall by 230,000 by 2020, analysis revealsFewer social homes being built than at any time since Second World WarJohn Healey, Labour\u0027s shadow housing secretary, said: Theresa May’s promises fall far short of what’s needed.“Any pledge of new investment is welcome, but the reality is spending on new affordable homes has been slashed so the number of new social rented homes built last year fell to the lowest level since records began.“If Conservative ministers are serious about fixing the housing crisis they should back Labour’s plans to build a million genuinely affordable homes, including the biggest council housebuilding programme for over 30 years.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/20/09/theresa-may-european-councill-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/20/09/theresa-may-european-councill-1.jpg","title":"brexit latest michel barnier northern ireland border eu theresa may dominic raab salzburg european","story":"Created with Sketch.Most checks could take place away from the border and ports, Michel Barnier saysClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit: EU softens Northern Ireland border \u0027backstop\u0027 plan in bid to avoid no-dealThe EU has moved to soften its backstop proposal for the Irish border in a bid to win Theresa May’s support for it and prevent a no-deal Brexit.Chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the “improved” version of the backstop “is not a border” and that “most checks can take place away from the border: at the company premises or in the markets”.The movement on the EU side comes after Mr Barnier said he wanted to “de-dramatise” the backstop, which eurosceptics, the DUP, and the British government say is acceptable in the form it was proposed in February.Some Brexiteers claim that keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs territory would effectively amount to the annexation of the region by the EU, and Ms May has said that “no UK prime minister” could agree to it.Both sides say they want to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland from appearing in order to preserve the peace process – but they disagree on how to do it.The shift by the Commission comes ahead of a summit in Salzburg, to be attending by Theresa May and her counterparts. EU leaders are there expected to warn yet again that a border backstop is a necessary part of the withdrawal agreement and that without one there would be no deal.“The proposal for the backstop in Ireland and Northern Ireland has been on the table since February,” Mr Barnier said.Most checks can take place away from the border: at the company premises or in the markets“It reflects our agreement with the UK in December 2017 confirmed by Prime Minister Theresa May in a letter in March. We are ready to improve this proposal.\u0026nbsp“Work on the EU side is on-going, we are clarifying which goods arriving in northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when, and by whom these checks could be performed.“We can also clarify that most checks can take place away from the border: at the company premises or in the markets.”He added: “We are working to improve our proposal. You’ve got to remember that the problem in Ireland in the light of the long and positive history of the Good Friday Agreement and the cooperation between both sides and the common travel area, the problem is created here, in particular for goods, by Brexit.“What we’re talking about here is not a border: not a land border, not a sea border. It’s a set of technical checks and controls just about all of which cannot be put other than in a physical place in Northern Ireland. I hope that in practice of simple, practical, objective provisions we’ll be able to find a position where this improved backstop is acceptable. But it will not in any case take the form of a border because we respect the territorial integrity of the UK and we respect the constitutional area of the UK. We will find a practical and operational solution, therefore.”Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

His measured comments erged from an earlier, furious response.\u0026nbspIn the early morning, the Russian Defence Ministry intimated the plane had been hit\u0026nbspby Israeli or French fire. Later, spokesmen changed the story, accepting the plane had been shot down by the Syrians. But\u0026nbspthey ratcheted up the diplomatic fury.\u0026nbspIn quick succession, Moscow said Russians had died as a result of Israel’s “irresponsible actions.” It blamed the Israeli command for giving just a minute’s advance warning of its air strikes. It accused their pilots of using the larger Il-20 plane as cover during missions. It summoned the Israeli ambassador to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Smolenskaya Square and it gave Israel’s defence minister a public dressing-down.\u0026nbsp“The actions of the Israeli defence ministry do not reflect the spirit of the Russian-Israeli partnership,” Sergei Shoigu, the\u0026nbspRussian minister of defence\u0026nbsptold Israeli opposite number, Avigdor Lieberman. “We reserve the right to take further steps.”\u0026nbspThe fierce response suggested a difficult period ahead for Russian-Israeli relations.\u0026nbspUntil that point, cooperation between the two countries had been close. In May, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended Victory Day celebrations in Moscow in\u0026nbspa symbolic gesture at the height of the Kremlin’s international isolation. Russia also seemed to accept Israel’s strategic interests in the region.\u0026nbsp“There was a lot of trust between the two sides,” said Yuri Barmin, an expert at the Russian International Affairs Council on Tuesday. “It was seriously undermined today.”The incident brought back memories of November 2015, when a Turkish fighter shot down a Russian Su-24 jet that had violated Turkish airspace. Russia retaliated with sanctions and seven months of hostile relations\u0026nbspensued.Moscow is trying to be friends with everyone –\u0026nbspwith Assad, Israel, Turkey, the Kurds. That, of course, is the source of the problem\u0026nbspSome of Russia’s more excitable politicians suggested\u0026nbspMoscow could respond\u0026nbspby supplying\u0026nbspDamascus with more advanced C-300 anti aircraft systems – a kind that would prove more problematic for Israeli planners.\u0026nbsp“Russia simply can’t let this drop,” said Franz Klintsevich, member of the Russian senate’s Defence Committee.\u0026nbspBut the likelihood of a serious military response from Russia was always low. Even if it wanted to, Russia does not have the capacity to close Syrian air space to Israeli jets.More fundamentally, it was never going to wade into the undeclared war between Israel and Iran.\u0026nbsp“Russia will not stand in the way of Israeli operations to stop Iranian expansion, knowing how existential they are seen in Jerusalem,” said Jonathan Spyer, research fellow at the Jerusalem Institute of Strategic Studies. “Moscow is trying to be friends with everyone – with Assad, Israel, Turkey, the Kurds.\u0026nbspThat, of course, is the source of the problem.”\u0026nbspRussia-Turkey deal over buffer zone in Idlib met with scepticismUN warns of ‘worst humanitarian disaster’ of 21st century in SyriaRussia ‘resumes airstrikes’ on Syria’s Idlib despite Trump warningIn his afternoon comments, Mr Putin urged\u0026nbspagainst a direct comparison to the Turkish Su-24 incident. That was an intentional strike he said this was “an accident.”\u0026nbspThe president’s unexpectedly\u0026nbspmild response brought into question how much of the initial show of anger against Israel was real – and how much a tactic of\u0026nbspdeflection\u0026nbspfrom a military that had made mistakes.“Russia understood it has only itself to blame for not making sure the Syrians had the right friend-or-foe identification systems,” said Vladimir Frolov, a security expert and former Kremlin advisor.\u0026nbspThere were\u0026nbspother, more obvious questions to be asked. How was it that communication with Syrian allies broke down? How could an anti aircraft system mistake a large reconnaissance plane for a fighter jet?Part of the answer lay in the technology, suggested Justin Bronk, a research fellow at RUSI, an international defence and security think tank based in London.\u0026nbspDesigned in the Soviet Union in the 1950s, the Syrian S-200 surface to air missile unit is not a failproof system, he said. Without newer fire control and radar systems, it would have had difficulty differentiating between the two planes.A lax approach to firing the missiles may also have played a role.\u0026nbsp“During recent attacks, the Syrians have tried to give their public an impression of having effective defences,” said Mr Bronk. “So they have fired missiles blindly – on simple ballistic trajectories, or at least with very weak firing solutions. That may have contributed.”In a statement released on Twitter, the Israeli Defence Forces said the blame for the incident lay “firmly with the Syrian regime,” which had fired missiles “indiscriminately” in response to Israeli\u0026nbspairstrikes.\u0026nbspRussia understood it has only itself to blame for not making sure the Syrians had the right friend-or-foe identification systems\u0026nbspBut the statement also expressed “sorrow for the death of the aircrew members of the Russian plane”.\u0026nbspThat show of humility may have given Mr Putin enough to move on.\u0026nbsp“The operational dynamic may change slightly, but the politics can’t change,” added Mr Barmin. “Russian doesn’t have so many allies that it can throw one of them\u0026nbspunder the\u0026nbspbus.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/18/13/Stormy-Weather-UK.jpg  width= 2467  height= 1850  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/18/13/Stormy-Weather-UK.jpg","title":"storm ali caravan cliff winds ireland galway woman 50s uk weather","story":"Created with Sketch.Tens of thousands of customers without power amid perilous conditionsClick to followThe IndependentStorm Ali blows caravan off a cliff killing woman in her 50s insideA woman has reportedly died after winds from Storm Ali blew a caravan off a cliff with her\u0026nbspinside.The caravan fell over the cliff in County Galway, western Ireland, on Wednesday morning.Police and emergency workers arrived at the cliff site in\u0026nbspCladdaghduff\u0026nbspvillage as high winds still raged.\u0026nbspPolice said they recovered the body of a woman in her\u0026nbsp50s\u0026nbspafter an emergency call at about 7.45am\u0026nbsp​reported.Forecasters have issued an orange-level alert for more than half the country – the second-highest warning.A statement from Irish police said: “Gardai in Clifden, Co Galway are dealing with an incident which occurred at Claddaghduff, Co Galway this morning.“A caravan has blown off a cliff.

That\u0026rsquos one.\u0026ldquoThe second is the common rule book.

Dementia: Is it possible to slow down symptoms?Between 2005 and 2013, 2181 patients (1.7 per cent) were diagnosed with dementia (Image:  STOCK)These diagnoses were found to be linked to ambient levels of nitrogen dioxide and the microscopic particles PM2.5, based on estimates taken near the homes of patients in 2004.Those living in areas with the top fifth of nitrogen dioxide levels had a 40 per cent higher risk of being diagnosed with dementia than those living in areas with the lowest.A similar increase was seen with levels of PM2.5 in the research findings, published in the journal BMJ Open.The links could not be explained by factors known to influence the development of the condition but were more consistent for Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease than vascular dementia.

Our results suggest both regional and urban background pollutants may be as important as near-traffic pollutants.\u0026ldquoThe cause of these neurodegenerative diseases is still largely unknown and may be multifactorial. While toxicants from air pollution have several plausible pathways to reach the brain, how and when they may influence neurodegeneration remains speculative.Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK described the study as a \u0026ldquogrowing area of research, but chief scientific officer Dr David Reynolds added: \u0026ldquoWhile the researchers tried to account for factors like wealth, heart disease and other potential explanations for differences in dementia rates across the capital, it is difficult to rule out other explanations for the findings.\u0026ldquoThe diseases that cause dementia can begin in the brain up to 20 years before symptoms start to show.\u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot know where people in this study lived in the two decades before their dementia diagnosis, so we have to be cautious about how we interpret these results.Separate research, presented on Sunday at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Paris, found children who have green spaces near their homes have fewer respiratory problems such as asthma later in life.Those who are exposed to air pollution are more likely to suffer.

Only one percent of respondents believed God was female.When asked by ITV\u0026rsquos Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan why people are being told it is \u0026ldquooffensive to call God a man, Ms Widdecombe said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think it\u0026rsquos remotely offensive. In fact, I have never heard such nonsense throughout the entire New Testament. Christ is a he and Christ refers to God as the father.\u0026ldquoA father, even in this day and age, is a he.

Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees - Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis and Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000434904044.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"inside the tiny island of mirrors where 100 pairs of twins live one in every three families and no one knows why","story":"Thats because Alabat, home to just 15,000 people, is home to more than 100 pairs of twins.Right now, 78 are non-identical and 22, including four-month-olds Gian and John, look exactly the same.Those two lads are the youngest while Eudosia and Antonia, 86, are the oldest, MailOnline reports.And just to trick people into thinking there might actually be a glitch in the Matrix, many dress the same.Antonia, who married when she was 19, said her husband had a clever way of telling them apart.She said: In the initial days my husband would often mistake Eudosia for me.There were some embarrassing moments when my husband made amorous overtures to my sister thinking that it was me.I then showed him that I have a mole on my nose while my sister does not have one. That solved the problem.The number of twins on Alabat may even have gone up in the last few years.In 2013, Transterra Media reported around 60 of them on the island.At the time, the mayor said four per cent of the islands 12,039 residents were twins.He and his we were shocked to find so many on the island when they migrated there in the 1980s.A historic study found a 182 per cent increase in multiple pregnancies in 35-year-old women between 1996 to 2006 due to the use of fertility drugs.But this could not have influenced Alabat, a remote island which did not have access to the medication.No scientic studies have been carried out to find out why there is such a high ratio of twins on the island."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000420437953.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady column alcohol vanity good health","story":"One day, butter is the enemy. The next it’s sugar. Then carbs. A few weeks later, sugar is back on the naughty step.It’s the same with alcohol. Until recently, a glass of wine a day kept heart attacks at bay. Last month, we learned that NO amount of alcohol is safe. Then this week our new goal, apparently, should be two teetotal days a week.It’s hard to keep up — and no wonder many people ignore all the reports. Who wants to be told what to do by a bunch of scientists who can’t make up their mind?But the latest news from Public Health England should give us all pause for thought, because British women now have some of the lowest le expectancies in Europe.Girls born in the UK today can expect to die three-and-a-half years earlier than girls in Spain, the country that comes out top in this report. The reasons? Rising levels of obesity and poor cancer survival rates.British women also fare badly when it comes to premature deaths — defined as before 75.Many are caused by cancer, heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, which are linked to smoking, alcohol and junk food.France, home of Michelin star chefs, is also way down on the list. And so is Italy.My supporting evidence is that I live with an Italian, who would be more likely to attend a funeral in a jester’s hat than eat a bag of crisps.Clearly, we all need to take a leaf out of the same book.The prevailing wisdom is that it’s more expensive to eat healthily. But that’s not true.A recent report from the Institute of Economic Affairs shows it’s possible to have your five-a-day for less than 30p — and a nutritious,  plain, diet can be bought for less than £1 a day.Meanwhile, the cheapest adult meal in McDonald’s is about £4.50, for which you could make a fresh vegetable curry for the whole family.So it’s not about money. Why, then, do us British women fare so badly?I wonder  we are so daunted by images of women airbrushed to perfection, in adverts and on social media, we feel we can’t compete. So we give up, eating what we like and not exercising.Because keeping really fit takes serious work.The latest insight into this is from movie star Mark Wahlberg who shared his daily schedule this week.He’s in bed by 7.30pm then up at 2.30am for the first of his two daily workouts. His fitness schedule only allows for two hours’ “work” a day — and thus it becomes clear his job is, in fact, his physique.Since most of us spend at least ten hours a day working and commuting, you can see why it’s often easier not to bother.But it’s not just our health that’s in peril. It’s also that of our children, for whom we are the primary role models.Not about vanity, but good healthI have evidence in the form of my best friend, who is a marathon-running exercise junkie — as is her daughter.I, on the other hand, although not proud of this fact, do no exercise — and my daughter doesn’t enjoy it as much as her friends.Getting fit and losing weight can feel impossible.But look at Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who this week announced that he has lost 7st and put his Type 2 diabetes in remission, which is pretty inspiring.So let’s choose to make this bad news story into a positive and use it as inspiration for change.Let’s aim for two booze-free days a week.And maybe ditch the biscuits for a bit and make some other small, sustainable changes that will leave us able to go for a brisk walk without fearing a heart attack.This is not about vanity, it’s about good health. Because the alternative is sobering.When it started off 18 years ago it was innovative and exciting TV. But now it’s degenerated into a hotbed of fame-hungry wannabes pitted against each other and behaving horribly as a result.Now it’s been axed. About time, too.I BELIEVE in people’s right to protest – of course – against political views they disagree with. But, Ian Bone, the protestor who assailed Jacob Rees-Mogg and his children on their own doorstep has crossed a line.“Your daddy is a horrible man,” Mr Bone told Mr Rees-Mogg’s bewildered-looking children, who will likely be traumatised by the incident – and will certainly not forget.MPs are already putting a lot on the line to serve their country. Many endure threats of violence or even death – and just look at what happened to Jo Cox.Yes, it’s fine to disagree with politicians and to protest. But taking it out on children and trying to make them feel bad about their father is bullying behaviour that is wholly unacceptable.Speaking to LBC afterwards, Mr Bone, who is 71, said that he saw no problem with involving children in his protest.But despite being happy to bring Mr Rees-Mogg’s offspring into the argument, he refused to speak about his own five children, and repeatedly refused to answer  he would have been happy for them to be treated in the same way.Talk about hypocritical.EVERYONE praised as progress the BBC’s “solution” to the inequality on comedy panel shows, which has been to ensure there is at least one woman on every show.But then we hear from Sandi Toksvig that their contributions are often edited out.The QI host told the Radio Times: “There are panel shows that struggle to get women on, and that’s because . . . in the edit they are often seen just laughing at the boys and not saying anything at all, even though I know for a fact in the recording they were clever.”Turns out that turning up and being funny isn’t quite enough,  you are a woman, to be given the same air time as men. How annoying.MY Woman of the Week award goes to Carol Vorderman who, at 57, is clearly in her absolute element and loving le.She looks healthy and oozes confidence, especially in these skin-tight jeans.She told ITV’s Lorraine this week she’s happy being single and is not looking for a “keeper” or another intense relationship.In fact, she said she “couldn’t think of anything worse”.How refreshing. And what a great role model she is for women in their fties and beyond.WATCHING the video of a homeless man being sprayed with paint in Middlesbrough made my blood boil.The poor man – who was found dead just days later in a cemetery – is filmed sat against a wall, covered in paint, as a man brags: “This is how we dealwith the beggars on the street.”This disregard for another human being’s dignity is obscene and the yob should be made to volunteer helping homeless people.Until he sees that dehumanising this man who had hit troubled times was the lowest of the low.DID you see Madonna’s daughter, 21-year old Lourdes hitting the runway for the Gypsy Sport Spring Summer 2019 showcase at New York Fashion Week?It’s so dispiriting, isn’t it, that the headline news about her appearance, which could have focused on so many dferent things – her incredible confidence, for one – was that . . . she hadn’t shaved her legs, top.I guess true equality will have been achieved when a woman’s hairy calves go unmentioned and are seen as neither here nor there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs. Wages are rising. Growth is strong.Now we see French companies such as Chanel stampeding to invest billions here.

And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism. But we will avoid the same fate only  the state adopts a new approach on immigration, including more political honesty, tighter border controls and an emphasis on British values.That is not racist.

The EU has to know that she is unafraid to walk away  need be.What does her blundering Remainer Chancellor do?Volunteers his own apocalyptic warning about No Deal reversing our progress since the 2008 crash.Mr Hammond has leapt on the IMF’s latest doom-laden predictions and swallowed them whole, despite its abysmal forecasting record over the financial crisis, austerity and the Brexit vote.The Chancellor has already hampered vital No Deal preparations, undermined the new Brexit Secretary and only last week suggested delaying our departure.Now, at a stroke, he has sabotaged our negotiating hand and boosted the EU’s.It is a measure of the weakness of Mrs May’s position after the loss of her majority that Mr Hammond is still in his job.REMEMBER Brussels mocking the Brexiteers’ idea of high-tech customs checks to solve the Irish border problem?The technology didn’t exist, they said. It was a “fantasy island unicorn model”.Triumphant Remoaners piled in. It proved Brexiteers were clueless, they chirped. And Downing Street then ­produced its convoluted alternative.Except the EU, in the form of Michel Barnier, now believes in the fantasy island unicorn model too. The trouble being it wants it used between Britain and Northern Ireland instead of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.And the DUP, whom Theresa May needs for her survival, won’t wear that. Nor should they, since it ides the UK.Funny though, isn’t it, how Brussels move the goalposts when it suits them? They have negotiated in bad faith all along.TOO many politicians are in denial about the soaring cost of the NHS and social care. So we applaud Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s imaginative plan to sort the latter.The new lelong insurance system he is considering, compulsory for all workers unless they take a risk and opt out, looks a practical idea to fund part or all of an OAP’s care costs.It would give them peace of mind that they wouldn’t have to spend their savings or the proceeds from their home.Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Regardless, it is to Mr Hancock’s credit that he is starting a grown-up conversation at last over future funding of health.For too long progress has been stymied by the Left using any change to the NHS as a political weapon.But the structure of a health service designed in 1948 now needs a radical rethink.It is time reality dawned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didn’t have any other way to contextualise them.But the shows creators rejected claims that they were a couple, describing them as best friends.A statement from the Sesame Workshop stated: They were created to teach preschoolers that people can be good friends with those who are very dferent from themselves.Even though they are identied as male characters and possess many human traits and characteristics , they remain puppets, and do not have a sexual orientation.Some fans didnt take the news that the duo were not romantically involved well with one saying it had broken his heart.Others pointed out that other Muppets do appear to have a sexual orientation highlighting the decades long love affair between Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog.After same-sex marriage was legalised in New York, fans of the show set up a petition asking the shows creators to have Bert and Ernie get married on screen, according to Pink News.The puppet pair also found themselves at the heart of a fierce debate about discrimination and religious beliefs in 2015.A baker in Northern Ireland refused to bake a cake advocating gay marriage with their faces on it.Saltzman told Queerty that he would tell people the duo were based on him and Glassman, adding: I was Ernie.I look more Bert-ish. And Arnie as a film editor —  you thought of Bert with a job in the world, wouldn’t that be perfect? Bert with his paperclips and organisation?And I was the jokester. So, it was the Bert and Ernie relationship, and I was already with Arnie when I came to Sesame Street.So I don’t think I’d know how else to write them, but as a loving couple. I wrote sketches... Arnie’s OCD would create friction with how chaotic I was. And that’s the Bert and Ernie dynamic.A version of this story appeared on news.au"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000434971132.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"twin pays tribute mum sister note","story":"Kellis Hood, 18, said she is broken in two emotional tributes at the spot where sister Casey was fatally injured just before 4am on Friday.Distraught mum Natalie, 46, was found dead on Sunday afternoon - just hours after posting a poignant Facebook tribute saying: I want my little girl back.Casey, who turned 18 last month, died after the Toyota Yaris she was in hit a tree on the way home from a night out in Canterbury, Kent.Dozens of heartfelt messages, balloons, candles and photos were left at the scene on a country road about eight miles from her home in Dover.Grieving Kellis left a handwritten letter at the makesht shrine after losing her identical twin and mum in less than three days.She wrote: “RIP my baby girl, my sister.

Chequers is about the future relationship. I’m putting on the table what we think is the right plan for the UK.”Mrs May also shut down any suggestions that the country could face a People’s Vote.She said: “My answer to the People’s Vote is that we’ve had the people’s vote, it was the referendum – and now we should deliver on it.“I’m confident that we can get a good deal and when people come to look at that as the final end point in these negotiations, I hope people will reflect on the fact that we did give a vote to the people.”Taking a swipe at her Tory Eurosceptic critics she said they have failed produce a detailed alternative to her plans.She said: “The plan that is on the table, the plan that delivers on the Brexit vote but also protects jobs and maintains the unity of the UK, is the Chequers plan. I haven’t seen another plan that delivers on all of those.”Foreign minister Simon Coveney said: “There’s a danger in my view when dficult choices and dficult negotiations need to happen, that decisions get pushed off into November into December. We can’t allow that”.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab warned EU leaders that it’s now the EU’s turn to compromise as the UK has already offered up signicant concessions in the Chequers blueprint.In an article carried by a series of European newspapers, Mr Raab said: ““We made compromises and we showed ambition — and we do need to see that matched on the EU side.“We have shown a lot of flexibility and we have been very pragmatic. So I think this is the moment to see that matched. The ball is a little bit in the other court now”.Mr Barnier confirmed that the EU was ready to come forward with an improved plan for the Irish border - first revealed by The Sun on Saturday.But the proposal - which would see the new customs border between Britain and Northern Ireland policed with invisible technology - has already been thrown out by No10.Speaking ahead of the Salzburg summit, Mr Barnier said: We are ready to improve this proposal. Work on the EU side is ongoing.We are clarying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed, he said.We can also clary that most checks can take place away from the border at the company premises or in the markets. We need to de-dramatise the checks that are needed.A position at once grotesquely offensive, historically illiterate, grievously insulting and — more happily — a fantasy.How dare EU “diplomats” crassly equate the decision facing Theresa May this autumn with Britain standing alone against Nazi bombers? Do ours speak of the Germans or French like that? No.More to the point, Brussels should recall how Britain responded in 1940: with defiance . . . and victory.And Michel Barnier is dreaming  he thinks he can bind a future Government. If we want to elect one committed to severing EU ties further we will.Today, dismissive EU leaders will give Mrs May just ten minutes of their precious time. How can Remainers still defend this outfit? It’s run like the Mob.If and when Brussels finally springs its trap on the PM she must be able to change course instantly or walk away.Voters will be merciless , in panic, they are sold down the river.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If that is reduced it will become a bit harder.“But they could think about finding ways to raise the wages, improve the terms and conditions so that these jobs become more attractive to UK residents.”The MAC was commissioned by ex-Home Secretary Amber Rudd to give a gauge the economic benefits of EU migration – and help the government design a post-Brexit borders visa regime.The verdict split think tanks and experts on both the Remain and Leave side.The MAC said EU migrants on the whole had benefited the economy and dismissed claims the sky-high immigration had contributed to NHS waiting times or school place shortages.But it said there was a noticeable dference between the benefits to Britain from high skilled migrants and lower-skilled, manual workers.It found evidence that migration had dented wages for the poorest Brits by up to 5 per cent since 1997, pushed up unemployment and queues for council houses.A new post-Brexit regime should close the door on all EU migration for jobs below £30,000 a year with the exception of seasonal workers in agriculture.Instead the PM should remove all restrictions on skilled workers – and introduce a visa regime that allowed in as many qualied EU and non-EU workers as business can afford.It also suggested lowering the ‘skills threshold’ to include tradesmen such as plumbers and electricians.Business would have to pay a skills charge of as much as £1,000 for every recruit per year.Migration Watch Lord Green said the MAC appeared to have been “blind to the impact of high levels of EU immigration on many communities in this country”.He stormed: “These proposals would permit continued high levels of immigration, including those with medium skills from all over the world.“The overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control rather than strengthen it.”The Resolution Foundation said that with EU migrants making up 30 per cent of the workforce in food manufacturing and one in five hotel staff, the MAC’s changes would represent “the biggest change to the UK labour market in a generation”.It said Theresa May should lower the skills threshold after Brexit to include a wider range of professions. It could also cover pig breeders, amusement arcade managers and hairdressers.Employers would still have to pay at least £30,000 a year.Migration Watch chair Lord Green said: “If these professions could be eligible for a work permit, the numbers could simply rocket.”The British Chambers of Commerce stormed: “The MAC gives with one hand and takes away with the other, and the recommendations are unlikely to meet the needs of all employers.“Any sudden cut-off of EEA skills and labour would be concerning,  not disastrous for firms across a wide range of regions and sectors.”Home Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted: “Our future immigration system needs to be based on evidence.“Today’s Migration Advisory Committee report helps.“I will closely consider it as we take back control. My thanks to the MAC for their hard work.”THERESA May was told yesterday there should be no preferential treatment for EU citizens in a post-Brexit immigration system.The Migration Advisory Committee said the Government should “discriminate on skills” rather than where a worker is from once free movement rules end.But the MAC said the Government could allow Brussels better terms to seal a new trade deal.It said the benefits for EU migrants working in Britain meant a concession could be a card for the PM to play.THE big migration report looks mainly like common sense.We have long argued that free movement must end and a new post-Brexit immigration policy be designed to suit our economy, not arbitrary limits.So we SHOULD increase skilled workers from around the world and stem the low-skilled. Building firms will have to recruit more Brits and raise pay.And, yes, we must ditch the pro-EU policy that favours its labourers over talented Indian doctors.Where we doubt the Migration Advisory Committee is its claim over the negligible impact of mass migration.Our population has soared by seven million since 2001, mostly via immigration. Schools, hospitals and homes have been built nowhere near fast enough.How can that not have had graver consequences? A few communities have been overwhelmed. Many workers have SEEN it hold down their pay.If the effect has been so tiny, why does the MAC recommend any action at all?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we have learnt lessons.“That’s the same with every single infrastructure project. You learn lessons as you go along.”The £55.7 billion railway is due to be completed by 2033, with Mr Kelly insisting they would meet the deadline.But asked  it would be on budget as well as on time, he would only say they were “working” toward that goal.He added: “Spending tens of thousands of pounds paying an ‘art curator’ to make sure a train - that will not run for another 10 years at least - has the right look and feel is an extraordinarily reckless use of taxpayers’ money.“The Government should cut their losses, abandon this poor value for money project and instead go full steam ahead to improve infrastructure linking northern cities to each other.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hero remains to continue being............ed home to the United States. Also, North and South Korea will file a joint bid to host the 2032 Olympics. Very exciting!Kim and Moon earlier smiled and chatting as they walked down a hallway and into a meeting room to finalise the joint statement.North Korea was expected to hold a huge mass games spectacle later in the day, with Moon attending an event expected to draw about 150,000 spectators, Seoul said.North Korea first staged its mass games in 2002, when Kims father, Kim Jong Il, was leader.They continued most every year until 2014, then were revived during North Koreas celebrations of the 70th anniversary of its state founding earlier this month.Kim gave the South Korean president an exceedingly warm welcome on Tuesday, the first day of the summit, meeting him and his we at Pyongyangs airport.The pair then rode into town with Moon in an open limousine through streets lined with crowds of North Koreans, who cheered and waved the flag of their country.The made-for-television welcome has become routine for their summits, after two meetings earlier this year.The summit talks began at the ruling Workers Party headquarters where Kim and Moon were joined by two of their top deputies.At the start of their meeting, Kim thanked Moon for brokering the June summit with Trump.Kim said: Its not too much to say that its Moons efforts that arranged a historic North Korea-US summit.Because of that, the regional political situation has been stabilised and more progress on North Korea-US ties is expected.Moon responded by expressing his own thanks to Kim for making a bold decision in a New Years speech to open a new era of detente and send a delegation to the South Korean Winter Olympics in February."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000002532888.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"james cook hms endeavour archaeologists rhode island","story":"The possible discovery of the ship Cook sailed to Australia could solve one of the greatest ever maritime mysteries.Archaeologists from the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project  think they have located the resting place of the famous vessel which carried Cook to Australia in 1770.The ship was later used in the American war of independence where it was scuttled, along with 12 other vessels, off Newport, Rhode Island in August 1778 to act as a blockade.There are now plans to try and excavate the sunken vessel next year -

Neither side can demand the unacceptable of the other.And on her Chequers plan - which the EU has said wont work either - she slapped them down for rejecting their ideas which are seen elsewhere.Later the PM will appeal to the other 27 leaders to unlock talks and go over the heads of the European Commission to push ahead towards a deal.What we are proposing is a fair arrangement that will work for the EU’s economy as well as for the UK’s without undermining the single market,” she is expected to say.This would be balanced by a strong security relationship to keep all our citizens safe from threats at home and abroad.The PM will have just a few minutes to make her case to the other leaders, and will join them for a working dinner later.Yesterday Donald Tusk urged them to act responsibly and avoid a catastrophe.But EU leaders are ided on how to deal with the talks - with some wanting the wording to be vague and allow room to move later, and others wanting a clear, detailed proposal on the table now.But little is expected to be achieved in the next few days - and instead a few warm words are predicted to get Mrs May through her annual party conference in two weeks time.The ex-Brexit secretary also said that he thinks talks between the EU and Britain will completely break down later this year, and will require a re-set.Speaking as Theresa May flies to Salzburg to try and sell her plans to other leaders, he warned that her deal meant we would be subsurvient to Brussels for ever.He told Radio 4: Its always the case - the EU move at the last possible moment - after they have taken you to the clf edge.I think well get to a point where she will not be able to accept what they offer, and they will not accept what she offers. They will have to have some kind of re-set.He then predicted that it would come to a point where several other deals would be on the cards instead, and then would be a crucial time to push for a free trade agreement which EU bosses has said would be possible earlier this year.There are plenty of precedents for this, Mr Davis said. There are ready made deals hanging around.The Brexiteer said Brussels would pile on more requests, demands, and asks for more money in the next few months.He said that warm words would be seen today but little action.They want to keep the PM alive, they will see the pressure shes under here back here, they will make her le possible, but they wont give much.The Brexiteer, who is fighting for Theresa May to chuck her current Brexit ideas, said that his plans to negotiate forever wouldnt work.He wrote in The  today in a clear jibe at Mr Gove: Chequers pleases nobody other than the Prime Minister herself. The idea of negotiating forever is so silly that only a very clever person would have come up with it.Last weekend the environment secretary said that getting out now was key, and a future Prime Minister would have the option of securing another agreement  they wanted to.This caused fuming EU bosses to demand that any deal should not be allowed to be unpicked.Mr Rees-Mogg added today: Once a deal is done it will survive for a generation because no one will want to reopen it and the other pressing issues of government will need to be dealt with.The answer remains to chuck Chequers and go for a free trade deal that is on offer and works with the ERG’s effective answer to the Irish question.The Brexit talks are deadlocked over the issue of the Irish border.Brussels wants an operational backstop in place to prevent a so-called hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit.But that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EUs single market and customs union.Theresa May simply wont accept this because it will effectively break up the UK and put a virtual border in the Irish sea.And it will infuriate her coalition partners, the DUP, too, who she relies on to win votes in the House of Commons.A new plan by Mr Barnier – revealed by The Sun on Saturday – to police the new customs border between Britain and Northern Ireland with invisible technology has also been thrown out by No10.Britain wants an agreement to not be needed, by agreeing a close partnership with the EU which would make the backstop void.Yesterday EU boss Michel Barnier hinted that a deal could be reached, and that he was willing to sht proposals on the Irish borer at a meeting next month.Speaking ahead of the Salzburg summit, Mr Barnier said: We are ready to improve this proposal. Work on the EU side is ongoing.We are clarying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed, he said.We can also clary that most checks can take place away from the border at the company premises or in the markets. We need to de-dramatise the checks that are needed.Leaders are also expected to sign off on another emergency Brexit summit in November. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It almost looked alien-like and was slowly moving or contracting.Our initial reaction was impressed, because its an amazing looking thing.And though its stings are rarely fatal, the large number of tentacles mean that medical attention is often recommended after exposure.In July 2010, the broken-up remains of one such jellyfish were big enough to sting some 150 beachgoers near the US town of Rye, New Hampshire.Adam said his kids initially ran up to the jelly fish to take a closer look with his son confirming it was still alive.They pack a hell of a punch, I have been told, said Adam.I had turned a few jellyfish upside down to explain to the kids not to touch the tentacles, but this was the only one I actually wouldnt touch.Is mouth is situated on the bell’s underside, surrounded by tentacles that are ided into eight clusters of up to 150 tentacles each, according to conservation group Oceana.These tentacles contain poison which stun the jelly fish’s prey when they are enveloped.Lion’s mane jellyfish eat small fish, tiny crustaceans and even other jellyfish.The top of the bell is usually dark yellow or red in colour and thick in the centre, but thins out towards the edges.The lion’s mane jellyfish also possess bioluminescent abilities, meaning it’s able to produce its own light and glow in the dark underwater.Jellyfish actually thrive in areas that are affected by human activity such as climate change, pollution and overfishing, scientic research has suggested.That reduces the jelly fishes main predators and competitors and increasing the number of the species on which prey.I have been here nine years and had seen nothing like that.The lions mane jellyfish is regularly seen in the waters of the English Channel, Irish Sea, North Sea and around Scandinavia.While the lions mane is the biggest jelly fish, the deadliest is the irukandji.The irukandji jellyfish is almost impossible to see in water as it is about the size of a match head and has a transparent body.A teenage girl bitten one off the coast of Australia earlier this year was in so much pain, she said she begged her mum to let her die."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435149387.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"portsmouth university freshers week 5000 students big night

James Harding, head of BBC News until last January, has also backed the campaign, telling Sky News: \"The argument is not about who\u0027s going to win, the argument is about politics and public trust.\"It\u0027s about saying that all our politicians reach the largest number of people.\"Willie Sullivan, senior director at the Electoral Reform Society, said a leaders debate is \"essential for the health of our democracy\".\"If a politician believes they are qualied to run the country, they should be willing and able to express the reasons why to the nation,\" he added.

The Prime Minister will hope for harmony as she enjoys a dinner with her 27 fellow leaders in Salzburg, Austria - home of the Sound of Music. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier dangled an olive branch to Britain last night, saying he is ready to improve his position to reach a deal. But he made clear he was still talking about drawing a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK - something Britain has refused to accept. Mrs May wrote in German newspaper Die Welt: Neither side can demand something completely unacceptable from the other.  Tonight\u0027s dinner is the first of three meetings with the other 27 EU leaders before a Brexit deal is needed. The second is an EU Council summit in mid-October before a final, special Brexit summit is expected in November. According to reports, Mrs May will have just 10 minutes to make her case at tonight\u0027s dinner - and EU leaders will then only discuss it tomorrow, once she has left. The UK government insisted today that the deal is virtually agreed - but said the ball was in the EU\u0027s court to compromise. Cabinet minister James Brokenshire said: We have clearly evolved our position and it is now for the EU to evolve its position.  Mr Barnier raised hopes last night when he said: We are ready to improve this proposal. Work on the EU side is ongoing. Mr Barnier urged all sides to de-dramatise the checks that are needed. But he also said the checks were only needed in the first place because the UK is leaving.  He added:  We are clarying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed.  We can also clary that most checks can take place away from the border at the company premises or in the markets.  This statement appears to refer to creating a border down the Irish Sea - something Mrs May says would break up the precious union of the UK. Ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis claimed the EU\u0027s position was softening but warned: They won\u0027t give much.  Meanwhile Mrs May shot down hopes for a second EU referendum in an interview with the , saying: This was probably the biggest exercise in democracy in our country’s history.  If we were to go back on that vote, it would destroy trust in politicians.  My answer to the People’s Vote is that we’ve had the people’s vote - it was the referendum - and now we should deliver on it.” She added: What I hear from other EU leaders is a recognition of the importance of showing we can sit down and come to an agreement. I\u0027m not going to be pushed away from doing what is necessary to get the right deal for Britain. The UK\u0027s current Brexit plan is based on a deal Theresa May drew up at Chequers, her country retreat, in July 2018. At the time it was seen as a major sht to soft Brexit - prompting hard-Leaver Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign. The \u0027Facilitated Customs Arrangement\u0027 is a bid to solve the biggest problem of Brexit - how to stop a hard border between Northern Ireland and either the EU, or the rest of the UK. It would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. Under this plan, the UK would share a common rulebook with Brussels for goods, including agricultural and food products. Britain would also collect some, but not all, customs tarfs on the EU\u0027s behalf. Parliament would technically keep the right to block future rules. But Tory Brexiteers said this olive branch would useless in practice. They forced Theresa May to amend the plan to say the EU should collects tarfs on the UK\u0027s behalf. Mrs May insisted this didn\u0027t scupper her plan. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier disagreed, and has continued to suggest there will be a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Remainers and Labour have also opposed the Chequers plan, saying it leaves Britain half-in-half-out of the EU in the worst of all worlds.  With a November deadline to agree a deal with the EU looming, and the plan facing a vote in Parliament after that, the UK is now ramping up plans to leave in March 2019 with no deal."},{"url":null,"title":"piers morgan bans james brokenshire","story":"NewsPiers Morgan bans James Brokenshire \u0027for LIFE\u0027 from Good Morning Britain after Tory minister refuses an interviewThe presenter made his proclamation after Housing Secretary James Brokenshire refused the chance to be grilled on breakfast TVShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor08:48, 19 SEP 2018Updated10:06, 19 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/politics/video/piers-morgan-bans-housing-minister-13270829,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailITV host Piers Morgan claims to have banned a Tory minister for le from appearing on Good Morning Britain.

Depending on how much you\u0027ve drunk that could be in the form of a throbbing headache that keeps you bed bound all day. But what  you could enjoy prosecco to your heart\u0027s content, without the suffering the morning after? Aldi have come to the rescue with a \u0027hangover free\u0027 bottle of bubbly, part of its new line of organic wines. The \u0026pound7.99 bottle of organic prosecco is sourced from the Corvezzo family\u0027s 150-hectare estate, 30km north-east of Venice. The winery is also eco-friendly and committed to using renewable energy.  But the best bit is, its thought the drink won\u0027t leave you with a fuzzy head in the morning because it has fewer sulphite preservatives - the nasties that can help give you a hangover - meaning you should be less likely to be stuck nursing a hangover. And that\u0027s not all. The fruit for the prosecco is grown with “no pesticides or herbicides” – another factor thought to lessen the chances of a hangover. Tweeting about its new organic range recently, the supermarket made a nod to the drink’s ‘hangover proof’ qualities, writing: We’re raising a glass this Organic September to our range of delicious, organic wine. Apparently, they’re hangover-proof… better have a glass to find out.

Hot weather and lack of rain are to blame for making the potatoes smaller according to European farmers. Britain is world\u0027s largest importer of chips alongside the US, consuming some 1.75million tonnes of the frozen iety each year. Some 750,000 tonnes of frozen chips are sourced from Belgium and the Netherlands, with the rest from British potatoes.  However, farmers in the UK are also facing a ten to 15 per cent drop in crop yields. Britain is one of the biggest consumers of potatoes in the European Union, with the average person eating 100kg of potatoes every year. As a result of the shortage, we should brace ourselves for smaller chips which could end up having up to an inch cut off.  Cedric Porter, the editor of World Potatoes Market, told The Daily  : “This was the hottest British summer 1976, which any potato person will tell you was an almost mythical year.  It is still talked about in potato circles. The chips are down. You can expect smaller chips in Britain and in Europe.” Belgian and Dutch farmers could also struggle to fulfil their contracts.

Charles McLaughlin suffered a massive stroke and is on le support with two blood clots on his brain. Facing a \u0026pound100,000 bill for treatment and a medical flight, the 38-year-old\u0027s family asked the Foreign Office for a crisis loan to help to bring him back to Scotland.  But their request was denied because they don\u0027t meet the Government\u0027s criteria, and his mum Esther now fears he won\u0027t survive  he doesn\u0027t  to the UK soon, the Daily Record reports.   The family have raised more than \u0026pound40,000 but say they have been let down by the Foreign Office, who can provide emergency loans to British nationals in trouble abroad – but only in “exceptional circumstances”. The Foreign Office said it can provide a small emergency loan in those cicrumstances, but only for a one-way economy fare. The loan cannot be used to cover the costs of medical repatriation or medical bills, it said. Esther has hit out at the Government, saying: “They have the power to fly my son home but instead they are handing him a death sentence. “Charles will need medical equipment and assistance on the flight and he’s getting weaker by the day. The hospital can’t give him the expert care he needs and our only option is to get him home without delay.  “I do not expect the Government to pay my bills, I asked for a loan that I will repay. “I’ve applied to remortgage my house and this process doesn’t happen overnight. The Government are aware of this. Once the remortgage is through, I can pay every penny back. “I’ve been denied an emergency loan three times now and want to know why the Government are refusing to help a tax-paying family affected by an overseas crisis? “He’s my only son and I just want to get him back to give him a fighting chance.” Charles was found unconscious in a flat in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh on September 6. He is unable to speak or breathe unaided and can only communicate using his eyelids. Esther flew to south-east Asia to keep a vigil by her son’s hospital bed. Her daughters, Jenner and Lyndsay, have set up an online appeal to try to raise the cash needed to fly their brother home.  Jenner, 42, said: “Charles is being left to die out there. We are all in bits and just want him flown back. “Neurologically, the hospital can’t give him the care he needs. If we don’t get him home, then he won’t make it. “It’s breaking our hearts knowing he’s stuck out there helpless.” Charles, originally from Gourock, Renfrewshire, decided to go travelling last November after being made redundant from his advisory role with HSBC in London. He went to Cambodia with his girlfriend but decided to extend his stay while she ed home. However, his travel insurance had run out and he is not covered for medical expenses. Charles had been staying in cheap rental accommodation. He became friends with his landlord, who grew concerned when he hadn’t heard from Charles for a few days. He let himself into the apartment and found the Scot unconscious on the floor. Charles’s family are having to stump up \u0026pound300 a night for hospital costs but staff are unable to offer him the expert care he would receive on the NHS.

He does not have any additional needs, but his parents believe it is in his best interests to start school next year, once he is five and at compulsory school age .  In her blog, Dirt, Diggers and Dinosaurs , his mum explains her reasons for holding him back by applying to defer his admission to school for a year. She starts by saying: We’ve done something that many of our friends and family will view as controversial. We have decided not to send Stanley to school this year. Instead, he will be starting next September when he is five. For the extra year he will be attending preschool part time, playing, bonding with his brothers, playing, exploring, enjoying days out, playing, growing and developing at his own pace. She then answers some of the questions she says she\u0027s been asked.  No, Stanley does not have any special educational needs. No, we haven’t ‘held him back’ because he was struggling at preschool. No, it’s not that we can’t bear to let him go, and I want to keep him a baby. No, we aren’t doing it for ourselves and not thinking about what’s best for him. No, we’ve not thrown our dummy out because he didn’t a place at our first choice of school this year... he did. No, we’ve not done what’s easiest for us.   As you can probably tell from the answers above, I’ve had a bit of an ear bashing by some which I hope is mostly fuelled by misinformation and misunderstanding, she says. Explaining her decision, she said: The plain fact is, he’s four. We’ve simply chosen not to send him to school early, we are sending him at school age which  you go back a generation was the absolute norm. I personally believe that in the UK all children start school too early and that we’d be better off following our European neighbours whose children start school at aged seven when they are emotionally and physically ready.  We were recently informed at a preschool parents evening that Stanley  would soon cope with starting school, as he’s really bright. This really hit home for me, a four year old shouldn’t have to cope with anything. Emma, from Hull, Yorkshire, who is expecting another baby, says she decided to write the blog to let other parents know it is possible to prevent your child from starting school at the age of four, as she believes it\u0027s not widely known. This year three set of parents have successfully applied to Hull City Council to defer their child\u0027s entry to school. Emma said: I’ve had two relative strangers - who I only know through ious kids clubs - tell me that they think it’s amazing, and one who asked me to email her the info so she could then look into it for her daughter. She had no idea that the option was available, which I think is a massive issue. Thanks to a change in DfE legislation, we not only have the choice whether to start his school journey prior to CSA or at CSA but also have the right to request admission into Reception class at CSA rather than Year One, ensuring that he will not lose a vital whole year of early education. I think an extra year of being a child with no responsibility or pressure can only be a good thing. When I read articles about phonics tests in Year one ages five and six and SATS at ages six and seven it makes me so sad. When did being a child become so target driven? Aren’t we told by midwives and health visitors that ‘they all learn at their own pace?\u0027 Why does this suddenly change when they enter the school system? The extra year at home will be an extra year of developing emotionally and at his own pace. An extra year of learning through play, exploration and love.  A controversial decision which is a big \u0027gamble\u0027 Emma said she 100 per cent believes she has made the right decision for Stanley, but admits there is a big gamble involved. She said: The BIG gamble in all of this and the only thing that regularly niggles at me is whether we will get offered our first choice school again in the next round of admissions. If we don’t, then will our offered school be happy to support a CSA Reception start, or will they be championing Year 1? The LEA and school would have to provide evidence that missing a whole year of education would be in his best interests. I guess we’ll just have to face any obstacles, and fight the battles as we get to them. However Emma signs the blog post off by saying as she sits there writing the post and watching Stanley performing a puppet show for his brother using three toy dinosaurs, she knows with all certainty that this is the best thing for her child.

She is a woman not only out of her depth, has not only floundered for more than a decade, but has no idea where she\u0027s gone wrong. It\u0027s hard to see her without thinking of a fly batting itself against a window until it expires, able to see the fresh air but unable to find it. If she reads this - which she might, because she defines herself only by what others think of her - she\u0027ll assume I\u0027m a Left-wing liberal about to rail against her Right-wing freedom of speech. No, Katie. Someone who knows more than you is going to explain how the hatred has suffocated you. We both have epilepsy - mine very mild, hers very severe. The condition strikes in her sleep, led to her being expelled from Sandhurst, to break vertebrae and frequently dislocate her shoulders. She recently had brain surgery that ended the seizures but left her with a hole in her skull and needing to re-learn how to climb stairs. She blames the medication she has needed since young for the fact her oldest daughter is autistic and her youngest was born with a deformed hip that required many surgeries to correct. Those would be enough disability for most people to deal with. But Katie has an extra one - a mistaken belief that she\u0027s a journalist.  Let\u0027s not be precious about the Street of Shame. It is a trade, not a profession, and the only qualication necessary is a level of enthusiasm bordering on mental illness. But somewhere along the line most journalists get training. They get it from a practical degree, a vocational course, or at worst from paying attention to people who\u0027re doing it already. Katie became a journalist because first she became a media star, and she managed THAT with what she called being outspoken and everyone else called being a right cow. On The Apprentice in 2006 she hogged the camera by making amusingly-nasty remarks about maternity leave, fat people, and fellow contestants. She resigned at the end of the penultimate show citing childcare concerns, which others mocked because she had known what she was getting into. But it\u0027s perhaps worth noting both that her concerns were for two disabled daughters, and also that she was mocked mainly because she\u0027d been so happy to mock others.  Katie sold her story for six-figure sums, had celebrity spats, and was pictured in flagrante in a field with someone else\u0027s husband. She got a regular column in her local paper the Exeter Express \u0026amp Echo , but it ended after an online poll found 84% of the readers wanted her fired. It was a hint she did not take. She was invited onto TV as a guarantee of ratings. Three years ago Buzzfeed reported a former staffer at This Morning said she was always willing to cause controversy from the word go. Such programmes involve a chat with a producer in advance, and Katie would immediately come up with a firm line on something, and then wheeled on-air to spout it with little thought from either her or producers about where it would end. So in 2013 when she told Philip and Holly she wouldn\u0027t let her children play with someone called Tyler or Chardonnay or named after geography, it was pointed out one of her children was called India and the clip went viral.  Katie learned to make money by being rude and unapologetic, and the media learned to shore up their audience figures with a wingnut. Inevitably, she was offered a national newspaper column, a place in the Big Brother house, and more opprobrium as the hate multiplied. In 2015 she used her column to denounce migrants as cockroaches, and it quietly disappeared before she popped up at another website which racked up \u0026pound150,000 damages plus costs for her groundless claim that a pair of Muslim brothers banned from travelling to Disneyland were linked to al Qaeda. She met holocaust deniers, tweeted about being with crew of a Save the Children ship she didn\u0027t board, and had repeated applications to join UKIP rejected. She made a habit out of getting it wrong. She moved on to LBC, left after calling for a final solution to Islamic terror, was questioned but not charged over alleged hate crimes, and more recently staged a picture with children at a school without their parents\u0027 or teachers\u0027 permission, a gross breach of journalistic ethics. She has her own website and, one hopes, has invested in some defamation legal insurance. Now she\u0027s been sued over a defamatory tweet, lost her home, and had to enter an agreement with her creditors. All of it is due to the simple fact that she attempted to be a journalist without any of the necessary skills.  If Katie had experience of working in the media before she became its favourite monster, she\u0027d have known that what you don\u0027t say is just as important as what you do. By all means say you\u0027re snobby about the name Charmaine, but it might be an idea to know Shakespeare was happy to use it for one of his characters. If you make a habit of racking up legal bills for your employer, be careful with what you publish on social media. If you are caught lying, stop doing it. Steer clear of people with swastikas in their Twitter handles and  you don\u0027t know what defamation is, look it up. But more than anything else the lesson that Katie needed to learn was this: that becoming a hate figure is a viable but short media career. She chose a path that was an ever-decreasing spiral of bile, and it was only ever going to lead her into peril. I\u0027m not sure she knows how she got there. She started out as entertainment, and ended up with the twin Pyrrhic victories of being praised by Donald Trump and winning an IPSO ruling against the Daily Mirror about the fact she was not detained for taking ketamine in South Africa, but for spreading racial hatred. Now she\u0027s broke and the only people still paying attention are creditors and knicker-snfing Nazis.  Katie was not a journalist but a controversialist - built and brought down by her ignorance of how journalism works. Her name is flung at others who make a much better fist of it, along with accusations they all want to be like her. Nothing could be further from the truth - journalists, above all things, want to be right. Katie was just a story, and it\u0027s a sad indictment of the media that it relied for attention on a sick woman spouting proto-fascist lies. But the principal blame is on Katie herself. She had enough clues, from as early as her first interview after leaving The Apprentice when Nick Hewer said her new brand had made you famous, but it\u0027s made you loathed. And where\u0027s it going to take you now? She never seems to have asked where it would lead. Even with training, she would never have made much of a journo. She has a thick skin and bloody-mindedness, but seems to lack empathy, accuracy, self-doubt or persuasiveness. She is a curiosity, but doesn\u0027t have any. The first rule of journalism is \u0027never become the story\u0027. Not just because it\u0027s professionally embarrassing, but because all copy finishes the same way - with the word \u0027ends\u0027. * Fleet Street Fox\u0027s new book, A Bluffer\u0027s Guide To Journalism, is published in March.

But Domestos believes that a clean and safe toilet should be within everyone’s reach so it is helping to answer the public’s prayers. Its Use Our Loos campaign, launched earlier this month, is inviting businesses across Britain to sign up, open their cubicles and welcome everyone - customers and non-customers - to use their loos. And they’ve also agreed to feature on the Great British Public Toilet Map – a free interactive street map developed by Domestos and Public Convenience. The map - the UK’s largest database of publicly-accessible toilets - includes lavs that are located in local businesses as well as those at bus and train stations, shopping centres, libraries, leisure centres and hotels.  And it’s compiled using information from councils, the businesses themselves and YOU! As well as using the map to discover nearby loos, the public can help improve the service by adding new locations or flagging loos that have closed. Anyone can go on the website and add or edit the correct information about the toilet such as who can access it, opening hours, or facilities available. Just click on the Great British Toilet Map image below to reveal the map and find your nearest available toilet...   By visiting toiletmap.org.uk on a computer of smartphone, your device will automatically find your location and reveal your nearest available toilets. Users can also look for loos before leaving their home or office by typing in a postcode to search other areas.  As well as pinpointing the exact location of nearby public toilets, helpful information is featured about each one including whether there’s a charge and  it has an attendant. There is also a tool which lets users set preferences to highlight any specic needs they might have, such as whether it has disabled access and baby changing facilities, and what the opening hours are.

Mike North, 36, says he and his we Lucy, 37, were denied a free pass for 11-year-old Isabelle because they live within three miles of her school. But Mr North claims he carried out his own survey and found that his home in Swanland, East Yorkshire, is 3.021 miles from South Hunsley School in Melton.  East Riding Council wouldn\u0027t budge, however, and the Norths have been left scrambling to get their three children to two schools so Isabelle doesn\u0027t have to walk three miles along dangerous roads, Hull Live reports.   The council said it only awards free bus passes based on distances calculated by its own “geographic information system  mapping system,” which showed the distance to be less than three miles. Mr North said: “It’s an hour’s walk there and an hour’s walk back which the council are expecting her to do. We won’t let her do it because it’s a long way and she would have to set off early to get to school and for an 11-year-old it’s just not safe. “She would have to walk down dangerous roads, some of which have no street lights or footpaths, and in the winter it will be dark.”  Isabelle started at South Hunsley two weeks ago and since then, the Norths have had to juggle trying to take her and their six-year-old twins to their two schools in the morning and picking them up in the afternoons. When Isabelle has used the bus it has cost her \u0026pound4 a day – a figure which the Norths say they cannot continue to afford to pay. Mr North says not having the free bus pass has caused his eldest child a great deal of upheaval during the first two weeks at her new school. He said: “It has been a bit stressful for her. She was already worried about going to secondary school and the situation with the bus pass has made things worse.  “A lot of her friends are on the bus and being driven to school by your parents isn’t the coolest thing, especially when you’re starting at a new school. “When I started secondary school I remember that everything was new and it was like a whole new world. Isabelle doesn’t need the added stress of not being able to get on the bus with her friends.” Mr North has been offered the chance to buy an annual bus pass for Isabelle for \u0026pound520 and although he is livid at not being given a free one, he feels he may have to bite the bullet and pay the price. However, he believes the council is compromising his daughter’s safety by not giving her the free bus pass.

Amber and yellow danger to le warnings for wind have been issued for all of Northern Ireland and Scotland, and parts of northern England and Wales ahead of the first named storm of the 2018-19 season. Forecasters say heavy rain, flying debris, falling trees, power cuts, flooding and travel disruption are possible in the worst-hit areas when Ali hits on Wednesday. The major storm could batter some places for more than 16 hours. Here is the latest map and tracking details revealing when and where Ali is expected to wreak havoc.  Where will Storm Ali hit? Warnings are in place for the following areas from 6am on Wednesday: Scotland Central, Tayside and Fe: Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Falkirk, Fe, Perth and Kinross, Stirling. Grampian: Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Moray. Highlands and Eilean Siar: Na h-Eileanan Siar, Highland.

North West: Cumbria, Lancashire. Yorkshire and Humber: North Yorkshire. Northern Ireland County Antrim, County Armagh, County Down, County Fermanagh, County Londonderry, County Tyrone. Wales Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Isle of Anglesey.  When will Storm Ali hit? Torrential rain and strong winds will hit Northern Ireland and western parts of Scotland in the early hours of Wednesday. Ali will then sweep across the west of Scotland and northern parts of England and Wales through the morning. Fierce winds and heavy rain will persist through the afternoon and, in some places, into the evening. A yellow warning for wind is due to expire at 10pm on Wednesday, while the more severe amber warning is set to end at 5pm. Ali is arriving one day after the remnants of former hurricane Helene slammed some areas with 80mph winds and heavy rain. What are the biggest threats? Ali\u0027s winds will gust to 80mph and up to 70mm of rain is possible in parts of western and central Scotland. According to the Met Office, people in the warning areas should prepare themselves for:  Flying debris is likely and could lead to injuries or danger to le. Road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected, with longer journey times and cancellations possible. Some damage to buildings is possible, such as tiles blown from roofs. Falling trees or branches. Power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage. Some roads and bridges may close.   The Met Office said in its amber warning: Storm Ali will bring a spell of very strong winds to Northern Ireland from early on Wednesday morning, before these strong winds spread to far northwest England and central and southern Scotland by late morning. Strong winds will be accompanied by heavy squally showers. Some areas, especially high ground and coastal regions, including within the Central Belt, could see gusts of 80 mph at times. Winds will ease from the west through the afternoon. Ali is the first named storm of the 2018-19 season. The Met Office and Ireland\u0027s national weather service have decided to name major storms to bring greater urgency to warnings that encourage people to take precautions. Bronagh, Callum and Deirdre are among the other names to be used this season.  Why was an amber warning issued? The Met Office uses three colours to warn of dangerous storms - yellow, amber and, for the most severe, red. An amber warning is issued when severe weather could put lives in danger and disrupt travel. The Met Office said: You should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property. You may want to consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact.

We are going to see my family in Jamaica. I am going home to see my uncle George and all the cousins.’ “He was in shock, but so happy. Just overwhelmed by the students\u0027 kindness. “It is amazing, he had no idea. We are both in shock. They are lovely students.”  Mr Gordon has worked at Bristol University as part of the cleaning staff for 12 years. Last June, Mr Gordon was dubbed an “icon” by the University of Bristol Library\u0027s Instagram page, saying he was a familiar face to many of the medical students at the university. His hobbies include supporting Arsenal and playing the lottery, “hoping one day to hit the jackpot and move back to Jamaica”, according to the page. A video of Mr Gordon being surprised with the money was posted online where he becomes emotional and thanks the Bristol students for their kind token of appreciation.

Ali is first on the storm names list for 2018-19 announced by the Met Office and Met Eireann, which has run the Name Our Storms scheme for four years. The season\u0027s names have been compiled from a list of submissions by the public, choosing some of the most popular names and also selecting those which reflect the nations, culture and ersity of the UK and Ireland.  The practice is aimed at raising awareness of severe weather before it hits, with polling finding almost 80% of people think naming storms is useful in making them realise severe weather may have a greater impact than normal. The unsettled weather is due to last right through the week, Mr Wilson added, but an improvement is expected early next week as drier weather is set to take hold.

And by the time you arrive back at the airport after a long flight, you probably want nothing more than to get back to the house sharpish and crawl into bed.  So you might book a taxi or order an Uber to whisk you off to your destination.   This is exactly what one man did, booking a driver using the Uber app , but he was in no way prepared for what happened when the car turned up.   Surya Oruganti arrived at Bengaluru International Airport in India and waited for his driver to arrive. But when they came to pick him up, he soon realised something wasn\u0027t right with the driver. Not only was he not the driver the app had claimed would get him, he was also drunk. Fearing for his safety, Surya made them stop the car and soon found himself in the drivers seat for the 30km trip home.  He shared details of the bizarre trip on Twitter .   In a post, in which he shared an image of the intoxicated driver, he said: The ride back from Bangalore airport was not quite what I expected. The driver was drunk and drowsy. I had to pull the car over to the side and I drove all the way home. Pic with the driver in the rider seat passed out. Surya also shared videos of the driver saying he was drunk enough to not know he was being recorded. He claims Uber\u0027s safety team called him back 20 hours after the incident and said he shouldn\u0027t drive a cab because that\u0027s a safety issue.

Laura Weiser, 28, purchased a Disney princess face mask from Primark last week, planning a relaxation session. On Saturday, after an exhausting day redecorating the front room of her house with husband Alan, Laura decided to have a soak in the bath before heading to bed, wearing the \u0026pound3 Princess Jasmine face mask. But when her husband clapped eyes on her he burst out laughing, prompting her to clamber out of bed and take a selfie to see what all the fuss was about. Laura, a full-time mum, was shocked when she realised she looked less Disney princess and more like Leatherface from 1974 horror film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Laura, from Oxford, said: It looks beautul before you put it on, but when it\u0027s on it\u0027s a really scary-looking face - it\u0027s absolutely terrying. I knew as soon as my husband saw me that something was up, he was just sat next to me in bed in stitches. That\u0027s never a good sign. I remember thinking to myself \u0027it can\u0027t be that bad\u0027 so I got up and took a picture. But yes, it really was. It\u0027s quite an unusual look with big eyes printed on it, I\u0027ve never had a sheet mask where the eyes are covered up before, I guess it\u0027s to give you the full effect. It reminded me of the character Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Self-professed Disney fan Laura who lives with Alan and their four children Bonnie, 10, Nigel, 8, Dennis, 5, and Lincolnr, 2, snapped up the cucumber sheet face mask from the Oxford branch of the chain a fortnight ago. When the mum-of-four opened the packaging to the \u0027A Whole New World\u0027 face mask she was thrilled to see the outline of Princess Jasmine\u0027s face sporting her signature cat-eye make-up, scarlet lips and gold earrings. However when the mask went on it distorted the hugely popular character\u0027s features leaving friends and family in stitches at her bizarre look. Pals posting on social media compared her to the murderous Leatherface - who wears masks made of his victims\u0027 skin. Laura said: My daughter Bonnie found it hilarious but I took it off after 15 minutes as I was worried about the younger kids walking in and seeing me,  they had they would have probably cried. It looked atrocious, it was the most bizarre thing ever, but a really good novelty. Alan looked over at me and burst out laughing. The mouth didn\u0027t line up, so it looked like I had two mouths and it was just really scary, but also funny.  I sent a picture to my mother-in-law and sister-in-law and they sent messages back with lots of laughing emojis. Laura said that although the face mask was the cause of a few laughs, she couldn\u0027t fault the quality of the product which left her skin feeling refreshed. Laura said: Despite looking so terrying, the product itself was amazing, I had lovely skin afterwards and my face was very moisturised.

Speaking at their summit talks in Pyongyang, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said they agreed to turn the Korean peninsula into a land of peace without nuclear weapons and nuclear threats. He also said he will visit Seoul in the near future, in what would be the first-ever visit to the South\u0027s capital by a North Korean leader. North and South Korea plan to link up railways, allow family reunions and will seek to host the 2032 Olympics.  Until now, the two countries have technically still been at war, despite the armed conflict ending in the 1950s. However, South Korea said afterwards that the agreements effectively mean the end of the Korean War. A spokesperson said: Leaders of the South and the North have in fact announced the end of the war on the Korean Peninsula by their agreements. A 1953 armistice agreement ended the fighting but a peace treaty was never signed. The latest summit will be a litmus test for stalled negotiations on the North\u0027s nuclear programme between Pyongyang and Washington, and for another meeting Kim recently proposed to U.S. President Donald Trump following their historic encounter in June in Singapore. Kim pledged to work toward the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula during his first encounter with Moon, and at his summit with Trump in June.

Civilians described gang rapes on an industrial scale, toddlers being swung against tree trunks until they were dead and families barricaded in their homes to be burned alive. When a mother fled from one inferno carrying a small baby she was shot and the child crushed to death by a soldier, an eye-witness said. The testimony was gathered from 100 people who survived an offensive in Unity State, in the northern Greater Upper Nile region of the country, between April and July this year. Government troops are accused of giving free rein to youth militias, unleashing a wave of systematic slaughter. The epicentre of the violence was Mayendit and Leer counties, areas held by the opposition.  Witnesses described civilians being slaughtered in their villages. Some were burned alive in their tukuls - traditional mud huts which often have a thatched roof. A man believed to be over 90 had his throat slit. Nyaweke, a 20-year-old woman, said she saw soldiers shoot dead her father and kill a number of children in Thonyoor, in Leer There were seven men [soldiers] who collected the children and put them into a tukul and they set the tukul on fire. I could hear the screaming. They were four boys. One boy tried to come out and the soldiers closed the door on him. There were also five boys whom they hit against the tree, swinging them. They were two [or] three years old. They don’t want especially boys to live because they know they will grow up to become soldiers. In a separate incident in Rukway village, also in Leer, a couple and their two grandsons were burned alive in a house. Their daughter attempted to flee with her baby but she was shot and her child stamped to death. Even those who fled their villages had little chance of survival. Soldiers used amphibious vehicles to hunt those who had fled into swamps.  Nyalony, an elderly woman, told Amnesty she witnessed soldiers killing her husband and two other men: When the attack started, early in the morning while we were sleeping, my husband and I ran to the swamp together. Later in the morning, after the fighting was over, the soldiers came into the swamp looking for people, and sprayed the area where we were hiding with bullets. My husband was hit he cried out in pain. He was still alive, though, and the soldiers caught him, and then they shot him again and killed him. He was unarmed and wasn’t a fighter just a farmer.” Survivors faced unspeakable horror. Women and young girls said that they were abducted before being gang raped, sometimes for many weeks. Others were used as slaves to cook and clean for their captors. A 60-year-old man found his niece after she had been sexually assaulted by five men. She was just 13. My brother’s daughter was raped and she was going to die, he said. When they raped her, we came and found her and she was crying and bleeding … she couldn’t hide … she told me she was raped by five men. We could not carry her and she could not walk. There were also reports of sexual mutilation and castration.  Nyatap, who is around 32, gave a graphic account of her ordeal. Eight months pregnant, she was abducted with her five-year-old son and daughter, seven. There were 20 soldiers, she said. The other women who are not pregnant were raped. There was another lady... she was three months\u0027 pregnant and she miscarried. She was raped by 10 men. I saw it happen. They were just raping her under another tree. They put us in one compound.... there were other ladies... They would take turns raping them. Soldiers accused of carrying out the slaughter are also said to have looted and burned on a vast scale, making it virtually impossible for survivors who had fled to  to their homes. Amnesty claims that the situation was enabled by South Sudan\u0027s government failing to prosecute suspected war criminals for previous massacres in 2016. Four people had been identied but no action had been taken. Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East Africa, said: “A key factor in this brutal offensive was the failure to bring to justice those responsible for previous waves of violence targeting civilians in the region. “Leer and Mayendit counties have been hard hit in the past, and yet the South Sudanese government continues to give suspected perpetrators free rein to commit fresh atrocities. The result has been catastrophic for civilians.” Amnesty has called for immediate end to all human rights abuses. Joanne Mariner, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Response Adviser, said: “It’s impossible to ignore the cruel reality –  the South Sudanese authorities had acted on our warnings back in 2016, this latest wave of violence against civilians in Leer and Mayendit might have been avoided. The only way to break this vicious cycle of violence is to end the impunity enjoyed by South Sudanese fighters on all sides. The government must ensure that civilians are protected and that those responsible for such heinous crimes are held to account.

Alan Cumming, national estate agency director at Aberdein Considine, said this was the first clear sign of the museum having an impact on the city’s property market.He said: “Dundee has been undergoing a renaissance as this magnicent new landmark takes shape on the banks of the Tay.“The city has a growing UK and global profile and with more than 500,000 people expected to visit over the next year, this is only going to grow.“Dundee is one of the most affordable cities in the UK for first-time buyers, which makes it a popular choice for young house-hunters.“We may well be at the beginning of a period of sustained price growth and I am incredibly optimistic about what the future holds for the city’s property market.”Across Scotland as a whole, prices have soared to a record high of £169,450 after a summer market heatwave inflated prices in 27 out of the country’s 32 local authority areas.But more than three-quarters of the people surveyed by Scotland’s Property Monitor indicated that they had no intention of buying a new home, up from 43% in the first quarter.Back in July, the Tele revealed how house prices in Dundee had increased by 1.5% in May, which contributed to a 5.4% rise over the last 12 months.During that time, the average property in the area sold for £121,580 – signicantly lower than the UK average of £226,351.Buyers who made their first step on to the property ladder in the City of Discovery in May spent an average of £104,591.In September last year, it was reported by Aberdein Considine that property prices in Dundee were rising twice as fast as the Scottish average.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee man pens open letter to the driver who nearly knocked me and my dog down","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee man and his we have taken action after reporting a suspected drink-driver to the police.Tom and Jet Connelly were walking close to the Blue Grotto roundabout \u0026#8211 linking Brantwood Avenue, Harefield Road, Strathmore Avenue and Johnston Avenue \u0026#8211 when they claim to have been knocked down by a reckless motorist.The pair wrote in a letter to the Tele: \u0026#8220To the driver who nearly knocked me and my dog down on Saturday at 9.30pm.\u0026#8220I have now reported you to the police as you were stinking of drink and your language would have made the most hardened of men blush.\u0026#8220As you know, you stopped halfway up Brantwood Avenue and reversed back.\u0026#8220Luckily, you never did any damage to other cars and you parked your car on the circle opposite Blue Grotto and blocked the whole road.\u0026#8220I only hope the shops have CCTV as drivers in your condition should never be allowed behind the wheel of a car.\u0026#8220You were driving a large navy car and had a partial stutter, which may have been down to your alcohol intake.\u0026#8220Two cars parked behind you as they couldn’t move anywhere.\u0026#8220May I remind you that Johnston Avenue is now a dedicated 20mph road and not 70mph as you were doing.\u0026#8220My dog was wearing a reflective collar and I had on reflective clothing, but as you did so much shouting, used such foul language and told me what you intended to do to my face, why don’t you come forward and identy yourself?\u0026#8221A police spokesman said: “Police Scotland were made aware of this incident and the matter is under inquiry.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba0cca9e24d4.jpg ","title":"dundee site could be transformed into 17 5m comics museum and cultural centre","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWest Ward Works in Dundee could be set for a £17.5 million transformation into a cultural centre and comics museum.The former printworks, owned by DC Thomson, has previously hosted the Dundee Design Festival.Work on the project, which would “complement” the V\u0026ampA, could begin within months  the project secures funding through the Tay Cities Deal.The long-awaited deal would mean about £1 billion invested in Dundee, Tayside and north-east Fe over a decade.

I don’t want to criticise the referee but, according to me, it was a very soft penalty.“I asked my players  there was contact there but they didn’t think it was one which you have to give.”Of United’s display, Csaba added: “I think for 90 minutes plus added time we played one-way football.“The boys tried hard and it’s not easy when the clock is ticking down and you still can’t score.“In the first-half we had two very good chances where we should score and in the second half we were pressing Morton.“They were, more or less, 11 behind the ball playing very deep and they tried to counter attack.“Sometimes you have these games where you have to suffer but we have to be more clinical, must be more clinical.“We can talk about the many mistakes but we have to play faster, more with the ball into feet and up front but I think on Saturday everybody showed spirit.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba20edd834d9.jpg ","title":"its a nonsense local table tennis star gavin rumgay ruled out of scotland side","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLocal table tennis hero Gavin Rumgay has hit out at not been named in the Scottish team to play in this week’s European Championships in Alicante, Spain.The 33-year-old, who recently won a bronze medal at the International Federation event in Lagos, claims he was left out due to not making himself available for an away international against Finland on a midweek night.The association confirmed he did not make himself available but say the door is open for him to  to Scotland duty.They add Rumgay, originally from Perth but now based in London, has been chosen to face Finland in Drumchapel, Glasgow, on October 2.An association spokesperson said: “Gavin has not been selected for the Euro Championships but the door is always open for him and he has been selected to face Finland in Glasgow next month.”Gavin claimed he couldn’t make the previous date in Finland as he has been doing a lot of travelling and playing and felt competing there on a Tuesday night would not be beneficial to him.He added: “I am ranked 136 in the world and the next nearest Scot is ranked at 400-plus.\u0026#8220I think it’s a nonsense I’m not picked but at least I am back in the fold for the home game against Finland.”\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/KMIL2395.JPG.jpg ","title":"local school head tells residents to report parents thoughtless parking to cops","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA head teacher has urged residents to contact the police to report parents who have been posing a danger to pupils by parking illegally outside a Perth primary school.The bid to stop parents parking dangerously and blocking a junction outside Inchview Primary has been backed by local councillor Willie Wilson.Fed-up residents claim “thoughtless and lazy” parents are persistently parking on double yellow lines and they have been taking photos to pass to Police Scotland.One Windsor Terrace resident said: “Some of the parking is absolutely ludicrous.

supporters","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United defender Rachid Bouhenna insists they must repay the fans for their support with a win at Falkirk on Saturday.The French-Algerian centre-back made his United debut in their disappointing 1-1 draw with Morton at Tannadice at the weekend.The Terrors now travel west for a crucial Championship tie after captain Fraser Fyvie, ing from a long-term injury off the bench, salvaged a point with a last-minute strike against Jonatan Johansson’s side – who took an early lead through a Michael Tidser penalty.And Bouhenna says they will do everything they can to pick up three points and get the Arabs back onside ahead of, what he insists is, a continued promotion push.“Of course for Dundee United the objective is to go to the top league, the Premiership, so we have to win these games at home and get results away,” he said.“Saturday we lost two points, we need to win the supporters back this weekend at Falkirk and I hope next year we will play in the top tier.“The fans were amazing, we need them for the rest of the season and I think they are behind us.“After the game I thought it was a good game but we had many chances to score and didn’t take them.“It’s good to come back to draw but for the next game we have to win  we want to stay near the top of the Championship.”Despite hauling down Gregor Buchanan for the penalty which Tidser converted to give the Ton the lead on 11 minutes, Bouhenna was pleased with his first run-out in tangerine.However, The 27-year-old was not happy with referee Colin Steven’s call to award the spot-kick after the tussle with Buchanan at a corner and Bouhenna expressed his surprise given the physical nature of Scottish football.He added: “It was an OK debut I think.“Only really the foul for the penalty – I can’t believe it.“I don’t think it was, he did not have the ball and we are in a duel but I don’t know why.“It was not just the penalty, it was every ball the referee whistle against us.“It is not like Algeria or France, for sure.“It is more physical but Morton was a very physical game – that is the big dference and I think we can play more football at home.“Away it will be very dficult, you saw in the last game at Alloa you can’t play because of a dficult pitch but at home we have to play more.“Next game it will be very dficult when we play against Falkirk, so we have to get used to this.”Bouhenna is still settling into le in Dundee and getting to grips with the language – not to mention the accent.However, he still feels at home after being welcomed by everyone at the club.Skipper Fyvie, in particular, impressed the big defender with his influence on the side when he entered the fray on 73 minutes.The 25-year-old changed the game and got the equaliser with a ferocious half volley in second-half stoppage time.“Fraser has the experience, when he come on to pitch he helped us.“He is good for us and I hope in the next game he can continue to help us  he is in the starting XI or comes on to the pitch.“I am enjoying being at Dundee United, I am feeling very good.“My team-mates and everybody at the club have been very nice, they feel like family and I am very happy with it.“With the manager and the team-mates it is very good but we have to keep going, keep working and think about the next

council","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBus services linking several communities throughout Dundee could soon be a reality under new plans from the city council.The local authority has posted a new tender on Scotland’s public contracts forum worth £360,000 and is accepting bids from bus companies to run two new subsidised services.Draft timetables suggest one route would run hourly, clockwise and anti-clockwise, from 10.30am to 6.30pm on Sundays, and 6.30pm through to 11pm for the rest of the week.Subsidised services are often funded by local authorities when the routes are needed, especially by elderly people, but have little commercial benefit and hence are often overlooked by private firms.The subsidised service will run for one year, and could be extended for up to three years, and the contract stipulates that a bus with a minimum of 21 seats is needed.One of the routes covers Ninewells, Charleston, Menzieshill, Ardler, Kirkton, Fintry, Whitfield, Douglas and the Ferry.The other follows a route similar to the 9 and 10 services operated by Xplore Dundee, running along the southern edge of the city before cutting through the Technology Park and following the same route as the other service.Earlier this year, Xplore announced a number of changes were set to affect the 9 and 10 – including cutting the Technology Park from the routes.It is thought these subsidised routes could be a response to the changes – which are yet to come into effect – in an attempt by Dundee City Council to minimise disruption to passengers.Dorothy McHugh, secretary for Dundee Pensioners’ Forum, said: “We wonder whether this new proposal is in response to Xplore’s planned changes – but we understood that Xplore had postponed making these changes until a new consultation has taken place at the start of next year.“We are trying to get clarication on this from the city council.”Linda Groat, who lives just off the western edge of Perth Road and has previously criticised changes to bus routes in her area, says the proposed subsidy routes “do not go far enough”.Linda, 51, who has multiple sclerosis, said: “We used to have services like the 5 and the Stagecoach 16 pass by here but now there’s nothing.“I can’t bring home shopping or anything because the nearest stop is a third of a mile away and I can’t carry bags that distance.“Why a service can’t pick us up, even to let us change at Ninewells, I don’t know, it would give them extra fares. It’s like we’ve been shunned.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"storm ali strong winds blow caravan with woman inside off cliff","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA caravan has blown off a clf with a woman inside as high winds from Storm Ali batter the west of Ireland.THIS STORY HAS BEEN UPDATEDPolice and emergency services are at the scene.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0027 historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0027 committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0027 financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0027 a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 11:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117524.jpg","title":"Black Isle riders go the distance","story":"\u0026nbspPLANS to develop top-notch all-weather sports facilities in a Black Isle village took a step forward last week when 25 riders saddled up in Avoch for a 50-mile ride around the peninsula.The Vuelta de Isla Negra \u0026mdash translated as cycle around the Black Isle \u0026mdash was inspired by a Spanish event which takes place at the same time and saw members of the business community team up to chase a \u0026pound300,000 fundraising target for the facilities in Avoch.Law firm Ledingham Chalmers, which has offices in Inverness, Aberdeen, Stirling and Edinburgh, staged the event on Friday in support of Avoch Amenities Association\u0027 bid to transform an old bowling green into tennis and all-weather multi-sports courts with changing facilities.Senior associate Roddy Cormack came up with the idea for the event last year.

They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 11:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

Scotland squad.“He came bouncing through the door after coming back from international duty.“Although he didn’t play against Albania, which was a brilliant result, he was involved in the training and preparation for that. And he came on against Belgium.“All those little bits of experience being away with the Scotland squad can only help in the future for Graeme.“For me he has taken a big step forward from the games in the close season when they went to Peru and Mexico.“What he’s done now is let the manager know his abilities.“If Graeme keeps up his level of performance for us I am hopeful, and I am sure, he will be involved in future Scotland squads.“We are hoping he can be at the heart of that over the next period of time.“Sometimes you have to wait for starts but I have no doubt he is good enough to go on and do that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"weir is third inductee to aberdeen hall of fame 2018","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen legend Peter Weir is the third member of the Hall of Fame class of 2018.Weir, 60, who was part of the Reds team which beat Real Madrid to the European Cup Winners\u0026#8217 Cup in 1983, made 237 appearances over seven years and scored 38 goals.Signed from St Mirren by Sir Alex Ferguson in 1981, he was also pivotal in the Super Cup win over German side Hamburg, as well as the 3-1 UEFA Cup win over English top-flight Ipswich Town at Pittodrie.He left the Dons for Leicester City in 1988.Weir said: “It was a dream playing for your local side St Mirren then getting a big move to a club you had supported.\u0026#8220It was great to have won many honours with Aberdeen and also being capped by Jock Stein –six times – playing for your country.

Chris, 33, of the city centre, who will finish the project this week, said: “Part of it was because of the nature of my work, it’s quite easy for me to spend an entire day without leaving the building.“It was partly because I wanted an excuse to leave the house and speak to another human being every day.“Beyond that, I didn’t really have any objectives.”Most of the people he met were in Aberdeen, and two thirds of the people who were photographed had volunteered to take part. He said: “There were a couple of times I had to chase people down the street saying ‘excuse me’.“I started off with friends and family and former colleagues, but people started coming to me.“The vast majority have been people who have approached me.“There’s no way I would have been able to do it myself just having to approach people in the street.“It ended up being a snowball effect.“The idea of doing a picture a day is not something I dreamed up, it’s something a lot of photographers do.” Working as a wedding photographer, Chris often has to work with a backdrop that is outwith his control, so the project allowed him to look at dferent technical aspects while fuelling his love for portrait photography.He said: “It ties in with my interests. I like taking pictures of people.“Taking a picture of a dferent person every day meant I couldn’t fall back on the same people every day. I’ve allowed myself a bit of flexibility as well.”Although two thirds of his portraits ended up being volunteers, it wasn’t always easy to get people to take part.Chris likened the process to the famine and the feast, and said there were times he struggled to get back to people in time and others when he had only six hours left to find someone.With the end of the project nearing, he will be relaxing for a bit, but hopes to continue on the project in the future.He added: “I definitely want to keep doing something. Who knows, maybe in three months’ time.”There will be an exhibition held at Foodstory, which will begin in early October, upstairs in the cafe.To view the project, visit www.instagram/chrshndrsn.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"every picture taken for aberdeen photographers instagram portrait project","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEvery day for the last year Aberdeen photographer Chris Henderson has captured a portrait a day \u0026#8211 here we show every single picture taken so far.Daily lives explored as Aberdeen photographer goes face to face for year-long Instagram project\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/daily-lives-explored-as-aberdeen-photographer-goes-face-to-face-for-year-long-portrait-project/embed/#?secret=jpVp6MTMOo\" data-secret=\"jpVp6MTMOo\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Daily lives explored as Aberdeen photographer goes face to face for year-long Instagram project\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"new plans to revamp aberdeen market and former bhs store","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen\u0026#8217s indoor market and former BHS store could be transformed under new plans.Rockspring, which owns the buildings, said it is “seeking a new and viable approach to the redevelopment of the site” and that its plans include “more attractive and active frontages\u0026#8230 to increase the vibrancy of the area”.The company wants to “dramatically improve the external facade” of the building.It said it has been in discussions with Aberdeen City Council regarding options since the collapse of BHS and has now submitted a proposal of application notice.The new development would include retail on Union Street, plus cafes and restaurants on Market Street and The Green, and office space.Shaun Hose, director of Rockspring, said: “The location and scale of this site presents major regeneration opportunities for Aberdeen city centre.“Our aim is to create an innovative architectural building and greatly improve the surroundings.“The approach to design and development will be fundamental in terms of creating a successful piece of urban design, sadly lacking in the current building which is no longer fit for purpose.”A spokeswoman for the firm said the current building “has been deteriorating for some time” and is not suited for current “shopping trends”.Mr Hose added: “This will transform the current eyesore into a more attractive and contemporary focal point for the Merchant Quarter, in keeping with the improvements which have been made to The Green in recent years.“Working closely with the council and in consultation with local stakeholders and the wider public, we want to come up with a proposal that fits with the City Centre Masterplan but also responds to market demand for smaller, more erse retail and leisure outlets and office space.“Ultimately, it’s about offering a long-term, sustainable solution for the site that enhances the vitality of the east end of Union Street.”The firm is planning a “comprehensive consultation exercise” in November to gather public views.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"two year old north east beauty pageant contestant raises 700 for charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA young pageant contestant has helped raise £700 for charity.New Deer two-year-old Amelia Cardno  ho is vying to be a pageant queen at Miss United Elite Scotland in March next year, held a fun day at Aden Country Park.Mum Caprice Clark, 20, organised the day, which raised the cash for the Scottish Association of Mental Health.Caprice said: “Mental health is something that affects everyone at one point or another, so we just thought that we could put on a little fun day, maybe raise a couple of hundred pounds.“I didn’t think that it would go as well as it did, but we counted up at the end of the day and we had raised just over £700, I was absolutely thrilled.”Amelia was the star of the show at the fun day, held last month, according to Caprice.

If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item  they are not at home when we deliver.

Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly dferent in this edition.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hospice benefits from heavy metal roadshow","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/09/18, 7:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCowal Vintage Transport Club held its charity road run on Saturday September 1, with guests from as far afield as Kintyre, Dunblane and the Borders joining in.A colourful procession of vintage tractors, cars and motorcycles and an old MacBrayne\u0026#8217s bus left Sandbank on the Holy Loch, winding its way across the Cowal peninsula to Otter Ferry, before hugging the Loch Fyne shore northwards to Strathlachlan.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust. The next championships will be held at Inveralmond Community High School, Livingston, on Sunday March 10 2019.More details are on our website \u0026#8211 www.thechampionships.Last March, 145 schools from Scotland and two from England were represented at the championships, with a category for all standards of playing.Five years ago we introduced a new category of \u0026#8216freestyle\u0026#8217.  The aim of this is to provide an opportunity for schools to showcase their other musical skills alongside those of their pipers.The Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust  hopes many young pipers and drummers from Mid Argyll \u0026#8211 with other musicians too  entering the freestyle event – will participate in next year’s championships.Patrick Gascoigne, administrator, Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"achnaba blackie lambs win james weir trophy","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/09/18, 6:51 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowUnited Auctions held its annual Dalmally show and sale of blackface wedder lambs, sponsored by the Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association, on Saturday September 8.Including all classes of cross bred lambs and feeding sheep there was a catalogued entry of 8,002 of lambs and sheep, selling to a packed ringside of buyers.William Dunlop of Elmscleugh judged the ious classes of blackface lambs and his awards are as follows:  First and champion pen, taking the James Weir Memorial Trophy – Achnaba \u0026#8211 £58.In second place was Tullochan \u0026#8211 £51 and third Tayvallich Estate \u0026#8211 £45.50.In line with other centres lambs were weighing two to three kg lighter on the year.

MTV have launched a new channel - Club MTV - that films at the best clubs across the country. Now Furys has been selected as one of the elite for broadcast. MTV will provide a DJ for the night and all revellers have to do is turn up and get their groove on. Furys manager Steven Muir said: “MTV are doing a freshers’ tour for filming and they asked  we want to be part of it. “They were targeting big university cities and some towns. “They picked us as they had seen we won the nightclub award and UWS had grown in stature.” Steven said Furys is getting bigger and better and they are delighted to be selected as one of the clubs to be filmed.  He added: “MTV film the night and it will be aired later on in the spring on the Club MTV chance. “This is the people of Ayr’s chance to get on TV, so what we have done is ask that people come dressed smart and show off the town. “It will just be a normal night in Furys, and they asked to do it on one of our iconic nights. “So Skints on a Thursday was chosen, as that’s a busy night for students and has been running for about 10 years. “We sold out all the booths within a few hours of advertising, and the tickets are flying off the shelves. “I am advising everyone to get tickets soon, as this will no doubt be a full house.” The event occurs on Thursday, October 4 at Furys Nightclub on Nile Court. Tickets are available starting at \u0026pound7, and can be bought from http:skiddle/e/13307619. For any more information, contacts Furys on their Facebook page.

Karen Wylie, 39, is hoping to raise \u0026pound80,000 to fly son Saul - who suffers from Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy - to America for surgery which will allow him to stand independently and potentially walk. The Post reported earlier this year on the family’s campaign to help Saul whose condition causes muscle stfness in his legs and arms, meaning he cannot stand or walk unaided. The family, from Tarbolton, are fundraising so they can travel the 4000 miles to Missouri for a spinal operation which would dramatically reduce Saul’s spasticity. They hope to take Saul to St Louis Children’s Hospital to see Dr TS Park, a pioneer in Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy  surgery. Karen said: “Our objective is to get Saul to the best possible stage to allow us to apply to St Louis Children’s Hospital for him to be evaluated for this le-changing surgery. This will involve intense physiotherapy blocks, the purchase of specialised equipment and working closely with ious professional therapists to get him strong enough. This will take some time but no dream will ever be too big for our boy, it might just take a little longer to get there.” Saul was born with twin brother Clay 12 weeks’ premature. Clay weighed 3lbs and Saul just 1lb. Clay was treated at Crosshouse Hospital near Kilmarnock for three months to allow his lungs to develop and learn to feed and has now made a full recovery. However, Saul was kept in Yorkhill Hospital for six months and spent most of his first year in hospital as he was so fragile. At 18 months old, he was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy. When Karen was pregnant with the twins, she and her husband Stuart were given the devastating news that Clay had a better chance of survival  Saul were to be terminated, something that was never option for them. Karen said: “We were told on several occasions that Saul was too tiny to survive but he continues to defy the experts and he is our little fighter.” Not a keen runner, Karen – who gave up work when the twins were born and cares for Saul on a full-time basis – is taking on the 10k with a group of 25 friends and her 66-year-old mum in order to raise the \u0026pound80,000 needed to take Saul to America. Karen said: “I am not a runner, but have been training three times a week for the event and can now manage to run 4.5 miles. My mum has never done anything like this before so is extremely nervous but very determined to complete the race for her grandson. “Our fundraising total is set at \u0026pound80,000 to cover my son’s surgery, specialised equipment, intense physio and a two- year rehabilitation programme. We have been campaigning for 18 weeks and have raised an incredible \u0026pound41,000 so far. “We have been overwhelmed by the kindness of friends and family who are willing to help raise funds for Saul’s journey, their generosity is very much appreciated and our family are exceedingly grateful to everyone who’s helped us on this journey. “We were extremely proud when Saul started school with his twin Clay and older brother Mylo, eight, this year. He attends Tarbolton Primary School and has several classroom assistants who support him depending on what activities are being done each day. “Like every parent we long for endless opportunities for our son. We are exceedingly grateful to everyone who has supported us on Saul’s journey to help make his dream come true – to walk like his brothers.” The run is on Sunday, September 30.

He spent time in the Territorial Army which took him south to London for a stint guarding Her Majesty. Mason recalls: “He got to be involved in some pretty exciting things by all accounts. “He was on duty for the state visit of Nelson Mandela and because of his work I was born down in London.”  But the former car salesman, who served Arnold Clark Toyota in Ayr and Kilmarnock, would become renowned for his service to Ayr Boswell. Mason said: “He set up the 1997s team with Stevie Devlin and brought through so many kids, myself included. “We’ll have so many memories - as diehard Ayr fans we loved going to Somerset Park. “It’s no coincidence that the last game we went to together was when we beat Killie and our picture ended up on the back page of the Ayrshire Post! “He was my dad, best mate and coach all in one.” A fundraiser of former Boswell players raised more than \u0026pound8000 at Dam Park this summer.

the medical needs of Selkirk from 1867-1928, becoming one of the local community\u0026rsquos most respected and well-loved figures.\nNot only was he a keen cyclist, he kept a meticulous record of his family le and his day-to-day dealings with the public in a series of diaries.\nIn 2014, some 40 of Dr Muir\u0026rsquos diaries were presented by his descendants to the Scottish Borders Archive \u0026amp Local History Service, and these were then transcribed by staff at Hawick\u0026rsquos Heritage Hub.\nTwo years later, at the request of Live Borders, Selkirk playwright and actor John Nichol used material from the diaries as the basis for his one-man, one-act play, Dr John Stewart Muir: The Beloved Doctor.\nTaking the title role himself, John\u0026rsquos play received a rapturous reception at its premiere in the town\u0026rsquos County Hotel in February, 2017.\nOne scene features Dr Muir recounting an ambitious cycle ride he took to Moffat in 1916, ing via Boreland,

delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken signicant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters

local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum.

championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.

Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.

The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.

She may talk to other leaders in the margins of the summit in an effort to win backing for a plan which has met fierce resistance from within the ranks of her own Conservative Party.  As part of the drive to set out the UK\u0026rsquos position to the EU\u0026rsquos leaders, Mrs May used an article in German newspaper Die Welt to explain her stance.  \u0026ldquoA lot has been said about what the UK is asking for, so I want people to hear directly from me about what I am trying to achieve and the motivation behind it, she said.  The Chequers blueprint \u0026ndash a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook for trade in goods\u0026nbspand \u0026ldquobusiness-friendly facilitated customs arrangement \u0026ndash is the only way to resolve the thorny issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, she said.  \u0026ldquoIt is profoundly in both sides\u0026rsquo economic interest, it respects the integrity of the single market and, crucially, no one else has come up with a proposal that could command cross-community support in Northern Ireland that is the only true foundation for stability there.  The Government argues Brussels\u0026rsquo plan, which would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union until a new arrangement could be agreed, would effectively create a border between the North and the rest of the UK \u0026ndash something the Prime Minister has said she could not accept.  Mrs May said: \u0026ldquoTo come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same.  \u0026ldquoNeither side can demand the unacceptable of the other, such as an external customs border between dferent parts of the United Kingdom \u0026ndash which no other country would accept  they were in the same situation \u0026ndash or the UK seeking the rights of EU membership without the obligations.

Some 17,000 homes were built across Britain in 1920/21, jumping quickly to 110,000 in 1921/22. Housing was a big concern for Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George, who had campaigned on the slogan of building homes \u0026ldquofit for heroes.  \u0026ndash The scale of building fluctuated over the next two decades, peaking in 1938/39, when 122,000 new council houses were completed, but the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 brought building almost to a halt.  \u0026ndash It was not until 1946 that major construction began again, hitting 168,780 in 1949. Between then and 1978, the total number of new council homes completed each year in the UK never fell below 100,000.  \u0026ndash Construction was particularly high during the 1950s. In 1953 almost a quarter of a million new council homes  were completed \u0026ndash the highest number for any one year since records began. This was a period when successive Conservative prime ministers Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan made housebuilding a priority of their governments.  \u0026ndash Council house building fell dramatically from 1979 onwards. This was a consequence of changes introduced by Conservative governments led by Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Councils were redesignated as \u0026ldquoenablers working with housing associations to deliver accommodation, rather than \u0026ldquoproviders. Council tenants were given the chance to purchase their own homes under the Right to Buy scheme, which reduced the stock of council housing. Councils were allowed to keep only a portion of the income from these sales.  \u0026ndash The number of newly built council houses fell from 88,530 in 1980 to 17,710 in 1990. The decline accelerated in the next two decades, hitting a low of just 130 in 2004. By comparison, in 2004 20,660 new homes were completed by housing associations, while 182,700 were completed by private firms.  \u0026ndash In recent years housebuilding by local authorities has picked up again. In 2017 a provisional total of 3,280 were built by councils across the UK. But this was still only 1.7% of the total new homes completed in the UK in 2017, with 16.6% built by housing associations and 81.7% privately."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8262492.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"holyrood-expected-to-vote-against-standard-assessments-for-p1-children","story":"  MSPs at the Scottish Parliament are expected to back a Tory motion calling on ministers to halt the use of tests for the youngest students.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-the-tories-are-snatching-away-hope-from-the-children-who-need-it-most","story":"  In its 2016 Holyrood manesto, they welcomed \u0026ldquothe Scottish Government\u0026rsquos recent decision to reintroduce national testing in primary schools.

Parents are being tormented by two-faced politicians deploying scare tactics about the education of their children. This is not debate, this is double-dealing of the worst order. Sadly, it has been this way for a long time.  From the issue of a Named Person to advocate for young people who might not have the support they need, through to baby boxes, free tuition fees for university students, the smacking ban and now national testing for primary school pupils, you would be forgiven \u0026ndash  you listened to the opponents of the Scottish Government \u0026ndash for thinking that Nicola Sturgeon is the witch from Hansel and Gretel, ready to eat any child who passes her cottage at Bute House made of social democratic gingerbread.

But these days, it is often the crazy not the considerate who win the day.

Now, of course, you could dismiss Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos comments as political spin \u0026ndash but, I think, he\u0026rsquos telling the truth. Actions speak louder than words, and those policies listed above \u0026ndash the Named Person, baby boxes, the smacking ban, free tuition, national testing \u0026ndash are all saying the same thing to the electorate: we are trying to do the best by your kids. Trying does not mean succeeding, but at least they\u0026rsquore trying.  There\u0026rsquos plenty I disagree with the SNP about, but when it comes to the broad spectrum of policies intended to improve the lives of children, I believe it has the best intentions at heart. And it is trying its best because at the heart of our education system lies a very real problem that the party has to take responsibility for: the struggle to close the attainment gap between children from middle class backgrounds and those from low income homes.  Disadvantaged pupils achieve around half the qualications that the most affluent achieve \u0026ndash that is a failure, especially for a social democratic party.  The opponents of the SNP, chiefly led by the Tories, picked up the attainment problem as a cudgel, and, rightly, beat the SNP over the head with it. As a result, the SNP, rightly, tried to enact policies to close the attainment gap, including national testing \u0026hellip which the Tories supported, but now don\u0026rsquot support, because, like always, what the Tories care about is power and point-scoring not policies which help the worse off in society.  Let\u0026rsquos concentrate, however, on testing in primary schools \u0026ndash intended, obviously, to help monitor failings in attainment so they can be addressed as early as possible. We\u0026rsquore told that the tests are \u0026ldquotraumatising children \u0026ndash especially those in Primary One.  This is embarrassing nonsense. I know plenty of teachers \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquom married to one \u0026ndash and not a single teacher I\u0026rsquove spoken to thinks the tests are traumatising. In fact, they laugh when they hear that. They may not like the tests, they may think they\u0026rsquore pointless, that it adds to an already huge workload \u0026ndash but trauma? Come off it, they say.  Children don\u0026rsquot have to prepare for the tests. The tests are done on iPads so it doesn\u0026rsquot feel like some scary pen and paper assessment. The tests are also \u0026ldquoadaptive which means that  the child is having trouble answering questions then it becomes easier, and  the child is doing well the questions become harder. The tests don\u0026rsquot last long - in P1 it\u0026rsquoll take no longer that 30 minutes once a year.  Some teachers feel the \u0026ldquomumsnet brigade \u0026ndash sharp-elbowed middle-class parents who want to wrap their children in cotton wool \u0026ndash hate the tests because it means their little princes and princesses might not come out with gold stars and A-pluses. What horror \u0026ndash their child might be average.  There are also concerns that it\u0026rsquos these parents who are creating the climate of fear around the tests: tell your child something is scary and the child will find it scary allow the child to do the test without inculcating fear and they\u0026rsquoll see nothing to fear.  So it is within a climate of hypocrisy, fear and falsehood that we are now to see a debate and vote on national testing in primary one, orchestrated by the Tories, which the SNP, according to political insiders, is likely to lose. The Tories have created enough chaos  to block a policy they supported until it became political convenient not to.  We\u0026rsquore going to see a policy \u0026ndash albeit flawed in many eyes, but well-intentioned and crafted to deal with one of society\u0026rsquos biggest problems \u0026ndash sacriced on the altar of political conniving. A chance to do something meaningful in schools when it comes to the education of children will likely be snuffed out.  If there\u0026rsquos any kind of fairy tale metaphor here, it isn\u0026rsquot wicked witch Sturgeon coming to gobble up your children, it\u0026rsquos the Pinocchio-nosed Tory party snatching hope away from children who need it, and locking up opportunity in a high tower that only the wealthy have the keys to, not the poorest."},{"url":null,"title":"minister-to-be-quizzed-on-45m-loan-to-sturgeon-advisers-firm","story":"  The Scottish Tories have tabled an urgent question about the taxpayer funds - some given in secret - going to Ferguson Marine Engineering, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde.

The SNP said the \u0026lsquoWin Win\u0026rsquo report on the benefits of the UK, released to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the No vote in 2014 referendum, was \u0026ldquoludicrously over the top.

Mr Kilgour said the question mark over another independence vote was deterring business investment in Scotland and hurting the economy.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur report shows that a second referendum on independence for Scotland will be eight times more damaging than a worse case Brexit scenario to the Scottish economy, and that is a reality that no-one operating in businesses across Scotland could afford to come to fruition.

Labour Jackie Baillie MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis is yet more evidence of how damaging independence would be to our economy.  \"As the SNP itself admitted in its cuts commission, independence would mean decades of austerity, tax rises and massive reductions in public spending.  \"That is not what the people of Scotland need or want.  \"Nicola Sturgeon needs to stop putting nationalism before the NHS, schools and jobs.\"  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThese claims are so ludicrously over the top they show just how rattled the Tories are - they know support for independence has never been so consistently high or sustained, and that Brexit may well be the point of no .  ?\"Leaving the EU and a single market eight times bigger than the UK\u0027s alone threatens to be disastrous for Scotland - and the shambolic no-deal outcome the Tories are now preparing for would be utterly catastrophic.  ?\"Scotland is already one of the most productive parts of the UK outside London, with resources few countries can match, and independence would allow us to make the most of that huge potential.\""},{"url":null,"title":"cbi-joins-criticism-of-scottish-business-rates-levy","story":"  The CBI said plans to let councils levy a new charge on out-of-town stores and online retailer warehouses, such as those of Amazon, would deter investment and damage the economy.  The organisation, whose members employ 500,000 Scots, also said the levy would not work as a \u0026ldquounilateral measure in the global drive to tax the digital economy more effectively.  The out-of-town supplement, which is due to be piloted from 2020, is part of a suite of reforms to the business rates system instigated by last year\u0026rsquos Barclay Review.  The CBI welcomed a series of other measures in the Barclay Review, including more reliefs for new businesses, three-year revaluations, and greater transparency.  However it was scathing about the out-of-town levy, which the Barclay Review said should be \"modest\", set by inidual councils and used to help support struggling town centres.  The Scottish Retail Consortium has also strongly criticised the idea.  Calling for the plan to be abandoned, the CBI said the extra charge would hit a cross section of employers, such as garden centres, supermarkets and car dealerships, many of them already paying a separate supplement linked to their large size.  In a submission to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos consultation on the out-of-town charge, the CBI said: \u0026ldquoThe issue of taxation in the new digital economy is being debated across the world\u0026rsquos developed economies with the OECD , the EU and the UK government attempting to find multilateral and unilateral solutions for how to tax global online business.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish government will not be able to unilaterally address such complex issues by giving local councils the ability to impose an additional levy.  \u0026ldquoWhat an additional levy would do is hit a range of local businesses across Scotland that are doing their best to contribute to their local economies.  It said  ministers went ahead with the plan, there should be a range of safeguards including a \u0026ldquostatutory cap, clarity on how the money would be spent, and consultation with business.  CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: \u0026ldquoBusiness rates have been a bone of contention for far too long. While the Scottish Government should be applauded for taking action to remedy the situation, there\u0026rsquos still some way to go to build a regime that fits the Barclay Review\u0026rsquos goal of supporting business growth and long-term investment.  \u0026ldquoWhile we\u0026rsquore very sympathetic to the plight of high streets up and down the country, clobbering vital employers with a triple tax whammy is not the solution \u0026ndash instead we need smart, creative and sustainable proposals that revive local communities through increased economic activity. The idea for an out-of-town levy is a non-starter and the proposal should be scrapped immediately.  The Scottish Retail Consortium has called the out-of-town surcharge \u0026ldquoill-considered and poorly timed, and would add to the complexity of an already complicated system.  The Chartered Institute of Taxation said the levy should help the rates regime better reflect local priorities but was likely to be a \u0026ldquobureaucratic burden for already stretched councils.  A Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the consultation we launched in June, we are now seeking views on allowing up to three local councils to introduce pilot schemes in which businesses based predominantly online or out-of-town might be charged a modest business rates supplement.  \u0026ldquoThe proceeds from this supplement would be used to support rates relief for businesses in town centres and we are consulting on a range of appropriate safeguards, such as the need for consultation with all rate-payers who might potentially be affected.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that the consultation is as wide-ranging as possible and we would encourage all those with concerns or comments about the current business rates system to take part."},{"url":null,"title":"conference-sketch-corbyns-pants-mays-rubbish-and-the-lib-dems-wonderful","story":"  It could only be the Gospel according to St Nick. The onetime Deputy Prime Minister flew on angel wings to the conference fringe of the day.  Calamity can still draw the yellow faithful. A larger room had to be organised to accommodate the Clegg worshippers, clapping and cheering at their fallen hero, who unexpectedly lost his Sheffield seat in the 2017 snap poll.  Prof Clegg insisted he disagreed with Jo Swinson - never a wise move - who had cast doubt on some of the decisions of the Age of Stability that was the Lib-Con coalition.  St Nick puffed out his chest and insisted he was \u0026ldquoproud of his record in government, including \u0026ldquomassively reining in some of the darker Tory excesses.

Part of the reason for that is that childbirth, in all its bone-wrenching, bloody glory, just is traumatic, but part is that I, as an educated 30-something, was so utterly unprepared for what would happen to me.  Sure, I\u0026rsquod seen One Born Every Minute and listened to a candid friend\u0026rsquos memory of being \u0026ldquoaxed in half in the delivery room, but ultimately I must have been influenced by the dominant narrative around childbirth that always ends with the mother, hair and make-up intact, sitting up in bed \u0026ldquodoing just fine while looking lovingly at her progeny. To say that the reality came as a shock would be the understatement of the decade.  It is obviously impossible for me to say whether being better informed pre-birth would have made the actual experience any better for me, but the aversion to telling women the truth about childbirth \u0026ndash or at least to empowering women to tell their own truths about giving birth \u0026ndash is nonetheless troubling.  That there is an aversion was highlighted last week when a speech given at the British Science Festival by a Hull University lecturer received widespread media coverage. Having been asked to investigate tocophobia \u0026ndash an unreasonable dread of childbirth \u0026ndash by her local NHS, Catriona Jones said she had found that by using websites like Mumsnet to share their experiences of how traumatic childbirth can be, women are contributing to a climate of fear that is negatively impacting on other women.  \u0026ldquoIf you go online and you go into any of the Mumsnet forums there are women telling their stories of childbirth, and it was terrible, it was a bloodbath, and that can be quite frightening for women to engage with, she was widely quoted as saying.  This was seized on by the media, which to some extent demonised Mumsnet and the women who share their experiences on it. The problem is, that while these reports accurately reflected Ms Jones\u0026rsquos words, they failed to tell the whole story, with just one newspaper \u0026ndash The  \u0026ndash noting that she had also warned that cuts to antenatal services were resulting in women being less prepared for childbirth than they used to be.  \u0026ldquoPreviously, that article paraphrased Ms Jones as saying, \u0026ldquowomen would be shown around delivery rooms in the weeks before the birth but most maternity wards are now too busy.  But  the real story is that an overstretched and underfunded health service is failing to prepare women for childbirth, and that in turn is compounding their negative experience of birth, why did the narrative around the research universally become one of women terrying other women, creating an added burden for the NHS in the process? Why are we so keen to cast women as problematic rather than acknowledging they have valid stories to tell?  The obvious answer is that a media controlled by men at best fails to recognise, and at worst seeks to distort or ignore, narratives that have women and women\u0026rsquos experiences at their core. As at least some of the reports on Ms Jones\u0026rsquos comments were written by women, though, the truth is more troubling even than that, with a deep-seated societal refusal to hear women\u0026rsquos voices likely to blame.  Indeed, as has long been highlighted by the classicist Mary Beard \u0026ndash a scholar who endures endless misogynistic abuse because she tells the stories of the women airbrushed from history \u0026ndash even in the earliest written evidence of western culture \u0026ldquowomen\u0026rsquos voices are not being heard in the public sphere.  Yet the importance of hearing those voices cannot be overstated. While the unconditional support of my partner and wider family were crucial for my post-partum recovery, there is no way I\u0026rsquod have been able to come to terms with the birth experience, or get through the waking, the feeding, the worrying \u0026ndash the endless, endless worrying \u0026ndash without the company of complete strangers who at that very moment were going through exactly the same thing as me.  It was thanks to the many, many hours spent reading Mumsnet threads on everything from induction and labour to lochia and tongue-tie that I realised that everything I had just experienced was totally normal and I wasn\u0026rsquot someone for whom things had gone badly wrong. The psychological impact of that was profound.  Far from silencing women\u0026rsquos voices and ignoring the stories that have shaped their experience for centuries, we should be doing more to ensure those stories are heard. Only then can the actual cause of problems such as tocophobia be addressed and the horric can become less horrying. Websites like Mumsnet, which give women the opportunity to finally share their experiences in a public forum, are part of that solution."},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-review-benidorm-live-playhouse-edinburgh-four-stars","story":"  Benidorm Live  The Playhouse, Edinburgh  Neil Cooper, four stars  The sun looks like setting on the Solana Hotel at the start of Derren Litten\u0026rsquos end-of-the-pier adaptation of his phenomenally successful Brits-abroad sitcom.

The SNP said devolving migration was vital to counter the UK government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquohostile \u0026lsquoLittle Britain approach to the issue and to Brexit.  In a long-awaited report on European migration, the MAC said there should be no special preference given to EU workers coming to the UK after Brexit.  It also said there was no evidence that increased EU migration had damaged le in the UK.  It concluded that EU migrants paid more in tax than they took in benefits, contributed more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they accessed, and had no effect on crime rates.  It called on the UK government to make it easier for high-skilled workers to migrate to the UK, and called for no limit to the number of highly-skilled workers allowed in each year.  This is currently capped at 20,700 from non-EU countries.  Despite the SNP arguing for Holyrood to control migration to offset the impact of Brexit, the MAC report said it was not necessary.  It did not opine on whether migration should be devolved or stay reserved - saying that was a political decision - but it did say there was no underlying economic need for it.  It said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government take the view that EU migration to Scotland is essential for preventing a  to population decline, to offset the ageing of the existing population and to support remote communities.  \u0026ldquoAlthough lower migration might lead to population decline, this problem is not something that starts at the Scottish border, some Northern English regions have similar prospects.  \u0026ldquoMigration is much less effective at dealing with a rising old age dependency ratio than increases in the pension age and immigration may not be an effective strategy for sustaining remote communities unless the reasons for locals leaving are addressed.  \u0026ldquoOverall, we were not of the view that Scotland\u0026rsquos economic situation is sufficiently dferent from that of the rest of the UK to justy a very dferent migration policy.  Tory MSP Adam Tomkins said politically-driven SNP demands for devolved migration were \u0026ldquoentirely unnecessaryand potentially damaging.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe report identies that Scotland\u0026rsquos demographic needs are similar to the rest of the UK and might not be best solved by immigration alone. The fact that a separate Scottish immigration policy may also require a border at Berwick is simply another reason why the SNP must abandon their policy for a separate immigration policy.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie added: \u0026ldquoScotland faces the twin challenges of an ageing population and key worker shortages. But these problems are not unique to us.  \u0026ldquoAreas of England, Wales and Northern Ireland share our population trends and need for agricultural workers, NHS and social care staff. \"This debate needs to be fought UK wide. Cutting ourselves off and looking at this issue in isolation isn\u0026rsquot the smartest way to solve it.  Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs select committee, said the report was \u0026ldquovery puzzling, with \u0026ldquosignicant gapsin its analysis and recommendations.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe MAC admit they have ignored the crucial relationship between immigration and trade, and explicitly made no recommendation on whether immigration should be part of the [Brexit] negotiations. This report still leaves a serious gap in the evidence base.  Scottish Chambers of Commerce boss Liz Cameron said employers would welcome an end to the cap on high-skilled migrants, but would dislike the idea of more charges for them.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt seems counter-intuitive to create further barriers to skilled migration. Any future scheme must provide a streamlined experience for both migrants and firms, while relentlessly seeking to remove bureaucracy and red tape.  Mike Cherry of the Federation of Small Businesses also said the MAC report was a concern, as some of its plans would add to the costs and administrative burden on employers.  SNP migration minister Ben Macpherson told MSPs the report was deeply disappointing.  He said: \u0026ldquoWith all of our population increase to come from migration over the next 25 years, migration is absolutely critical to Scotland\u0026rsquos future prosperity.  \u0026ldquoHowever the MAC report does little to consider Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and instead suggests that increasing the pension age would be a preferential approach to managing demographic change \u0026ndash a completely unsustainable position and one we would reject.  \u0026ldquoThis report will also be deeply disappointing to businesses and employers across Scotland who asked for a simple, low cost approach to migration which took into account the requirements of their sectors."},{"url":null,"title":"relieve-the-gsa-of-the-mackintosh-building-art-experts-suggestion-to-msps","story":"  Currently burnt-out, the Mackintosh Building is still at the heart, and perhaps is the soul, of the art school.  However, should the building, disastrously ruined by fire twice in four years, still be run by the educational institution?  That is the provocative question that will be posed to Members of the Scottish Parliament tomorrow by one of Scotland\u0027s leading Mackintosh experts, the writer and gallerist Roger Billclfe.  Mr Billclfe, a vocal critic of the GSA\u0027s responsibility for, and handling of, the building\u0027s first fire in 2014, has suggested in a submission to MSPs that the GSA should be \"relieved of the responsibility\" of the \u0027Mack\u0027.  He says that by the time the building is rebuilt - which GSA chair Muriel Gray said could take up to six years - it will have not been used as a place of teaching for more than a dozen years.  Billclfe believes that the building should be treated as a \"world class work of art\" and could be used as artist accommodation and for exhibitions.  : The Mackintosh Building will be rebuilt says chair  In the conclusion to his submission he says that, because of the unanswered questions around the 2014 fire, the GSA is \"unfit\" to be a custodian of the building.  Mr Billclfe said: \"Temporary accommodation put in force after the 2014 fire will likely have had to be replaced by more permanent arrangements.  \"This seems to be a suitable time to consider relieving the School of its responsibility for the Mackintosh building - something it is believed to have considered in the 1990s when it offered the building to a government agency - and removing the inherent dangers associated with its occupation by a large body of students.  \"This would remove from the School the apparent burden of running a major \u0026lsquomuseum\u0026rsquo and also satisfy the growing demand for access, particularly after the injection of \u0026pound30m of public, private and charitable donations to restore the building following the 2014 fire.\"  Mr Billclfe, whose latest book is \u0027Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Art of the Four\u0027, believes the Mackintosh Building, consumed in a blaze for which no cause has yet been established, should be rebuilt from the architect\u0027s plans.  : How the Mack will be remade: Muriel Gray interview  The Committee\u0026nbspis also hearing evidence from Eileen Reid, the former head of widening participation at the school, the architect Malcolm Fraser, and Stuart Robertson, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society.  The prospect of the GSA giving up their right to the building appears unlikely.  However, there was much anger expressed after the June fire, and how two blazes could have occurred in four years.  The first fire, in 2014, was sparked by an projector igniting some expanded foam being used by a student for her degree show.  Until the police and fire service investigation into the new blaze is complete and published, observers, the public and alumni are in want of reply to questions over cause and responsibility.  : The new Mack will be paid for by insurance and fund raising  A spokesman for the GSA said: \"The Mackintosh Building was commissioned and designed as an art school and GSA is fully committed to it ing as a working art school.\"  In the Herald on Sunday, the chair of the GSA board, Muriel Gray, was adamant the GSA will restore the Mackintosh Building.  Ms Gray said: \"This time it will be built with such knowledge and expertise that we have learned since 2014.  \"We are resolved that the Mackintosh comes back as a working art school, as a major player, a cultural leader for the city and the Scottish economy.\"  She added: \"Imagine the thrill of saying, \u0027We have an architect for this project: who is it? Charles Rennie Mackintosh.\u0027\"  \"The roads lead back to Mackintosh, absolutely and non-negotiably.  \"As far as we are concerned that decision we made in 2014 has just been interrupted.\"  It has been estimated that the cost could be more than \u0026pound100m, but Ms Gray said she hoped this would be met by insurance and a private funding raising initiative, rather than rely on public funds.  : Mackintosh expert on the rebuild at book festival  The building was insured through an Owner Controlled Insurance Programme .  This was held in the name of the GSA and Kier Construction Scotland Limited, which was in charge of the works at the building.

In his submission, he says the Mack is a world class work of art - and should be henceforth treated as such.  He writes: \u0026ldquoIt would be unthinkable to restore a work of art from the National Galleries, say, and then offer access to it to the person who damaged it in the first place. But this is the scenario  the building is still to be retained by the School of Art on its current basis.  He also calls for a full investigation into the school\u0026rsquos administration at the time of the 2014 fire and subsequent refurbishment.  Billclfe, as others do, believes that the causes and circumstances of the original fire still pose many questions.  There is often anger when there are no quick or ready answers to potent and emotional questions. The world is waiting for the police and fire officers to investigate the ruins of the Mack, to find out what caused or accelerated the blaze this summer. I understand that the current theory is that the fire began in the roof of the east gable of the building, and then spread west and down to the ABC venue.

The statements adds: \"It was also made clear that whilst changes to the scale would be welcomed, recruitment and retention of all teachers needed to be improved and all should receive a 10 per ent pay rise, in addition to any other changes.\"  The moves comes after headteachers described the offer as \u0027cynical and isive\u0027.  The Greens backed the move with education spokesman Ross Greer saying: \"Unions are right to take a stand on teacher pay.  \"It\u0026nbspis misleading for Cosla and the Scottish Government to present this as some kind of unprecedented pay rise when those who would benefit the most will still only make up half the value their wage has lost over the last decade. Many will benefit far less than that.\"  At its AGM in June the Educational Institue of Scotland teaching union voted in favour of escalating to \"strike readiness\" and preparing for a ballot after the summer holidays unless a deal achieving the 10 per cent was reached.  The teachers\u0027 side of the SNCT said negotiations on pay are continuing and a further meeting is set for October 4.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"Teachers\u0027 pay is a matter for the SNCT and negotiations for 2018-19 are continuing.\"  Cosla has urged unions to accept a \u0026pound350 million pay deal for local government workers, warning any increase above the three per cent on offer for those earning up to \u0026pound80,000 would result in cuts to jobs and services.

This compares with children who are ed to their families, who spend an average of nine months away from home.  Academics at the university, and at the Universities of York and Lancaster, tracked the progress children aged under five, who had been taken into care in 2012-13. Of 1,836 children covered by the study, 481 wer looked after at home with their parents, supervised by social work. Meanwhile 1,355 were placed with family members, foster carers or prospective adoptive parents.  After four years, of those removed from home, 31 per cent had been ed to their parents\u0027 care, 11 per cent were living permanently with relatives and 16 per cent had been adopted, while six per cent were in the process of adoption.  A further 32 per cent continued to be looked after away from home.  Lead academic Dr Helen Whincup, from the University of Stirling, said: \u0026ldquoWhat this tells us is that when the child is going home, this happens relatively quickly. However, despite the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos explicit commitment to early permanence, other routes to secure a child\u0026rsquos care take much longer, even for our youngest children.  \u0026ldquoFor those children where adoption is the most appropriate option, there is no evidence that this decision is taken hastily in Scotland.  \"In fact, the data shows rather the opposite it takes approximately two to three years, even for those children who became looked after when they were very young.  Looking at decision-making in the Children\u0027s Hearings System, researchers found a spike in the number of children who stopped being looked after at home just on or before the 12 month limit for a new decision to be made.  Dr Whincup said this was concerning as it indicated decisions were being taken to meet a schedule or according to other priorities, rather than basing them on the needs of the child. Researchers now aim to track the children\u0026rsquos progress into adolescence and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"mike-russell-unique-ni-soft-brexit-would-be-uk-duplicity","story":"  The SNP\u0026rsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary said he intended to raise reports of a UK plan for Northern Ireland that would explicitly exclude a Scottish copy as a matter of urgency.  It followed a leak of papers from Brussels negotiators that the EU was edging towards a deal with the UK over Northern Ireland that would use technology to create a frictionless border.  The arrangement would maintain close alignment with the single market.  A newspaper report said the leak stated the solution was \u0026ldquospecically phrased for Northern Ireland so that it is not applicable for Scotland. A UK concern.  However Nicola Sturgeon has argued Scotland should be able to enjoy the same relationship as Ulster.  She tweeted in December \u0026ldquoIf one part of UK can retain regulatory alignment with EU and effectively stay in the single market, which is the right solution for Northern Ireland, there is surely no good practical reason why others can\u0026rsquot.  Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland yesterday, Mr Russell said: \u0026ldquoIf this is true then this is duplicity of a very serious degree by the UK government.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made it clear, both publicly and privately, over a long period of time, that whilst we entirely support a borderless Ireland...  there are advantages for Northern Ireland then Scotland could not stand idly by, and quite obviously so.  \"We voted, like Northern Ireland, not to Leave. Our economies are closely intertwined.  Asked whether there was a case for Northern Ireland having a unique arrangement given its history and its land border with another EU country, he said: \u0026ldquoWe would then border an EU country in those circumstances because the border would be in the Irish Sea.  \u0026ldquoBut it\u0026rsquos not an EU proposal. What the Times has reported is that the UK would be making it a condition that it [the deal] was written in such a way that Scotland could not take advantage of it.  \u0026ldquoIf they wanted to do that, they should have said to us - because there are open negotiations, the Joint Ministerial Committee is meeting - by the way, this is what we\u0026rsquore saying as part of the Northern Irish deal. They\u0026rsquove not done so.  \u0026ldquoNow that is neither fair nor welcome, and that is something we will be raising as a very serious issue.  He said he accepted there should be no border between Northern Ireland the republic, but he also said Scotland had voted heavily to Remain in the EU, and had long argued that a separate system for Scotland known as \u0026ldquodferentiation was possible.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have shown how that is possible, and we have published material on it. So  there\u0026rsquos an attempt to tie us to the UK, to drag us out against our will then we are absolutely right to object to that, particularly  it\u0026rsquos being done in secret.  Asked  the SNP would support a second vote on Brexit, Mr Russell said he would be \u0026ldquohappy to sit down with the LibDems and other proponents of a People\u0026rsquos Vote.

The Scottish peer\u0026rsquos comments - set to be ridiculed by the pro-Brexit factions and rejected by Theresa May\u0026rsquos Government - came after Sir Vince Cable told the Liberal Democrat conference that Brexit was \u0026ldquonot inevitable and urged Labour to dump Jeremy Corbyn  the Leader of the Opposition did not \u0026ldquofight Brexit and back a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  And last night, in a potentially signicant development, Michel Barnier made clear the EU was ready to come forward with an \"improved\" proposal on the Irish border \"backstop\" to reassure the British it would not lead to the creation of a frontier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  Declaring how Brussels wanted to respect the constitutional integrity of the Union, the EU27\u0026rsquos chief negotiator said: \"We are attempting to improve our proposals. What we are talking about here is not a border - not a land border, not a sea border it is a set of technical checks and controls.\"  Mr Barnier also told a news conference in Brussels the European Council on October 18/19 would be the \u0026ldquomoment of truth when it would become clear whether or not the two sides could agree a Brexit deal.  \"It is then we shall see  agreement we are hoping for is in our grasp,\" he declared.  His comments came as the Prime Minister prepares for tonight\u0026rsquos dinner at an informal EU summit in Salzburg, where she will seek to get support for her Chequers Plan from fellow European leaders.  She is expected to warn them in clear terms that rejection of her compromise proposals by MPs would lead to a damaging no-deal.  In a further sign of Mrs May\u0027s attempts to build support for the Chequers Plan, she met Manfred Weber, leader of the EPP - the main centre-right group in the European Parliament - in Downing Street on Tuesday.  A No 10 spokesman said: \"On Brexit, Weber recognised the Chequers proposals were a step forward and stressed the priority the European Parliament placed on resolving questions relating to the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland as well as to maintaining the integrity of the single market.  Speaking ahead of the Salzburg summit, Lord Callanan, the Brexit minister, said Britain had shown flexibility and now it was time for Brussels to \u0026ldquoreciprocate.  \"If we are to get a deal there has to be compromises from both sides, he insisted.  Elsewhere, UK police chiefs agreed that the policing response to Brexit should be delivered at a UK level, including dealing with any civil disruption in the wake of withdrawal, while recognising Scotland\u0027s \"distinct constitutional arrangements\".  Humza Yousaf, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Justice Secretary, said while he commended Police Scotland\u0027s offer of mutual assistance to other forces, the decision was a \u0026ldquostark reminder of the hugely damaging impact Brexit could have on our security capabilities.  The Roadmap to A People\u0026rsquos Vote, written by Lord Kerr, states: \u0026ldquoThere would be no dficulty obtaining an extension of the Article 50 timetable to allow a People\u0027s Vote to take place. If Parliament judged that it was necessary to delay the March 29 deadline so that it could consult the people in a democratic vote, the Government would not face any political or procedural obstacle to this.  It adds: \u0026ldquoIf there is a deal, the most pressing question for the country would be whether that deal is better than the one we already have inside the EU. And  there is no deal, the country deserves the right to say whether it nevertheless still wants Brexit.  The crossbench peer said: \u0026ldquoThe die is not irrevocably cast, there is still time and, until the UK has left the EU, the Article 50 letter can be withdrawn.  \u0026ldquoIf there is a majority in Parliament for a People\u0026rsquos Vote, there are multiple routes to securing one and, as the process unfolds, more opportunities for the House of Commons to assert its will may emerge.  \u0026ldquoShould the UK need more time for a People\u0026rsquos Vote, there is little doubt that the other 27 member states would agree the necessary extension of the Article 50 timetable, added Lord Kerr.  \u0026ldquoHistory will not be kind to any politician who hides behind purely logistical arguments, legalese or arcane parliamentary procedure to deny people a vote on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations at such a fragile and crucial moment for our country, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-brexit-dominated-lib-dem-conference-as-vince-cable-waved-goodbye","story":"  The party leader used his farewell keynote speech to insist leaving the EU was \u0026ldquonot inevitable and that it could be reversed  the momentum for a People\u0026rsquos Vote continued to gather pace.  As is always the case with a leader\u0026rsquos speech the most colourful language was reserved for an attack on the party\u0026rsquos main opponents, the Tories and Labour the SNP did not merit a mention. They, claimed the Lib Dem chief, had turned from \u0026ldquobroad churches into intolerant cults.  Which, of course, has left the fourth force in Westminster politics with a golden opportunity.  Yet despite the fact that loyal lieutenants were stressing how the party had doubled its appeal, from 7.4 per cent at the last election to 11 per cent-plus now - actually, a recent poll put the Lib Dems on just six per cent - the yellow peril is not picking up support anywhere near where it should be.  Sir Nick Clegg branded Jeremy Corbyn and Labour \u0026ldquopants, while he dismissed Theresa May and the Tories as \u0026ldquorubbish. Yet,  this is true, then the Lib Dem surge should be happening. But it isn\u0026rsquot.  This is undoubtedly why Vince wants change but saying you want to create a \u0026ldquomovement of the moderates hardly gets the political pulse racing. Many Lib Dems insisted they were not moderates but radicals. And then there is the plan to open up a future leadership contest to non-MPs.  A ripple of expectation rose among the yellow T-shirts when the campaigning businesswoman Gina Miller gave a conference speech but swtly burst the bubble of expectation about her own ambitions when she told delegates that she was not their leader-in-waiting.  In his keynote address, Sir Vince urged Labour and Tory rebels to have the courage to leave and, by implication, join the Lib Dems. No names were mentioned but that of Labour\u0026rsquos Chukka Umunna has been on the lips of some delegates in a positive and a negative way.  And he sought to pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn over the People\u0026rsquos Vote issue by telling the Labour comrades that  their leader does not back the second poll, then they should dump him.  But  the Lib Dems are to capitalise on the anti-Brexit sentiment, then they need an energetic, charismatic leader, who doesn\u0026rsquot fluff his lines, to lead the charge to keep Britain in the EU as soon as possible.

September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low.

They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an inidual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be erted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwe whom you interviewed.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 11:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientic and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classication of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn. A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo  only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in Scotland.Copies of both the workbooks and storybooks are available at John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Caithness Horizons.\u0026nbspWednesday 19 Sep 2018 11:38

Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks. He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartWednesday 19 Sep 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it.

While this may not achieve the same speeds as some other options, it may at least offer the benefit of a solution in the nearer future.“I welcome the fact that BT has agreed to investigate the practicalities of installing radio links and hope that this can play a part in helping deliver the improved broadband services that communities across Orkney desperately need to see.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 11:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community. We have undertaken to update stakeholders on progress and would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that the A9 at Tain remains a trunk road safety priority.\"In 2015 Transport Scotland\u0026rsquos operating company for the region, Bear, carried out a number of works on the A9 at the Tain north junction, including new signing, extended central hatching and high friction surfacing on the local road approach to the A9.Have you been involved in an accident or near miss in the area?

The demands for a rerun have seen to that, as have the two general elections and the Scottish elections that have given us earache in 2015, 2016 and 2017.                It’s no surprise then that the anniversary was marked by a report from a new group launched last year to give business leaders and entrepreneurs a voice – Scottish-Business UK. It has made the bold but carefully evidenced claim that  you think Brexit will be bad for Scotland’s economy then independence will be eight times as bad.            If you voted “No” to independence and “Remain” to EU membership then it is probably telling you what you already expect and believe. If, however, you voted any other way, Yes-Remain, Yes-Leave, or No-Leave you might wonder  the comparison with Brexit matters. After all, are these doom-laden economic claims we keep hearing nothing other than scaremongering?            : Nicola Sturgeon urged to announce Scottish independence referendum The answer is it does matter and its not scaremongering because independence and Brexit are dferent. The point of the report’s comparison about Brexit is to expose the SNP’s hypocrisy in saying how bad Brexit will be for Scotland but not accepting that independence – by the party’s own measurements – must therefore be worse, indeed, far worse.Brexit is not the same as independence for it will not change our currency – we currently use the pound and after leaving the EU it will stay that way. If, however, Scotland were to become independent we would have to either use a new currency that would take tens of billions to establish, or use the euro  or use the pound unofficially, which would be seriously damaging for those with pensions or mortgages and leave us unable to influence interest rates. Remaining in the United Kingdom means keeping the “Union Dividend” – whereby the UK treasury finances the spending gap between what Scotland contributes in taxes and what it spends on services directly from Holyrood  or indirectly from Westminster . This is no small sum, being £11.1 billion last year. Since 1980 that union idend has actually been worth £160bn in money transferred from the UK Treasury to support public services and welfare benefits in Scotland. That’s including accounting for the oil revenues in that time.: Brian Monteith: SNP are masters of the fine art of fake grievance            When we leave the EU at the end of March next year the UK will save £10bn a year and Scotland’s share of that, after allowing for the taxes it pays towards that membership – set against the farming subsidies, science grants and regional development it receives via the EU – is £500 million. So, again Brexit is dferent, with Brexit we financially gain but with independence we would have a huge shortfall we would have to find a way to pay.The one way that Brexit and independence are comparable is that  we risk Scottish exports to the EU by being outside its single market then the same risk must apply to our exports to the UK  we go outside its own single market. As Scotland sells more than four times the amount of goods and services to the UK than it does to the 27 other EU countries that has to be seen as a risk from independence.The combination of that potential risk to our trade to the UK and the loss of the union idend would hit our economy by eight times as much compared to only the potential loss of trade to the EU. Of course it may not come to that – the risks might work out less, but the idea that leaving the UK would be easier than leaving the EU just does not stand up to scrutiny for it is simply not the same.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802110.1537353368!/image/image.jpg","title":"humza yousaf begins search for alternative to railway policing plan","story":"        Justice secretary Humza Yousaf has said controversial railway policing plans have been put on hold and may never be enacted.                The minister appeared before MSPs yesterday to answers questions about the plan to integrate British Transport Police  into Police Scotland.            He said there was a “pressing need to find interim arrangements” after Police Scotland were unable to give a start date for the planned integration.            The Scotsman revealed last month that a plan to merge the two forces looked likely be scrapped amid concern it could take years to get right.Mr Yousaf yesterday said the work on the integration would be “paused” to allow interim measures to be put in place.The devolution of railway policing was one of the recommendations of the Smith Commission, published in 2014. However, parties at Holyrood have been split on the best model to take forward, with rail unions accusing the SNP of putting “Nationalist dogma” above public safety by seeking to replace BTP with Police Scotland.The merger was originally due to take place in April 2019, but the timetable was delayed.            Mr Yousaf told Holyrood’s justice committee that  all parties were “satisfied” with the interim arrangements then ministers would “have to look again at whether the legislation would be commenced or not”.He said: “It could be we get to a position where the interim arrangements satisfy us universally, the political parties around this table, the stakeholders involved.“And we believe that after a period of a couple or a few years of those arrangements being in place that we are universally satisfied that the accountability has been demonstrated, that we have the best model in place not just to maintain the safety but enhance the safety of the travelling public.“And  we got to that point frankly we would have to look at whether the legislation would be commenced or not.”            He said he was “disappointed” the merger had to be put on hold, saying: “I see the benefits of full integration, seamless policing, that single command structure, I see those benefits.”Nigel Goodband, chair of the BTP Federation, said: “We welcome the view that full integration may not be necessary.“Clearly accountability is a concern and we understand that. There are several ways to achieve this and we look forward to meeting the cabinet secretary to discuss the impact on our members.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801931.1537302869!/image/image.jpg","title":"john swinney told to listen and scrap p1 tests","story":"        Education secretary John Swinney has been urged to \u0026#8220listen and learn\u0026#8221 by scrapping controversial primary one testing ahead of a crucial vote on the issue.                With the Scottish Government facing potential defeat in the Scottish Parliament today, opposition politicians have called on Mr Swinney to admit he was wrong to introduce the tests.            The Conservatives have submitted a motion calling for the tests for four and five-year-olds to be halted.            The call came after MSPs attended a demonstration of the tests organised by the Scottish Government as ministers defended the controversial assessments. Politicians were given sample questions of the tests, which would see primary one pupils answer 30 literacy- based questions in 22 minutes and 30 numeracy questions in 27 minutes. Officials involved with creating the tests said it would be up to teachers when pupils sat the tests and whether they would sit them all at the same time. Although they admitted that “in theory” the information could be used to draw up league tables, they emphasised the system was designed to be focused on inidual pupils with the aim of providing better information for teachers.Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens oppose the tests. The Conservatives, who have no objection to assessments for older pupils, have come up with a motion that calls for them to be halted in primary one. A defeat for the Scottish Government at parliament today would mark the second time that one of Mr Swinney’s key education reforms has struggled to secure parliamentary support.Mr Swinney has already shelved his Education Bill, which had at it’s heart his flagship plans to hand control over schools to headteachers. Mr Swinney has said he would reflect on the outcome of today’s debate, but he also did not rule out defying the will of the Parliament by pointing out the vote was not binding because it was not a legislative one. Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith called on Mr Swinney to listen to objections to primary one tests from teachers and pupils. She said: “The Scottish Conservatives have been making our concerns heard about the primary one testing regime from the last two years. It is there on the record. We have listened and learned. Today’s debate is a chance for the SNP to do the same.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801984.1537342580!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland s weather possible 90mph gusts as storm ali arrives on the west coast","story":"                The Met Office amber \"be prepared\" warning for wind remains in place for a large part of Scotland until 6pm today, and the warning has been extended further north up the Aberdeenshire coast.

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801889.1537303141!/image/image.jpg","title":"westminster report scotland specific immigration system not justified","story":"        Demands from the SNP for Scotland to be given control of migration powers are not justied, a major report on European immigration to the UK has found.                A UK-government commissioned report has ruled Scotland’s economic situation did not justy having a migration policy dferent to the rest of the UK.            The Migration Advisory Committee’s  study of immigration under EU free movement rules said Scotland’s economy did not need a “very dferent” migration regime to meet its labour requirements. The report said any changes by devolved administrations would be a “political decision”, not economic.            • : 64 per cent of Scots want immigration powers devolved to HolyroodScottish ministers say Scotland’s historic trend of population decline, particularly in rural areas, means some control over migration should be passed to Holyrood – a demand the UK government has resisted.The SNP said the document was “deeply disappointing”.The MAC report was also drawn into a separate row over its recommendation that citizens from European Economic Area  countries should lose the preferential treatment they enjoy under free movement rules, despite acknowledging that post-Brexit trade talks with the EU would likely involve discussion of special immigration status. • : Vince Cable tells Labour to ditch Jeremy Corbyn and moderate MPs to quit            Business leaders also expressed disappointment the landmark report, which will have a major influence on the UK government’s migration policy after Brexit, recommended a series of new barriers for EEA migrants, warning it could lead to labour shortages and harm the economy.The MAC study, considered the most comprehensive, evidence-based look at UK migration policy in recent years, found EU free movement hasn’t had a major impact on employment levels or wages in the UK. It concluded that EEA migration had “neither the large negative effects claimed by some, nor the benefits claimed by others”.The report also said  “immigration is not to be part of the negotiations with the EU and the UK is deciding its migration system in isolation, we recommend moving to a system in which all immigration is managed with no preferential access to EU citizens”.Other recommendations include scrapping the cap on Tier 2 skilled work visas and having no specic migration route for low-skilled work, with the possible exception of a seasonal agricultural workers’ scheme.            • : Preferential immigration rules for EU citizens should end, report saysScottish migration minister Ben Macpherson said: “With all of our population increase to come from migration over the next 25 years, migration is absolutely critical to Scotland’s future prosperity.“However, the MAC report does little to consider Scotland’s needs and instead suggests that increasing the pension age would be a preferential approach to managing demographic change – a completely unsustainable position and one which we and many across Scotland would reject.“This report will also be deeply disappointing to businesses and employers across Scotland who asked for a simple, low-cost approach to migration, which took into account the requirements of their sectors.”He said the report’s proposals “completely ignore” sectors such as tourism, agriculture and forestry and “fails to address their major concerns about current and future access to workforce”.            Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said: “The SNP’s call for immigration to be devolved is therefore entirely unnecessary and could actually be detrimental.”He called on the SNP to abandon calls for a separate immigration policy, saying it could require a “border at Berwick”.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the immigration debate should be “fought UK-wide” and warned against “cutting ourselves off and looking at this issue in isolation”.Nick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits, reacted angrily to comments in the MAC report stating the UK berry industry was “small, low wage and low productivity in the wider UK context” and should not use a new seasonal workers’ scheme “to avoid the need for higher productivity” through greater use of technology. “Without access to seasonal workers ... our successful berry industry will cease to exist,” Mr Marston said.The British Chambers of Commerce said the MAC’s recommendations “are unlikely to meet the needs of all employers” and warned “any sudden cut-off of EEA skills and labour would be concerning,  not disastrous, for firms across a wide range of regions and sectors”. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development warned many UK employers would face “signicant challenges” in accessing skills and labour.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.\nFrom photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the 12th July, is a big male known as 014 or “Bigga”.  Next day, the same inidual was identied at 0800hrs heading north through Yell Sound.\nSome of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.\nCommon heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.\nChanging colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.\nFrom the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nWednesday 19 Sep 2018 11:41 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words.

So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold.

But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.\nHer government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.\nShe had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.\nBut despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.\nInstead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.\nFaced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.\nIt also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls?\nAnd while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.\nThe aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.\nHer government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.\nThis reliance on the DUP remains the central problem and  any process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.\nThe Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.\nThe Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere else on this is-land.\nLeo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.\nThere can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.\nThese are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.\nWhat is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark Moloney\n\nMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.\nFIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Ireland.\nPartitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.\nIt hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. \nThesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political

fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens

the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the

constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished

We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and ied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the

It is produced when fuels such as gas, oil, coal and wood don’t fully burn. Household appliances that are powered by such fuels include boilers, gas fires, central heating systems, water heaters, cookers and open fires.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nBreathing in carbon monoxide can make you unwell and,  you are exposed to high levels, can kill. Symptoms of carbon monoxide aren’t always obvious, particularly at low-level exposure. The most common symptoms include a tension-type headache dizziness nausea and vomiting tiredness and confusion stomach pain and shortness of breath and dficulty breathing.\n\nEnsure your home or student accommodation has a working carbon monoxide alarm in rooms where a fuel burning appliance is located and test the alarm regularly. If you have a gas appliance, make sure to ask your landlord for a gas safety certicate to show that it has been serviced annually.\n\nSmoke alarms should be installed on every level in student homes and should be tested weekly. Be aware of the dangers of phone chargers. Counterfeit phone chargers can be deadly as they are often made with poor quality components that fail to meet UK safety regulations. Always use the charger supplied with the phone. Never leave your phone to charge overnight as it can potentially cause a fire due to overheating.\n\nAlways remember to lock doors and close windows when leaving the house, even  it is only for a few minutes.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor information or advice contact Environmental Health on 0300 0300

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help? They are being left on the scrapheap and that’s just heartbreaking.”\n\nJackie is urging women who need help and advice about vaginal mesh implants to contact her via her Facebook page ‘TVT POP Mesh Problems N Ireland’ or by email: meshgirlni@icloud\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8632687.1537268642!/image/image.jpg","title":"ufu welcomes speed limit at local schools","story":"\nThe Department for Infrastructure has introduced a new part-time speed limit of 20 mph outside seven rural primary schools including Bronte Primary School, Ballynaskeagh Road, Banbridge.\n\n                \nIntroduced last Tuesday, the new legislation will reduce the National Speed Limit to 20 mph for a short time at the start and end of the school day when pupils are arriving in the morning and leaving school in the afternoon.

We would urge all motorists to take these seriously – doing so could save a child’s le.”\n\nMrs Rollston added that the UFU would like to see this extended to all rural primary schools as quickly as possible. New signage and lighting will be erected in the vicinity of the seven schools to warn motorists when the 20mph speed limit is operational.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"primark donates 50000 to","story":"\n\nPRIMARK\n say they will donate £500,000 to Belfast City Council’s recovery programme, almost a month after the devastating fire at their city centre store.\n\nThe blaze at Bank Buildings has closed 14 nearby businesses that lie within a cordon around the iconic building which is set to be in place for at least four months.\n\nIn a statement, Primark said they are donating the money as a “gesture of goodwill”.\n\nA Primark spokesperson said: \u0026#8220Following the devastating fire at Bank Buildings, Primark has been focused on the welfare of our colleagues, while also working with the authorities regarding our on-going commitment to businesses and the wider community in Belfast. \n\n\u0026#8220It is our intention to be back up and trading again as soon possible.

Despite the Troubles shutting down parts of the city, he is determined to play his headline slot in the Harp Bar even  it means playing to an audience of one. It’s here that Terri meets his we Ruth, played by West End star Niamh Perry, and the two try to build their le together, as Terri becomes distracted – all too easily – by trying to passionately promote the latest band to come on the punk scene as he turns promoter for Rudi and The Outcasts.\nIf anyone during Sunday’s afternoon matinee was expecting a leisurely retrospective they were in for a rude awakening as this is a gloriously full-on production of music and song with all-star cast in full, fine voice, all playing instruments and giving it the heap.\nEvery audience member is with our protagonist as he goes across the water, copious copies of seven-inch vinyl under his arm as he tries, most of the time in vain, to try and get snooty English music executives to listen to a band from Derry called The Undertones and their debut song Teenage Kicks – a song so iconic that John Peel did the unthinkable and played it twice on Radio One.\nWith every high comes the inevitable low and we witness how Terri releases the band from the Good Vibrations label for “£500 and a signed copy of a Shangri-Las record”.\nWith a marriage falling apart, mounting debts at the record shop and next to no revenue, a fundraising concert at the Ulster Hall sets the scene for the rousing finale and our lead’s poignant rendition of Sonny Bono’s Laugh At Me.\nA standing ovation gave way to the ‘national anthem’ as the raw opening bars of Teenage Kicks started up and the audience sang every line back to the cast.\nGood Vibrations is a must-see – simple as that. The amount of energy fizzing off the stage is infectious and the cast of ten are exceptional. A transfer to the West End must surely follow.\n\n\nGood Vibrations runs at the Lyric Theatre until Saturday, October 6.

She appeared before the inquiry in April, but it is next week\u0027s hearing at which Mrs Foster\u0027s overall actions in the cash-for-ash scandal will be most closely scrutinised in light of the evidence of other witnesses.\n\nTrending:\n \nStorm Ali: Woman dies after caravan blown off clf - power cuts sweep Northern Ireland\n\n\n\nIt is understood that former DUP spad John Robinson, who is now the party\u0027s director of communications, will appear on Wednesday.\n\nMr Robinson\u0027s brother-in-law and current DUP chief executive, Timothy Johnston, will give evidence on Friday. Mr Johnston is a former special adviser to three DUP first ministers. The inquiry has heard claims that he was involved in RHI cost control delays, which he denies.\n\nControversial former DUP spad Stephen Brimstone is expected to give evidence on Wednesday and Thursday. He was a beneficiary of the RHI scheme. A civil servant told the inquiry in June that Mr Brimstone telephoned him to inquire about the possibility of getting a boiler registered.\n\nIt was claimed he gave his name to the official, but didn\u0027t identy himself as a DUP spad.\n\nStuart Wightman, the head of the energy efficiency branch in the Department of Trade, Enterprise and Investment  said: \"The reason I remember the call is that the call was quite unusual in that it started off \u0027I believe you\u0027re the man to talk to about RHI\u0027 and I think he referenced Andrew Crawford.\n\n\"At that stage, I just thought it was a general applicant, so I would just have treated the telephone call like any other applicant wanting to find out how to apply for either scheme and I talked him through the process and referred him to the website and so forth.\"\n\nMr Wightman continued: \"So there was nothing unusual, apart from the start of the telephone conversation. But the name Brimstone - afterwards, I sort of recognised \u0027I know that name\u0027 and it was subsequent to that I realised who he was, a special adviser.\"\n\nAs an adviser to former Social Development Minister Nelson McCausland, Mr Brimstone became entangled in the Red Sky housing maintenance scandal. His treatment of then DUP councillor Jenny Palmer led to her whistleblowing on a BBC Spotlight programme.\n\nHe was accused of telling Mrs Palmer, the DUP\u0027s representative on the Housing Executive board, to change her vote in relation to a contract involving the firm Red Sky, which later went bankrupt. Mr Brimstone said he didn\u0027t accept the accuracy of her account.\n\nIn January 2017, TUV leader Jim Allister claimed in the Assembly that Mr Brimstone was \"heating his own house on the non-domestic  boiler scheme\". Speaking under parliamentary privilege, Mr Allister alleged that Mr Brimstone had a new biomass boiler in his house - but took it out and installed a new non-domestic one to \"rip off\" the RHI.\n\nIn November 2016, when Mr Brimstone left his £92,000-a-year post to pursue a career in the private sector, the Executive Office issued a statement wishing him every success and describing him as a \"valued member of staff\".\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast holyland locals take council to task over freshers week student mayhem","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I have therefore sought an urgent meeting with the chief executive of Belfast City Council to discuss the issue and what can be done to resolve the matter.\n\n\"Belfast City Council can intervene in relation to on-street drinking and I will be urging the organisation to do just that. With the correct intervention now, we can turn the tide in the Holyland and help locals restore the area to the long-term residential area it once was.\"\n\nGreen Party MLA Clare Bailey asked students and their parents to \"consider the realities of le in the Holyland\". \n\n\"The university and local residents have appealed directly to the young people involved in anti-social behaviour,\" she said.\n\n\"These appeals have often fallen on deaf ears, with a recent noisy party driving one resident out of his home and into his car in an attempt to sleep.\n\n\"Parents are quite rightly proud to see their young people heading off to university to start a new chapter in their lives. \n\n\"Issues often stem from poor choices from young people, with noisy parties and on-street drinking piling misery on residents.\n\n\"However, students and their families may not always be aware of the other dangers that exist across the Holyland. \n\n\"The area has a high crime rate and is an extremely over-crowded location, with low quality housing predominating. Indeed, there were a number of serious sexual assaults in the Holyland area during this time last year.\n\n\"Thefts and burglaries are also a problem, with high value items such as laptops and mobile phones rich pickings for criminals.\n\n\"I\u0027d therefore urge the families and parents of students to sit down and have a conversation about the realities of le in the Holyland.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup man apologises over twitter slur about ballymurphy massacre rally speaker","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

And when that is coupled with living in an environment which amplies that dference, then the pressure can be unbearable.\n\n\"As a council we are unable to change the feelings iniduals might have, but we can certainly create an environment of acceptance and love that will give our LGBT brothers and sisters time and space to fulfil their lelong potential.\"\n\nThe motion was presented by Alliance councillor Andrew Muir.\n\nHe said: \"I presented this motion in the hope that we could make a positive dference to the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people living, working or visiting our borough and I\u0027m delighted to have secured backing of the relevant council committee in affirming that LGBT people should be accepted and valued just like everyone else.\"\n\nIn June, DUP leader Arlene Foster made headlines by attending a PinkNews event at Stormont, where she told the LGBT community that she looks at them \"as my neighbours or my fellow citizens\".\n\nMr Muir hopes \"common sense\" will prevail next week.\n\n\"At the Pink News event on June 28 this year DUP leader Arlene Foster stated she wanted to acknowledge the contribution of the LGBT community in Northern Ireland and to recognise the reality of ersity among our citizens.\n\n\"She further recognised that some of our brightest and best in this country are part of the LGBT community. This motion is only a reflection of those words.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup rejects barnier bid to solve ireland border obstacle to brexit progress","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The fact is that both Theresa May and the Labour Party have said no British Prime Minister could accept such a concept. It is not just unionists who object.\n\n\"And anyone with the desire to see our economy prosper will not want to see barriers put in the way of sales to and from our biggest market in the rest of the UK.\n\n\"There is however one upside in all of this. Having dismissed technology as magical thinking for the border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland it is suddenly okay for the border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Progress of sorts!”\n\nThe issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic has emerged as the main obstacle to an agreement ahead of the UK’s withdrawal in March 2019.\n\nThe EU is insisting on a “backstop” proposal which would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union in the event of the two sides failing to reach an agreement in order to avoid the  of a “hard border”.\n\nHowever Mrs May has rejected the plan as unacceptable arguing that it would effectively create a border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nMr Barnier said he was working on a plan to “de-dramatise” the controls that would be necessary in the event of the backstop coming into play.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe border between Londonderry and Donegal at Bridgend \n\n\n\n\n“We are ready to improve this proposal. Work on the EU side is ongoing.\n\n“We are clarying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed,” he said.\n\n“We can also clary that most checks can take place away from the border at the company premises or in the markets. We need to de-dramatise the checks that are needed.”\n\nHe reminded the British, however, that the checks were the result of their decision to leave not only the EU but also the single market and the customs union.\n\n“What we need in the withdrawal agreement is a legally operational backstop which fulls respects the territorial integrity of the UK.\n\n“It is a backstop that will only apply unless a better solution is found,” he said.\n\nHis comments came as EU leaders prepare to gather in Salzburg on Wednesday for an informal summit – the first time they have met together since Mrs May published her Chequers blueprint for Brexit in July.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"storm ali 32000 and counting without power as northern","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It’s only really overnight the winds start to ease off and even then it stays pretty windy across Scotland so, a very windy spell throughout Wednesday into Wednesday night as well.\n\n“It’s going to be windy everywhere and there will be a band of rain that pushes its way across the UK as well.”\n\n\n\n#StormAli\n is heading for Northern Ireland and Scotland - be aware of the weather warnings... \npic.twitter/wwC1bm42eN\n\n— Met Office  \nSeptember 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAli is first on the storm names list for 2018-19 announced by the Met Office and Met Eireann, which has run the Name Our Storms scheme for four years.\n\nThe season’s names have been compiled from a list of submissions by the public, choosing some of the most popular names and also selecting those which reflect the nations, culture and ersity of the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe practice is aimed at raising awareness of severe weather before it hits, with polling finding almost 80% of people think naming storms is useful in making them realise severe weather may have a greater impact than normal.\n\nThe unsettled weather is due to last right through the week, Mr Wilson added, but an improvement is expected early next week as drier weather is set to take hold.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"use em quick say those who vouch for vouchers","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

If I get a voucher it is gone in no time and I know my whole family would be the same. They only burn a hole in your pocket otherwise,\" she said.\n\nFull-time mum Alyss Turner  also has no fear, as she is not a hoarder. \"It\u0027s gone almost immediately, but I don\u0027t tend to buy vouchers for other people as I plan months in advance, I\u0027m never caught out by the pressure,\" she said.\n\nAshleigh Dawson , who regularly buys gt cards for her nephews and nieces, said the House of Fraser fiasco has caused her to hesitate. \n\n\"I send them as birthday and Christmas presents but this has definitely made me think twice,\" she said. \n\n\"I also have a gt card at the moment with £30 on it for another store  it was a larger amount I would certainly be in a rush to get rid of it.\" \n\nJohn McCavana  purchased a gt card from a baby store following the birth of his great-granddaughter six weeks ago, but said he was unaware of the risks involved. \n\n\"Why would you sell them  this can happen?\" he asked. \"I don\u0027t buy them regularly, it was crisp £50s in my day, which seems to be the best way.\" \n\nSarah Burrell  was out shopping yesterday but left her gt cards at home.

Mr Cuddy added: \"The big problem is the amount of money being spent on this.\n\n\"This is the road to nowhere.\n\n\"The fact that the signs are being changed again so soon just shows how poorly thought-out they were, and my understanding is that this is wasting ratepayers\u0027 money.\n\n\"The position of the UUP group on Mid Ulster Council is that we aren\u0027t against the Irish language.\n\n\"The problem is the amount of money and resources being allocated to all its forms. Look at the money being thrown at this when there are so many things which are more real to people.\n\n\"We are a large area and there are pressures on our budget and capital projects for the wider community.\n\n\"So many projects are crying out for money, and we are focusing on signs.\"\n\nCookstown Ulster Unionist councillor Trevor Wilson added: \"It is very disappointing that we are changing the signs already at an exorbitant cost to the ratepayer.\"\n\nNo response had been received from Mid Ulster District Council at the time of going to press.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"weather alert northern ireland battens down the hatches as storm ali arrives","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Some 17,000 homes were built across Britain in 1920/21, jumping quickly to 110,000 in 1921/22. Housing was a big concern for Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George, who had campaigned on the slogan of building homes “fit for heroes”.\n\n– The scale of building fluctuated over the next two decades, peaking in 1938/39, when 122,000 new council houses were completed, but the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 brought building almost to a halt.\n\n– It was not until 1946 that major construction began again, hitting 168,780 in 1949. Between then and 1978, the total number of new council homes completed each year in the UK never fell below 100,000.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– Construction was particularly high during the 1950s. In 1953 almost a quarter of a million new council homes  were completed – the highest number for any one year since records began. This was a period when successive Conservative prime ministers Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan made housebuilding a priority of their governments.\n\n– Council house building fell dramatically from 1979 onwards. This was a consequence of changes introduced by Conservative governments led by Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Councils were redesignated as “enablers” working with housing associations to deliver accommodation, rather than “providers”. Council tenants were given the chance to purchase their own homes under the Right to Buy scheme, which reduced the stock of council housing. Councils were allowed to keep only a portion of the income from these sales.\n\n– The number of newly built council houses fell from 88,530 in 1980 to 17,710 in 1990. The decline accelerated in the next two decades, hitting a low of just 130 in 2004. By comparison, in 2004 20,660 new homes were completed by housing associations, while 182,700 were completed by private firms.\n\n– In recent years housebuilding by local authorities has picked up again. In 2017 a provisional total of 3,280 were built by councils across the UK. But this was still only 1.7% of the total new homes completed in the UK in 2017, with 16.6% built by housing associations and 81.7% privately.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"zara and mike tindall take to the saddle to launch charity bike ride","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Trump  \nSeptember 19, 2018\n\n\n\n\nBut Mr Trump’s late-night tweets did not address the US matching North Korea’s moves.\n\n“Kim Jong Un has agreed to allow Nuclear inspections, subject to final negotiations, and to permanently dismantle a test site and launch pad in the presence of international experts. In the meantime there will be no Rocket or Nuclear testing,” Mr Trump said in a pair of tweets.\n\n“Hero remains to continue being ed home to the United States. Also, North and South Korea will file a joint bid to host the 2032 Olympics. Very exciting!”\n\nNorth Korea has been demanding a declaration formally ending the Korean War, which was stopped in 1953 by a ceasefire, but neither leader mentioned it as they read the joint statement.\n\n“We have agreed to make the Korean Peninsula a land of peace that is free from nuclear weapons and nuclear threat,” Mr Kim said as he stood by Mr Moon’s side at the guesthouse where Mr Moon is staying.\n\n“The road to our future will not always be smooth and we may face challenges and trials we can’t anticipate. But we aren’t afraid of headwinds because our strength will grow as we overcome each trial based on the strength of our nation.”\n\nMr Kim and Mr Moon earlier smiled and chatting as they walked down a hallway and into a meeting room to finalise the joint statement, which also said that the leaders would push for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons and to “eliminate all the danger of war”.\n\nNorth Korea was expected to hold a huge mass games spectacle later in the day, with Mr Moon attending an event expected to draw about 150,000 spectators, Seoul said. It was not clear  Mr Kim would attend.\n\nNorth Korea first staged its mass games in 2002, when Mr Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, was leader. They continued most every year until 2014, then were revived during North Korea’s celebrations of the 70th anniversary of its state founding earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nMoon Jae-in shakes hands with Kim Jong Un after a joint press conference in Pyongyang, \n\n\n\n\nMr Kim gave the South Korean president an exceedingly warm welcome on Tuesday, the first day of the summit, meeting him and his we at Pyongyang’s airport — itself a very unusual gesture — then riding into town with Mr Moon in an open limousine through streets lined with crowds of North Koreans, who cheered and waved the flag of their country and a blue-and-white flag that symbolises Korean unity.\n\nThe made-for-television welcome has become routine for their summits, after two meetings earlier this year.\n\nThe summit talks began at the ruling Workers’ Party headquarters where Mr Kim and Mr Moon were joined by two of their top deputies — spy chief Suh Hoon and presidential security director Chung Eui-yong for Mr Moon, and for Mr Kim, his sister, Kim Yo Jong, and senior Workers’ Party official Kim Yong Chol, according to Mr Moon’s office.\n\nAt the start of their meeting on Tuesday, Mr Kim thanked Mr Moon for brokering the June summit with Mr Trump.\n\n“It’s not too much to say that it’s Moon’s efforts that arranged a historic North Korea-US summit. Because of that, the regional political situation has been stabilised and more progress on North Korea-US ties is expected,” Mr Kim said, according to South Korean media pool reports and Mr Moon’s office.\n\nMr Moon responded by expressing his own thanks to Mr Kim for making a “bold decision” in a New Year’s speech to open a new era of detente and send a delegation to the South Korean Winter Olympics in February.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"council urge students heed safety advice new academic year gets underway","story":"\nDerry City and Strabane District Council say being mindful of potential hazards in the home and putting in place some simple home safety measures can make the dference between le and death. \n\n\n\nCarbon Monoxide\nCarbon Monoxide is a poisonous gas that has no smell or taste.

halts redevelopment derelict site bogside area derry","story":"\nPlans to redevelop an empty site in the Bogside area of Derry have been halted after an ‘unknown purchaser’ bought the lands, it has emerged.\n\nThe derelict lands at Meenan Square have for the last number of years been the source of anti-social behaviour in the area, having also been the site of a number of controversial bonfires.\n\nIn the wake of the most recent bonfire on August 15, which followed six nights of continuous rioting in the area, local councillors proposed that a number of solutions to address the problem, including the demolition of buildings, now be looked at.\n\nThe Urban Villages initiative had been planning to develop the site ‘for a range of purposes’ which would include a ‘community aspect’.\n\nOverseen by the Executive Office , the Urban Villages  initiative is designed to improve good relations outcomes and develop thriving places where there has been a history of deprivation and community tension.\n\nA representative from Urban Villages told the September meeting of the council’s Environment and Regeneration Committee that Apex Housing Ltd was lined up as their partner to deliver the project.\n\nHowever, the meeting was told that the site had been bought by an ‘unknown purchaser’.\n\nUrban Villages have asked the selling agent for contact with the inidual to ‘establish the new owner’s intentions for the site’ and in the meantime they have been ‘developing a business case’.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize

has indicated that they are willing to have a ‘conversation’ with Urban Villages and they hope the owner will work with them with a view to developing the area.\n\n\n‘Death trap’\n\n\nSinn Féin Councillor Kevin Campbell said people know the history of the site and the fact it had ‘one of the main bonfires in the city’.\n\n “The owner needs to be contacted to have the site secured immediately – it’s an absolute death trap at the moment,” he said.\n\nSDLP Councillor Brian Tierney said it was a timely presentation given that residents living in the area ‘had to put up with some of the worst anti-social behaviour’ in a long time over the summer. \n\nHe said there has been ‘rumour after rumour’ during the summer about the identity of a possible buyer.\n\nDirector of Environment and Regeneration, Karen Philips, said that efforts would be made to contact the new owner about securing the site and  that was not done ‘notices’ would be served on him as it

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

It also provided an opportunity to maximise the natural resources of Portaferry by creating a space to access the outdoor recreational infrastructure with a particular focus on maritime activity.\n\nThe project began in 2017 when, after a seven-year search for ideas and funding, the sailing club was successful in getting permission to develop a semi-derelict building adjoining its premises.\n\nTo develop and manage the property, the club formed Portaferry Community Services Ltd.\u0026nbsp Renovation work on the Hub was finally completed in April this year.\u0026nbsp\n\nFunding came from a number of sources including Portaferry Regeneration Ltd through their Heritage Lottery\u0026rsquos Townscape Heritage Initiative, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, the Rural Development Programme, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, Leader, Rural Partners Ards and North Down, Ards and North Down Borough Council, The Coastal Communities Fund and Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nPrincess Anne was welcomed on Wednesday morning by Mr Leonard Lawson, Director of Portaferry Community Services Ltd, who managed the Hub project, and Mr John McAlea, commodore of Portaferry Sailing Club.\n\nThanking Princess Anne, Mr Leonard paid tribute to all of the people who brought the project to a successful fruition, including the architect, contractor, consultants, ious funders and user groups, as well as the sailing club and its voluntary workforce.\n\nHe said the club had the \u0026ldquovision and courage to invest in this project and risk going ahead with such a large scheme and had trusted him to manage the project.\n\n\u0026ldquoPeople don\u0026rsquot realise that when groups within communities create these schemes they are depending on vast amounts of voluntary input in terms of time and commitment, Mr Lawson remarked.\n\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank each and everyone one of you for the support and co-operation that has made this project possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt is incredible that It takes all this number of people, the thousands of emails, countless meetings, official forms, letters and telephone calls to bring this about.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

and many were part of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.\n\n                \nOur congregations have buried too many of their members, have pastored loved ones and the injured, and have supported those who lost homes, farms and businesses. As a people we therefore have some understanding of the pain and trauma that was inflicted on the community over the years by unjustied acts of terrorism.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWe are also very aware of the deficiencies in the status quo in relation to the past – some of which have been articulated here in the Newsletter in recent weeks. There is broad agreement that the current arrangements are not delivering. The status quo is not acceptable.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nOver the summer we have invited responses from within the church and talked to ious groups and iniduals about the Secretary of State’s consultation – all in the hope that we can help to shape a way forward for the benefit of victims and survivors, and for wider society.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nBuilding on the work of Eames-Bradley and the Haass-O’Sullivan talks, the Stormont House Agreement proposed a broad framework with four main elements: investigations, information recovery, historical analysis/storytelling, and a reconciliation aspect. We believe that this broad framework represents an opportunity to find an agreed and acceptable process which could command cross-community support.\n\nHowever, the outworking of this, as set out in the Secretary of State’s proposals, is not currently acceptable. It needs considerable amendment. But with that amendment, however, we believe there is scope within these proposals to address the legacy of the past in a way that is signicantly better than what we have at the moment.\n\nRealistically there are only two options on the table - the status quo and a signicantly amended version of what the Secretary of State has proposed. A blanket rejection now of the proposals will likely set this issue back for many years, or maybe forever. This will add even more distress to that already endured, as more victims and survivors pass away without the help, support and information they need. Time is running out.\n\nOf course, we must recognise the limitations of each of the four elements. In particular the number of prosecutions resulting from the work of the Historical Investigations Unit  is likely to be very small and many families will not receive all the information they seek.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this context it would be deeply wrong to raise the expectations of victims and survivors, as this will only add to the hurt and pain already experienced. Yet we also acknowledge that for some families there is a possibility of a degree of comfort or closure from the institutions proposed,  they can be made more acceptable.\n\nRather than start again in the future from a blank page it is much better to seek to improve what is in the Government’s consultation document. For example, we believe that any of the families who have received a Historical Enquiries Team report should have the option of requesting an HIU investigation.\n\nThere must also be greater assurance and clarication around the role and responsibilities of the Irish Government. This is essential to ensure that relatives of those killed outside of Northern Ireland, or in cross-border incidents, have full access to a proper investigation.\n\nIt seems increasingly unrealistic that the HIU and the Independent Commission on Information Retrieval can work effectively in parallel – the operating model needs to be reconsidered. The Oral History Archive simply will not work well unless it is designed to reach out and work with other groups and organisations that command the trust of those who might contribute. And a great deal of work needs to be done to clary and develop the role of the Implementation and Reconciliation Group in promoting reconciliation throughout our society.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThese are just some of the points that we will be taking up in more detail when we submit our response to the consultation in the coming days. We will also take the opportunity to raise some very important issues, which seem to have been deliberately left out of the consultation. A Mental Trauma Service and a pension for the severely injured must be included in any comprehensive package that seeks to address the legacy of the past.\n\nFurthermore, a serious effort must also be made to deal with the sense of moral outrage and hurt caused by the current definition of a victim, which draws no distinction between the perpetrators and those attacked. Progress will be very much more dficult  this distinction is not faced in some coherent way.\n\nMuch has been said about other inadequacies in the consultation document – especially about investigations into alleged offences of members of the security forces. We share those concerns. However, in our response we will focus on other issues that have not received adequate public attention. It may be a cliché, but the devil is in the detail, both of what is already in the consultation document, and what is not. Detailed scrutiny is very important  any worthwhile progress is to come from this consultation.\n\n\nVery Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBE is Convener of the Council for Public Affairs of the Presbyterian

number of power cuts across Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nThey say that presently around 32,000 customers are without electricity - and NIE Networks expect this number to rise over the coming hours.\n\nwindow.twttr =  [0],    t = window.twttr ||      t  js = d.createElement  js.id = id  js.src = \"https:platform.twitter/widgets.js\"  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore   t._e = []  t.ready =

around 70mph are causing damage to the electricity network with trees, branches and other flying debris bringing down power lines and poles which now need to be repaired or replaced. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThey add that the majority of faults are currently located in the Omagh, Dungannon and Enniskillen areas - and they expect winds to move north and east over the coming hours.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThey say their Incident Management Centre at Craigavon and their twelve Local Incident Centres across Northern Ireland have been open from early morning in preparation for this storm.\n\nA NIE Networks’ spokesperson said “Customers can contact us online at nienetworks or by phone on \n03457 643 643\n to report the location of damage to the electricity network. Updated information will be provided regularly and NIE Networks has asked that customers listen to their radios, visit our website or follow us on Facebook and Twitter for updates.”\n\n\n   \n
