The EU introduced checks on goods from Britain entering the bloc as soon as the Brexit deal came into effect, with experts warning that UK firms were losing their competitiveness.  This chart shows the details: This data rather chimes with the message from a group of MPs this morning, that the main impact of Brexit on UK firms had been “increased costs, paperwork and border delays”. There could be worse to come as new import controls are introduced. The cross-party Public Accounts Committee (PAC) reported that Brexit red tape has damaged Britain’s trade with the EU. The situation could worsen unless the government works with Brussels to reduce hold-ups at UK ports German factories have also been hit by the supply chain crisis, so will be hoping the EU’s new multi-billion chip production plan can help them. The €43bn scheme aims to overcome Europe’s dependency on Asian computer chip makers, as governments and businesses around the world battle shortages that experts believe could persist for much of the year.  We’ll hear from Huw Pill, the Bank of England’s chief economist, later when he speaks at the Society of Professional Economists annual conference, on the “UK Monetary Policy Outlook.”  European markets have open higher, with the FTSE 100 near a two-year high. Some commodity prices are also under pressure, with aluminium hitting its highest since 2008 on Tuesday. Addressing the Society of Professional Economists this lumchtime, Pill said:  Reuters has the story: And here are some highlights from Isabel Schnabel’s Q\u0026ampA, where she outlined the ECB’s strategy: Ofcom previously maintained that such a reduction in competition would lead to higher-priced phones and bills for consumers and businesses. Under the former chief executive Sharon White, Ofcom was an outspoken opponent of Three UK’s attempted £10.25bn takeover of O2, which was blocked by competition regulators six years ago. Ofcom said on Tuesday it had now “clarified its position on mobile consolidation”. Months before the deal was blocked, White, who is now the chair of the John Lewis Partnership, delivered a scathing speech attacking the deal, saying that a move from four to three main players would “shift the balance of power” in the market. “Competition is the lifeblood of today’s telecoms market, spurring innovation, better coverage and fair prices,” she said.  But Ofcom has now softened its stance... Here’s the full story: The world’s biggest shipping company has reported record profits, thanks to surging demand from a rebounding global economy. Denmark’s A.P. Moeller-Maersk says 2021 was its most profitable year yet. It made pre-tax profits of $18.73bn last year, up from $3.3bn in 2020. It benefitted from the jump in freight rates, as customers battled to get goods shipped around the world due to high demand and global supply chain disruption. Shareholders profited too, with $3bn of share buy-backs and idends in 2021. A.P. Moeller- Maersk also predicted that 2022 would be strong, with the shipping situation expected to return to normal early in the second half of this year. Søren Skou, CEO of A.P. Moller - Maersk, says: Stocks have opened higher on Wall Street, as investors regain their risk appetite after last month’s wobbles. Every sector is higher, led by real estate, materials and firms providing discretionary goods and services to consumers. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says confidence is building as investors come to terms with interest rates rising soon. Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, says the increase in borrowing costs is hitting demand. Those higher rates are deterring people from refinancing loans -- the MBA’s Refinance Index decreased 7 percent from the previous week and was 52 percent lower than the same week one year ago. Low supply of homes is also hurting mortgage take-up.  But he then explained that there are occasions when aggressive action is needed. Given the inevitable conceptual and empirical uncertainty, he says, it risks mis-calibrating monetary policy by picking the wrong value for r*. In a speech titled “Monetary policy with a steady hand”, Huw Pill explain that international energy and goods prices are driving UK headline inflation higher, having “repeatedly surprised to the upside” in the last year.  Those higher prices are also hitting UK real national income. Should they stabilise, then their impact on inflation will dissipate. But, Pill warns, there is considerable uncertainty: The BoE’s ‘big call’ is that the stronger momentum in domestic wage and cost growth will ease beyond this year, as headline inflation falls and unemployment rises as energy prices hit incomes and economic demand. On that basis, Pill says, the easing of domestic inflationary pressures is achieved without the UK falling into recession, cautioning: Pill explains that if inflationary pressures ease, interest rates could stay lower for longer. But if there are signs of energy price driving up wage settlements, the Bank could tighten policy faster. Pill says there may be occasions when monetary policy actions are needed: But right now, Pill concludes that “a case can be made for a measured rather than activist approach to policy decisions”.

Adam Land, senior director for remedies, business and financial analysis at the CMA, said: Polling company YouGov and economic consultancy Cebr have reported that consumer confidence dropped this month to the lowest since last March, as people worry about rising prices, tax increases and their job security. The index of households’ expectations for their financial situation in 12 months’ time tumbled by 4.5 points to 79.1, the lowest since October 2013.  The drop in consumer confidence highlights the impact of the rising cost of living on household sentiment, says Sam Miley, senior economist at Cebr:  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53f8162bb499092ed316c64ee4156705c565c1f3/1401_2131_5340_3203/master/5340.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2399dbd41170ebb4a7e6f2d902cb2a99","title":"al hilal v chelsea club world cup semi final live","story":"First-team coach Zsolt Low, deputising for Tuchel due to the German testing positive for Covid, has been full of praise for Cech in the build-up to today’s match.

File photograph: Getty ImagesA grave at Glasnevin Cemetery in north Dublin was being exhumed by gardaí on Wednesday as part of a cold-case inquiry dating back to the 1980s.The exhumation at the Dublin cemetery early on Wednesday was being conducted for the purposes of obtaining samples that may identify a man who died about 40 years ago. His body was taken from the River Liffey in Dublin but he was never identified, meaning his body could never be claimed and his remains were buried in an unmarked grave.In reply to queries, Garda Headquarters in the Phoenix Park confirmed an exhumation was taking place “as part of ongoing efforts to formally identify a deceased male that was taken from the River Liffey” in May of 1982.“The exhumation is for the purposes of obtaining a DNA sample in the hope of identifying the deceased.”Gardaí have identified dozens of graves around the country in which unidentified human remains were buried between the 1970s and 1990s. While the total number is almost 40, some 12 graves at Glasnevin have been identified by the Garda National Missing Persons Unit as containing remains that were not identified on burial.It was expected Wednesday’s exhumation would be the first in a series of operations aimed at obtaining DNA profiles of several unidentified people who were buried in similar circumstances at different times since the late 1970s. Once those samples have been taken from the bodies they can be crosschecked against a database of DNA samples taken from the relatives of people who went missing and are assumed dead.Many families of people who are missing presumed dead have continued to campaign for decades for news of their loved ones. As DNA-based police work has become more sophisticated, it now offers a line of inquiry not available at the time of many of the disappearances.More to follow.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"who is on the commission on the defence forces and what is its remit","story":"The commissioning ceremony of 68 new Army Officers, 2 Air Corps Officers and 8 Maltese Officers at the Curragh camp in 2018.

The report did not pull its punches and he hopes it would now lead to a very positive debate about the Defence Forces.Mr Coveney added that the report was “a very credible, hard-hitting honest report that the Government now needs to find a way of responding to”.Ireland’s Defence Forces could not adequately protect the country from an attack should one happen, he admitted.It would take “four to five months” for the report to be analysed fully as there is a lot of detail in relation to pay and allowances that have to be examined. The report contained strong recommendations about “the totality of remuneration package”.When asked if there was the political will to address the concerns, Mr Coveney responded: “What we spend on defence in Ireland and what we have spent does reflect poorly on the priority of defence in Ireland”.In order to ensure the Defence Forces were properly resourced, the Minister would have to make the political arguments to spend “potentially hundreds of millions of euro” when the money could be spent elsewhere.In the report, Ireland’s defence forces had been compared with eight other countries of similar population all of which spend “dramatically more than we do”.There is a strong argument that the Defence Forces are under-resourced for what they are expected to do, added Mr Coveney.Former defence forces officer Cathal Berry TD told the same programme that the report had the potential to be “transformational” if the resources were made available. A simple measure would be to allow the two military representative organisations to affiliate with ICTU on the issue of pay. Military representatives had been “locked out” of national pay talks for decades which had led to a widening gap between military pay and other pay."},{"url":null,"title":"ff fg made home ownership pipe dream for entire generation mcdonald","story":"Sinn Féin housing spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin has been reprimanded in the Dáil after he accused Taoiseach Micheál Martin of downright lies during a debate on rent prices and housing supply. Video: Oireachtas TVSinn Féin leader Mary-Lou McDonald  said affordability had gone ‘out the window’ on Micheal Martin’s watch. Photograph: SinnFeinPA WireHer party’s housing spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin has also accused the Taoiseach of lying about their party’s housing policy. During heated exchanges in the Dáil on Wednesday, Ms McDonald pointed to the latest figures from Daft.ie which show the number of homes available to rent has fallen close to historic lows while rents have increased sharply. Ms McDonald said other figures reveal cuckoo funds “courtesy of sweetheart tax deals” provided by the Government massively outbid ordinary house-buyers for family homes and then rent them back to those people “at extortionate rates”. She said affordability had gone “out the window” on Mr Martin’s watch and that the latest budget “did nothing for renters”. The Dublin Central TD said the Government’s rent caps “have been a failure” and that generation rent feels “battered, bruised, exhausted and sold out”. “Rip off rents rob a generation of the decent life and the ability to build their future,” she said. LyingIn response, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said 33,000 homes were needed to be constructed on average per year until 2030 to satisfy demand as well a consistent housing policy that lasts over a decade. He said supply was needed as quickly as possible and that private investment was required on top of the State’s investment. Mr Martin said what was not needed is “serial objections as your party has”, adding that Sinn Féin has objected to about 6,000 homes. He said this was “hypocrisy” and in contrast “to the huge crisis we have”. Mr Ó Broin shouted across the Dáil that he was “fed up with this Taoiseach lying about what Sinn Féin councillors are doing”. “They are downright lies,” he said. Ceann Comhairle Sean O Fearghail said it was not acceptable to accuse any member of the House of lying and asked the Sinn Féin TD to withdraw the comments.Mr O’Broin said that he would substitute “lying” for “wilfully misleading the House”.Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said Ireland’s young population are going to be condemned to continuing to pay “crippling rents” for the foreseeable future, with rents now 50 per cent higher than during the Celtic Tiger peak. She said it was plainly obvious the rent caps aren’t working and most people believe “this is out of control” and that the housing solutions have been designed “really favouring cuckoo funds over the inidual homebuyer”. “That’s the obvious thing that is happening here,” she said. “Do you ever question that you could be getting this wrong? “Fianna Fáil have got it wrong before. Do you ever question that you’re talking to the wrong people or you’re taking the wrong advice? Look at the evidence, look at rent, who can afford €2,000 a month…It’s only going to be a question of time before we see young people queuing up at the airport to leave this country and they’re going to be doing it because they can’t live in it.

They were also 17 and 21 per cent less likely to die of heart disease or stroke respectively. Over the study period, 3.4 per cent of moderate coffee drinkers died, compared with 3.7 per cent of abstainers and four per cent of caffeine fiends. Among the coffee drinkers, one fifth preferred decaffeinated, a quarter drank ground beans and just over half opted for instant coffee. The health benefits of coffee, however, only applied to ground and decaf coffee, and were not seen among instant coffee drinkers.“While ground coffee was associated with decreased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, we did not find a statistically significant association between regular instant coffee consumption and health outcomes,” the scientists wrote in their study. “The difference among the various coffee types may be explained by the differences in their production process, as they contain different chemicals.”The research also found that decaffeinated ground coffee has health benefits, as those who regularly opted for decaf had a lower risk of death compared with those who did not drink coffee at all.It also found that because decaffeinated coffee was found to lower the risk of death compared to those who did not drink coffee at all, the benefits from coffee only partly come from caffeine, with antioxidants and other chemicals likely to be playing a key role.Dr Zahra Raisi-Estabragh, a co-author of the study from Queen Mary University of London, said: “Most of the participants drank either ground or instant coffee. Ground coffee in moderate amounts was associated with lower mortality risk - but this benefit was not found amongst the regular instant coffee drinkers.“The reason behind this may relate to the different production process of the ground and instant forms as they contain different additives.”The discrepancy between the health benefits of ground and instant coffee should be the focus of future research, the scientists said.But while moderate consumption of ground coffee was found to be beneficial, more than three cups a day was linked to poorer health outcomes. Study co-author Dr Pal Maurovich-Horvat, the director of the Medical Imaging Centre at the Semmelweis University, said: “Using MRI scans, we were able to analyse the effect of regular coffee intake on the structure and function of the heart.We found that regular light to moderate coffee consumption is beneficial for the health of the heart, with the suggestion that it can slow down age-related cardiac changes.”The study adds to a tranche of papers that have investigated the health impact of coffee, with fierce debate erupting over whether it is good or bad. This paper adds significant weight to the argument that the drink is beneficial.Prof Steffen Petersen, of Queen Mary University, added: “Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages in the world, however its cardiovascular effects are not well-known, and some previous studies have shown contradictory results.“As far as we know, this has been the largest study to date which focused on the effect of coffee on cardiovascular health.”More from NewsCatholic priest showed sexual abuse victim a corpse to intimidate him into silenceBoris Johnson confirms Covid isolation laws will be scrapped later this month at PMQsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Liz Truss warns invasion would trigger \u0026#39severe\u0026#39 sanctions as she lands in MoscowSnow Moon 2022: when it peaks in the UK and other full moon datesJeremy Clarkson backs farmers over ‘utter madness’ of vegan-only food at council meetingsLegal requirement to self-isolate with Covid set to be scrappedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"long long last covid yesterdays news","story":"More from NewsBoris Johnson confirms Covid isolation laws will be scrapped later this month at PMQsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Liz Truss warns invasion would trigger \u0026#39severe\u0026#39 sanctions as she lands in MoscowSnow Moon 2022: when it peaks in the UK and other full moon datesJeremy Clarkson backs farmers over ‘utter madness’ of vegan-only food at council meetingsLegal requirement to self-isolate with Covid set to be scrappedEarly ‘lab-grown’ Covid virus found in sample lends weight to Wuhan theoryMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon cant apologise covid mistakes","story":"Scrolling through Facebook the other day I came across an advert paid for by the Scottish Government advising tenants that they cannot be moved out of their accommodation without written notice. At the corner of the advert – too large to be inconspicuous – was the familiar blue and white saltire featuring the legend: “Fairer Scotland”.Huge amounts of tax-payers’ money is used every day, not primarily to promote public information messages about tenants’ rights, but to hammer home the message that Scotland is fairer, healthier, friendlier, better than… well, you can guess who.It’s all part of a grand, publicly-funded strategy aimed at convincing undecided Scots that independence really would result in more “progress” towards a society that most of them would want to see. But a vital plank of the strategy is to convince voters that those in charge – Nicola Sturgeon and her lieutenants – are not just up to the job of forging a new nation but are unimpeachable embodiments of political perfection.Boris Johnson may find it difficult to say the word “sorry”, but the word seems to have been completely expunged from the Scottish dictionary. Take two recent and obvious examples.Last week MSPs at Holyrood demanded to know how money set aside by the Scottish government would be used to improve air circulation in schools and consequently reduce the incidence of Covid. Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, said: “The Covid pandemic began more than two years ago. The Scottish government has had all that time to make our schools fit for use. Why then, First Minister, are we in the position, after all this time, that one of your Government’s ideas to protect kids and teachers is to chop the bottom off of classroom doors?”In dismissive tones, the First Minister replied: “If doors or windows are not enabling that natural flow of air in the way that is wanted, it strikes me as basic common sense to take measures to rectify that.”This caused much amusement in the political sphere, and much consternation among those who could see the risks from having fire doors that didn’t stretch all the way to the floor. The Fire Brigades Union demanded an emergency meeting with ministers to discuss the plan, and parents were understandably worried.Yet no minister has actually admitted that the plan was a stupid one. Indeed, one of them, Shirley-Anne Somerville, has doubled down and insisted that “undercutting” would be needed if new extractor fans changed the air pressure in classrooms – an argument that was entirely missing from the First Minister’s argument just days earlier.This follows another public spat involving the question as to which government – Scottish or UK – would be responsible for paying pensions in an independent Scotland.Politicians across the globe are known for their reluctance to admit when they have said something wrong. In Scotland that reluctance has become unhealthily obsessive. The independence project is built on the precarious assumption that its leaders are never wrong about anything, and so whatever the First Minister says must be right, always. The aim is to instill in voters an unquestioning confidence in the SNP, a belief that they are people in whom the fate of a nation can be placed without concern that they will stumble or fumble like other, less perfect political leaders would. If they started going around admitting they had got something wrong, then such confidence would take a serious hit.The problem is that voters can make their own judgement about whether it would be safe to start cutting up fire doors in schools or demanding that English tax-payers start funding the pensions of a foreign country. A public admission of fault could be forgiven. An insistence on pursuing a policy that makes no sense or is deliberately dangerous would be unforgivable.More from NewsCatholic priest showed sexual abuse victim a corpse to intimidate him into silenceBoris Johnson confirms Covid isolation laws will be scrapped later this month at PMQsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Liz Truss warns invasion would trigger \u0026#39severe\u0026#39 sanctions as she lands in MoscowSnow Moon 2022: when it peaks in the UK and other full moon datesJeremy Clarkson backs farmers over ‘utter madness’ of vegan-only food at council meetingsLegal requirement to self-isolate with Covid set to be scrappedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"conservative partys christmas quiz team","story":"Conservative Partys Christmas quiz team name choices slammed as massive jokePrime Minister Boris Johnson faces fresh backlash today after another picture emerged from the virtual Christmas quiz in  - and people arent happy about the team names eitherPrime Minister Boris Johnson is facing fresh backlash today Image: Getty ImagesByJohn BettAudience WriterCourtney PochinSenior Audience Writer:,  Feb |comments Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces fresh backlash today after a new picture emerged showing him at a No  aposvirtualapos Christmas quiz.The new image shows the Prime Minister flanked by three members of staff, one wearing tinsel and another a Santa hat, at the event on December , .

Heres everything you need to know about the DWP rule changes for jobseekersJobseekers are about to have the amount of job-seeking time they have slashed from today Image: Getty ImagesByHarry ThompsonTrends Writer:,  Feb |comments Following a key change to the Department for Work and Pensionspolicy last month, jobseekers will have less time to find a position in their chosen field or risk endangering their Universal Credit claim.The brutal change, which is likely to leave jobseekers feeling increased stress and pressure, means that people looking for work are now expected to broaden their job search. The government says it has introduced the measures in an attempt to get , benefit claimants into jobs by June. But some of them might remain claiming Universal Credit even when they find work,they work part-time or for low wages.According to the latest data from the Office For National Statistics , unemployment rates in the UK have been falling.As of Autumn , the number of over s classed as unemployed had fallen to .%, a .% drop from the pandemic-related spike in late , which saw .% of the workforce without a job. How will the changes to the jobseekersapos allowance affect me   Previously, people were given three months to find a role in the sector they wanted to go into. They are then expected to broaden their search and consider looking at other sectors outside of their preference. However, under new DWP rules they will have less time to find a new job in their chosen field. The three-month window has now been brutally slashed to just one. In a statement, the government said: After four weeks, claimants who refuse to widen their job search, attend interviews or take up paid work in roles outside of their preferred sector may be referred for a sanction. The programme, labelled aposWay to Workapos by the government, says it wants to get half a million people into jobs by the end of June. However, it has faced severe backlash from charities and experts. The plan has come from the DWP, which claims that ONS data reports a % increase in the number of vacancies available compared to pre-pandemic levels. This equates to . million jobs to fill. They say the project will primarily target people who are inside the intensive work search group on Universal Credit.  The DWP say: To support people into work faster those who are capable of work will be expected to search more widely for available jobs from the fourth week of their claim, rather than from three months as is currently the case. This clearer focus will ensure that,people are not able to find work in their previous occupation or sector, they are expected to look for work in another sector and this will be part of their requirements for receiving their benefit payment. For the vast majority of people who are already engaging fully with Jobcentre Plus, this could be the extra support they need to secure a job. However, for the small minority who do not engage, the sanctions regime will operate as usual. The sanctions discussed are likely to be reductions in benefits, rather than total cut-offs, however, there could be scenarios where the money is halted altogether. With job seekers potentially being forced to dash hopes of working in their sectors of choice and taking on an ill-suited role, the benefits of the rule change remain in question. Stephen Evans, Chief Executive of the Learning and Work Institute, said: “This ‘crackdown’ won’t make a signicant impact on those numbers and it’s not where the real challenges lie. “People who’ve recently lost their jobs are the most likely to find work quickly. To tackle current labour shortages, we need a more ambitious plan for people who have left the labour market, with support increasing the longer someone is out of work.” Anastasia Berry of the MS Society added: “Taking a forceful approach will not help everyone, especially disabled people, get into and remain in high quality and appropriate work.Speaking to YourMoney head of policy at Citizens Advice, Morgan Wild, said: “This plan to potentially increase sanctions to get claimants to take any job going might reduce unemployment in the very short term, but really risks the recovery long-term.“When pushed like this, people earn less, work fewer hours and end up quitting sooner. People know what work they’re good at. The state pushing them to take anything will look like a short term win, but ends up hurting productivity because people waste time in the wrong jobs. “And to a large extent it just moves the problem around – people slip out of the benefits system and into being economically inactive altogether. Government should focus on proper re-training etc.rather than this kind of harmful approach.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and Pensions\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She accused energy suppliers of using poor rate-payers “as their cash flow” ahead of the jump to nearly £, per year for the average household. Ms Coffey, who earns £, as an MP and Cabinet minister, told MPs on the Commons Work and Pensions Committee: “I don’t pretend in any way to be poor, I’m not trying to suggest that at all. “But I did notice very signicantly my utility suppliers all of a sudden increased my standing order, anticipating perhaps rises. I’ve had to go back and get them to bring back down my standing order because it’s not in line with my bills.” Suggesting poor benefit claimants could do the same, she said: “People can ask for that to be reviewed and they can go to Ofgemthey want to make a complaint.  “To some extent I think some of the energy suppliers started using bill-payers as their cash flow.” But she accepted the advice might not work for everyone, saying: I donapost want to make assumptions on behalf of all people who receive benefits on how they manage that Iaposm not going to pretend that I can read everybodyaposs meter. Hopefully when people get more smart meters, we will be in a better place on how people can manage that and also how energy companies can be responsive and responsible. It’s believed Ms Coffey was talking about her personal home for which she pays the bills from her own income, rather than her London second home where bills can be claimed from taxpayers. Expenses records suggest the Suffolk Coastal MP claimed £. in electricity bills for her taxpayer-funded London accommodation in  , but has not claimed energy bills since then. Despite acknowledging the huge hike, Ms Coffey said no further support is currently planned for poor Brits beyond a £-a-household package unveiled last week - more than half of which has to be paid back.  Askedthe government thought the package was enough, Ms Coffey - a member of the Cabinet - said: “I think they think the £bn, the Chancellor thinks £bn of support to people in the country is a substantial element.” She added: “There’s already been a signicant increase into the level of support, I’m not aware any more plans are there. That’s not my decision.” Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Therese Coffey’s comments are tone deaf.“It’s jaw dropping coming two days after she imposed punishing real terms cuts in the social security support  the pensions families and the retired rely on. “On top of rocketing heating bills, price going up, wages stagnating and Tory tax rises working people, families and pensioners need real help now like Labour’s £ reduction in energy bills.“Instead we get pathetic special pleading from out of touch ministers who care little that child poverty is rising, food bank use exploded and half a million children don’t have a suitable bed to sleep in at night.”Stephen Timms, Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, added: “The lack of detail that the Secretary of State was able to give us on what the Government is doing to support the many people currently struggling to get by was hugely disappointing.”Ms Coffey also defended a below-inflation benefits and pensions rise of just .% from April  that will raise Universal Credit by only £. a month.“I don’t feel I’m in an impossible position,” she said. “I put forward what I thought was sensible in line with inflation on our usual index, recognising an aspect of consistency - sometimes that will be up, sometimes that will be down.” Ms Coffey said the poorest who aren’t eligible for a £ council tax discount in April can draw on a £m fund to be given out through councils. She added the separate Household Support Fund - also run by councils - is already open for people struggling with bills. But Citizens Advice chief Morgan Wild said: “In lots of situations one advisor has told me it’s like a plaster on a gaping wound. “People who are in serious financial shortfalls, it helps them for a few weeks, but there’s little to address the fundamental issue.”  Robert Joyce of the IFS think tank added council support should be for “edge cases”, not “poor substitutes for creating national policy”. Mr Wild said: “People on low incomes are seeing an incredibly high rise in prices and no commensurate increase in their incomes. “Over the past month Citizens Advice has seen a record demand since the pandemic began of people coming to us for advice. “We’re seeing all time records for crisis support - referrals for food banks and other charitable support - and we’re seeing record numbers for fuel debts. “So we are already at a very elevated level of financial stress for the people coming to us. “That’s in January , before the signicant increase in energy prices comes down the line in April - an average of £ for the average household which many families will not be able to bear.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsCouncil taxEnergy billsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Prospect union says the Government is failing to properly apply the “social value test”, which assesses benefits to communities when handing out lucrative contracts. The union believes the Tories have been too focused on the costs of projects and not taken enough account of the potential impact on workers and wider society.Prospect pointed to the  Ministry of Defence announcement that the UK would equip its new Apache helicopters with missiles made by US firm Lockheed Martin - despite a bid from Stevenage-based MBDA, which employs , staff. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter Prospect has produced a -page report, ‘Social value and the prosperity agenda in defence’, seen exclusively by the Mirror, calling for the social value test to be bolstered to give more weight to non-price considerations and measuring tenders against “key performance indicators” such as jobs, skills and local investment.  Senior deputy general secretary Sue Ferns said: “A more rounded approach would enable the Government to use defence spending strategically to help drive its levelling-up agenda while supporting skills, and reinforcing the UK’s sovereign defence capabilities from design to build.” The union fears a £.billion deal for three naval supply ships could go to a foreign-led bid. The Government has “made clear that a substantial part of the build” for the Fleet Solid Support vessels for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary will “be conducted in the UK” and “there is a requirement to integrate all ships in a UK shipyard”. But that has sparked fears a UK-led consortium could miss out, with much of the work taking place overseas. Ms Ferns added: “The MoD is responsible for around £bn of annual contract expenditure which,directed properly, can have the dual effect of supporting British business and driving the levelling-up agenda.  “To date this potential benefit has not been delivered as well as it ought to be and the Government is failing in its mission to increase the contribution to UK prosperity from defence. The main reason is that headline price is still the primary driver of procurement decisions rather than a holistic assessment that considers the impact on local communities, the economy and climate change alongside headline price.” Shadow Defence Minister Chris Evans said: “The MoD’s procurement system is failing British businesses. “From wasting billions of pounds in cancelled contracts to the social value test not being applied properly, ministers are repeatedly missing opportunities to provide and support local jobs across the country.“Our defence and aerospace industries are national assets and Labour is committed to a ‘British-built by default’ approach to defence procurement which would support the growth of the British defence sector and build resilience in our supply chains.”A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: “Social value tests are undertaken as required in our procurement and any suggestion otherwise is completely incorrect. “These tests are one of many important factors in our procurement as we seek to ensure value for taxpayers’ money, benefit to the UK and securing the best equipment for our Armed Forces.“Defence proudly supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across every corner of the country and in the last year spent over £ billion with UK industry.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Lockheed Martin CorporationMinistry of DefencePublic servicesThe economyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Gillian Keegan said she had taken a precautionary lateral flow test before meeting campaigners Andy Airey, Mike Palmer and Tim Owen, who lost their daughters to suicide. She was informed during the meeting that her result was positive - but admitted that she stayed on to listen to their stories. NHS guidance says people who test positive for Covid should begin isolating immediately.Ms Keegan admitted that remaining in the meeting was an error of judgement in a Twitter thread later that night.The minister tweeted: Earlier today, ahead of a planned visit I took a precautionary LFD test which gave a positive result. I am now isolating at home and fortunately feel fine.  When I was told my test was positive I was listening to three fathers who had tragically lost their daughters to suicide. I told them the result and took further precautions but with their consent, I stayed for a short period to hear their stories. I should have immediately ended the meeting and on reflection this was an error of judgment on my part. I fully recognise the importance of following the letter and spirit of the policies, so want to be upfront about what happened and to apologise for the mistake I made.Health Minister Ed Argar defended her for continuing with a meeting after discovering she had tested positive for Covid-.He told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain: Sheaposs clearly issued a fulsome apology there, that she did make an error of judgment, she was open about that and she accepted she made an error of judgment.A spokesman for Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: The Secretary of State has spoken with the minister who has taken responsibility for her actions and made a full apology.He accepts her apology and continues to support her in her role. Downing Street said she had apologised for her error of judgement but refused to comment further.Read MoreBut Lobby Akinnola, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved families for Justice, branded her actions deeply disturbing. He said: This is completely morally irresponsible behavior. As the families of the over , people who have lost loved ones to Covid- know all too well, Keegan’s actions could have led to someone’s death.It’s deeply disturbing that this came from one of the country’s health ministers. Once again we are seeing those in Government setting a poor example for the rest of the country to follow. The trio of bereaved fathers, who raised £, on a -mile walk last year, met Ms Keegan to call for suicide awareness lessons in schools. Known as Three Dads Walking, the campaigners trekked for  days from Mr Aireyaposs home in Cumbria, to Mr Palmeraposs home in Greater Manchester and on to Mr Owenaposs in Norfolk last October. Hollywood actors Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman were among those who donated to their cause. Mr Palmer, who lost his -year-old daughter Beth to suicide in March , said the minister had acted very responsibly. He said Ms Keegan put a mask on, put further distance between herself and the men, and made arrangements to leave as fast as possible, adding: We have no grievance or problem with the way she acted whatsoever. Mr Palmer added: She doesnapost need to apologise to us in any way, shape or form. Absolutely not.

Suzanne Webb, a minister for Trade, Women and Equalities boasted just look at our record insisting the Government will continue to be the Government of low taxes. Ms Webb claimed removing the VAT on fuel and energy bills would disproportionately benefit wealthier households. But MPs laughed and jeered as she claimed the Tories were solving the crisis. The Resolution Foundation says the measures will leave the average household £ a year worse off, or .% of their disposable income, in  .  And energy bill also rising in April could bring gas and electricity fees to % of the entire budget for Britain’s poorest households - up from .% last year.During the opposition day debate, Labour MPs shared heartbreaking stories of their constituents having to rely on food banks in the st century and families expressing their fears of rising energy bills.Only  Tory MPs showed up to the debate on the cost of living crisis and food insecurity, as the PM reshuffled his team in a bid to shake-up Downing Streetaposs apospartyapos culture. Labouraposs Carolyn Harris shared a heartbreaking message she received from one of her constituents in Swansea East who had been unable to allow their kids to taste brussel sprouts because of food insecurity left unsolved by the Tories. Ian Lavery also shared a message from a single parent in his Wansbeck constituency. The constituency told him: Itaposs dficult to imagine without experiencing it. How tiring being skint is. How youaposre so utterly consumed by financial hardship that it consumes every decision you make on a daily basis. It takes up every thought you make, you canapost escape. No wonder thereaposs a mental health crisis. Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron urged the Government to cut VAT on fuel and energy bills in order to solve the crisis.The only useful thing one could do having left the European Union, the one silver lining and they won’t deploy it, so why not cut VAT on fuel bills and give people that relief that they desperately need, Mr Farron told MPs.There’s too little being done to help those whose need is the greatest.”  But Ms Webb accused opposition MPs of playing the blame game rather than offering solutions to support families and over and actually overlooking what is actually really happening. I am acutely aware of the challenges my constituents are currently facing. With cost of living and rice on food and energy bills. This is an international issue that countries everywhere are facing. Iaposm surprised that the opposition decry the government presiding over falling wages and the lack of job opportunities. Why is it not this conservative government that introduced the national living wage in  , before adding Iaposm surprised that the motion limits the government supposethis government will continue to be the government of low taxes. MPs jeered and laughed in unison but she pressed on. I am pleased that this government is being honest with people by proposing practical policies to support families with rising energy prices, Ms Webb added. Hours before the opposition day debate took place, experts warned people will struggle to eat and heat their homes as they pay around £million worth of lost consumer cash from collapsed energy companies. Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy at the National Energy Action charity told the Business, Energy and Industry Committee that Brits on the lowest incomes will be the hardest hit by the tax hikes from April, as they reside in the least-fuel efficient homes. Mr Smith also warned: “People used to talk about the choice between heating or eating. It’s getting to a situation where people won’t be able to do either satisfactorily.  He expects . million households will not be able to keep their homes warm despite the Government’s latest proposals. Energy bills are set to increase by % from April for millions of households across the country. It could equate to a rise of £ per year for the average household. Jim McMahon Shadow Environment and Food Secretary accused the Government of actively making matters worse as Brits are struggling to afford food in the cost of living crisis. Ms Harris told MPs a family in her constituency thanked her for running a campaign that allowed them to celebrate Christmas. “They usually rely on food banks and whilst they are extremely grateful to the food banks, they said it felt amazing not to feel like it’s charity stuff with black marks on the tins.They felt overwhelmed they had been able to give their children a proper Christmas dinner without tinned potatoes. Their two-year-old child had never tasted a fresh potato, let alone a brussel sprouts or a parsnip.”Shadow Environment and Food Secretary Jim McMahon blasted the Tories for making the crisis actively worse - their lack of inaction forcing people to rely on food banks. Tory MP for Peterborough Paul Bristow shouted thataposs what food banks do in the chamber. Despite this, Mr McMahon added: Food banks rely on the charity of our neighbours. Thataposs a reality. How are we going to tackle the cost of living crisis when our neighbours are struggling to secure food too  In the same debate, Tory MP Lee Anderson was accused of intimidation for calling Labouraposs Mr Lavery a coward. Mr Anderson insulted Mr Lavery after his repeated requests to intervene during the opposition day debate.At the start of the day, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle warned MPs their words have consequences after Labour leader Keir Starmer was hounded by a mob near Parliament.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyBoris JohnsonEnergy billsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On the desk in front of him - from where he read out quiz questions to teams across the building - is what appears to be champagne and a half-eaten packet of crisps. Mr Johnson was accused of personally breaking Covid laws by hosting the festive event after the Mirror revealed last year that it had taken place. At the time London was under Tier  regulations banning any social mixing between two or more people from dferent households.  Official guidance also stated: “You must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” Just two days after the Mirroraposs initial story, the PM said: “I can tell you once again that I certainly broke no rules. But the Christmas quiz is not one of the dozen No  gatherings under investigation by police. This is despite a smaller festive quiz held in the Cabinet Office just two days later being looked at. One Covid laws expert said that Scotland Yard should now add the Downing Street Christmas quiz to the list of events it is probing. Barrister Adam Wagner told The Mirror: The previous photograph of the Prime Minister showed what could have been a meeting briefly interrupted by a Zoom call. However, the new photograph shows four people with alcohol and food, as well as a Christmas hat and tinsel, which suggests a Christmas party. This was held at a time when indoor social gatherings of two or more people were banned and the Government had told people they must not have a Christmas party. The top lawyer added: In light of the new evidence it now makes no sense for this gathering not to be investigated by the police given that an almost identical gathering in the Cabinet Secretary Simon Caseaposs office two dayaposs later is being investigated. In the new image, Mr Johnson appears to be putting a badge on his suit jacket.  Later that evening, No  pins were distributed to Downing Street staff as a Christmas present from the PM. Downing Street has insisted the event was a “virtual quiz”, but admitted “those who were in the office for work may have attended virtually from their desks.” Labour MP Fabian Hamilton raised the photo in PMQs - and contrasted the merriment to a constituent who was unable to have visits from her family while having cancer treatment. He said: For the sake of my constituent and the sacrices she made, will the PM be referring this party to the police as itaposs not one of the parties being investigated  But the PM hit back, saying: He is completely in error. He later said the event had been submitted for investigation. Former No aide Dominic Cummings warned: Thereaposs waaaaay better pics than that floating around, incl in the flat. No pointed out the event itself had already been considered by Scotland Yard, which decided not to investigate it further. But the PM’s Press Secretary could not say whether the newly-revealed photo had been sent to the Met, saying: “I’m not aware of that and it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment”. Of Sue Gray, the Press Secretary added: “She has had access to all information that is relevant and required.” Asked what was happening in the picture, she said: Weaposve talked about this one before, it is a virtual quiz. The Mirror revealed last year that dozens of staff had spent the evening huddling in groups around their office computers rather than dialling in from home. In one office, the insider said, there were four teams, each made up of six people. Sources said staff had knocked back fizz, wine and beer - and some stayed in Number  socialising and drinking for hours after the quiz finished at .pm. Team names included Professor Quiz Whitty, Next Slide Please, Weaposve Been Clear”, “The  Masketeers” and Hands, Face, First Place - a reference to the slogan introduced to encourage social distancing and mask wearing.  The Mirror also revealed an email showing organisers had planned days in advance for some staff to enjoy the quiz in person, from the office. A senior official even urged staff, including teams from the PMaposs private office, the policy unit and the press office, to leave No  through the back door at the end of the night. Mr Johnson has spent the last few days trying to shore up support after mass resignations from No  last week raised further questions about his authority. Downing Street is hoping his defensive mini-reshuffle to promote loyalists - and the promise of a bigger reshuffle in early summer - will be enough to keep mutinous Tory MPs at bay. But many Tories are privately saying they are waiting for the result of the Met investigation and the full Sue Gray report to decide whether to trigger a confidence vote. The PMaposs allies have claimed that he will not resign evenhe is fined by the politan Police for breaching Covid rules. One former Cabinet minister told the Mirror: “If Sue Gray finds he lied to parliament unequivocally, or depending what action police take - that’s it. Either of those two things would be terminal.

Small loans announced by the Government – that must be repaid by us – are cold comfort after the energy price cap was lted £. Labour deserves congratulations for backing a windfall tax and suspension of VAT. Even Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron imposed one-off levies on North Sea producers. The resistance of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to a similar move means this Government is siding with big corporations against working people.  Sinking ship Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle rebuked lying Boris Johnson over his Jimmy Savile smear against Keir Starmer He showed how an unprincipled Prime Minister exploits Parliament loopholes. The Speaker judging the slur inappropriate rather than disorderly showed how Johnson will be dishonest but avoid punishment. What’s more, his incitement fuelled a mob to abuse the Labour leader. The PM’s desperate mini-reshuffle was a reshuffling of diehards in the deckchairs on board his sinking Government ship. Unconditional support isn’t repaid by Johnson when he demoted fanatical defender Jacob Rees-Mogg from Leader of the House to an invented Brexit Opportunities post as a middle-ranking minister of state, albeit invited to sit in the Cabinet room with his superiors. Once again we witness Johnson caring only about himself. Conservative MPs should throw him overboard to save themselves. A Brit special Brits starring in Oscar nominations and at tonight’s Brits awards is great news. When it comes to films and music, we’re seen and heard all around the globe.

There can be no doubt that MPs of all stripes are well aware of the realities of the cost of living crisis we face.That’s why the Labour Party tabled a motion in the Commons, putting forward suggestions on how to tackle an inflation crisis of the Conservatives’ own making. We urged the government to set out a national strategy for food, including how it intends to ensure access to high quality, sustainable, affordable food for all and meet the United Nations goal to end hunger by .Yet not a single Cabinet minister bothered to turn up until the th hour – too busy shuffling the deckchairs on the prime minister’s doomed vessel, as he scrabbles to save his job.  Those who are responsible are failing to do anything about the spiralling cost of your weekly shop, brought about in no small part by their failure to make Brexit work and properly support British suppliers and producers. It’s becoming something of a pattern for this government. No accountability and no grip on reality. Far too many of us know all too well the consequences of not being able to afford to live. As I told the House, the darkness of poverty isn’t just not being able to turn the lights on. It’s being driven into debt and despair, keeping your curtains are closed even in the day-time - because you’re fearful of the debt collector knocking on the door. Labour has set out a plan to cut the cost of energy bills, saving the poorest households about £. The time for this government to refocus its efforts is long overdue. Labour’s contract of security, prosperity and respect with the British people will end the cycle of high tax and low growth that has mired working families in perpetual instability for the last decade. We have set out a fully costed plan to keep bills low and support British business to bolster sustainability and affordability of good quality food. The Tories now stand on their record. They’re all out of ideas, their leader has run out of road and the British people have run out of patience.

One said he cannot afford to buy food and another added: We canapost keep living this way. Another said he was cutting back on what he does for his kids and is worried about fuel bills. Coventry bin lorry drivers have been on strike over pay since Christmas and are now taking part in a full-blown strike until March . It was originally planned to be a strike on some days but after negotiations broke down between union Unite and Coventry City Council, a full strike was announced. The drivers - none of whom were named in a Unite video - shared their experiences ahead of a cost of living crisis rally taking place in March in Manchester. One striking bin driver from Coventry said: Rising costs have affected myself, my family, my close relatives, to be honest with you. We canapost keep living this way - weaposve got no money to spend on food, gas and electric has gone up three times. Coventry City Council have previously told CoventryLive they have had their pay offers rejected by Unite, and maintain they are one of the highest paying local authorities in the West Midlands for Class II HGV drivers. The Bank of England has warned of the steepest drop in living standards for  years as the cost of living crisis worsens. Interest rates are predicted to soar to . per cent by April, meaning the cost of everyday items will shoot up, while wages will stay the same. The concerned bin driver added: We canapost have it, we just canapost have it, weaposve got to stand up now and say enough is enough.  Another Coventry bin driver, also speaking at the Whitley depot, said: Weaposve had to be doing some cutbacks for quite a long time now. Weaposre also obviously quite worried around our fuel bills, and things like that. Weaposre both working, and weaposre both in full time work, and weaposre absolutely finding it a complete and utter struggle. Weaposre having to cut down our journeys, because obviously we canapost afford fuel for the car, so weaposre having to use them for essential journeys. Although weaposre not actually going hungry, thereaposs lots of things we have to cut back on, and I find it really sad and disillusioned that I have to cut back on activities for my children. The video was posted by Unite West Midlands who spoke to bin drivers in Manchester and Coventry about the cost of living in comparison to their wages. The cost of living crisis is currently being influenced by a number of factors, including higher energy costs, shortages of some goods, rising costs of food and fuel and wages not rising in line with this.

The bizarre dispute, branded aposFence-gateapos by locals, went viral around the world last September. But as the row intensied, Stephen, , claimed an outraged man aimed an airgun at Christine before firing.  The couple, who used to run a sweet shop from the property, were so spooked they removed the fence a week later. They are now selling the three-bed semi-detached house for £,. Land Registry records show the house was bought for £, in  - a whopping £, more than the current asking price. Christine, , who works in a nursing home, said relations with her neighbours had gone sour since the fence row. She said: We were going to sell the house beforehand but whataposs gone on has soured it a bit. We were going to sell the house but it brought it all forward.  We took the fence down th September, it was up for a week. We just want to move on with it.I got trolled on Facebook. Some of the comments we saw were awful.Recalling the moment a yob fired an air rle at Christine, she said: To think the guy who shot at me got away with that. I said to my husband aposthat guys got a gunapos The minute he aimed at me, Stephen dragged me inside. Stephen added: Weaposve had people eating their chips on our windowsill and looking through the window while we are trying to relax. Itaposs not on. Most people wouldnapost want people using their land as a footpath and neither do we. We just wanted to protect our property. The couple ran a sweet shop up until , but closed and converted it into a living room. Estate agent Pattinson, who are selling the house, say the property has so many potential options. In the particulars, they say: Perhaps it will become a beautul and substantial family home, maybe with a separate granny annex, or split into two separate dwellings. Maybe the former shop could once again be put back into service, and what could be done with the garage...  The mind boggles.

The building, which dates back to , was used as a home for the orphaned children of sailors but it has been empty for nearly  years, reports Glasgow Live. The old school, commonly known as the Balrossie Orphanage, is about  miles west of Glasgow.It was paid a visit by an urban explorer who captured the crumbling ruins and creepy atmosphere in a series of snaps. Kyle Urbex, the Leeds-based photographer and urban explorer has visited dozens of abandoned sites over the past  months. He said the orphanage had been on his list for quite a while.Kyle said the old orphanage looked like it would soon be gone forever, so he was glad to be able to visit last week, while there was still something left to see. He said: I arrived [at Balrossie] last Saturday and when I first got there I noticed that half of the building had already been demolished. There was a big massive pile of rubble in the middle.I reckon the rest of it will be gone very, very soon. I can imagine itaposll be gone within the next few months, or something like that. Thataposs why I go exploring to capture all these forgotten buildings before theyaposre gone forever. Amidst all the rubble and debris, signs of the old schoolaposs former use were evident, despite it having closed back in . The site has repeatedly been the target for vandals, and, in , the buildingaposs fate was sealed when it was subject to an arson attack. Following the resulting blaze, which was attended to by more than  firefighters, a building inspection was carried out and the Balrossie school was declared unsafe.  Parts of the building have since been demolished, with more of the structure to follow suit. Due to the Balrossieaposs deteriorating condition, Kyle admitted his latest Scottish excursion was particularly dangerous and that he had to make extra sure certain parts were stable before proceeding. It was quite dangerous. Essentially itaposs a construction site. The second building I went in didnapost have an upstairs, as the floor had already caved in. I tried walking up the stairway, but it was literally starting to fall apart. I do take extra precautions. For example,Iaposm upstairs in a building and it feels quite weak then Iaposll always put something thataposs heavier than myself there first just to make sure.Since starting up his risky hobby back in June , Kyle said he has visited  abandoned buildings and regularly posts his photos on Instagram and Facebook.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsArsonAbandoned placesGlasgow City\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Humans naturally gravitate towards animals that look like our babies, with round heads, big eyes and flat faces.But our growing desire for dog breeds with these characteristics is causing them immense suffering, with their genetically pre-disposed health issues requiring a letime of expensive and stressful surgeries and medication. Last week, Norway announced the selective breeding of British Bulldogs and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels has been banned in a landmark ruling against the aposcruelapos process.Oslo District Court ruled that reproducing the two breeds breaches the Animal Welfare Act in Norway. The court ruled that the practice leads to man-made health issues for the animals after lawyers argued it was no longer possible to maintain the health of the breeds. Getthe newsyou want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here The new ruling added that breeders who work towards closing the door on the animalsapos health problems can continue, bringing some hope for lovers of the two breeds in Norway. British Bulldogs and aposCavviesapos have a brachycephalic face, meaning their skull is compressed and flat - and so are the structures inside it. This means they not only have a lot of folds around their faces which causes skin issues, but major breathing problems. Flat-faced dogs have rocketed in popularity in recent years with a , per cent increase in ownership in the UK of French Bulldogs alone since , according to figures from Kennel Club. But  per cent of short nosed dog owners could not recognise signs that their pet was having breathing dficulties, according to a study by the Royal Veterinary College in . The health issues are deeply unpleasant for the dog and for the owners, who witness the suffering and must fork out for treatment - and itaposs tough for the vets who operate on the suffering puppies, day in day out.I spoke to Tavishi Pandya, a -year-old vet who graduated in  and works in Waltham Forest. She thinks Norwayaposs ban is a step forward - but warned it could encourage back-door breeders to continue underground, making the situation even worse. The way we have bred these dogs is forcing them to live a le where they are under unnecessary stress, says Tav. On hot days, you use your whole nose to cool the air down, but Bulldogs canapost do that, so they suffer a lot with heatstroke. The dogs end up suffering from BOAS , where their soft palette goes over their upper glottis, and causes the loud snorting breaths we associate with flat-faced dogs. Tav points out that while we might think these noises are adorable and that they indicate the dog is happy, what it really means is they are struggling for breath. Imagineyou had to breathe with a plastic bag over your head all the time, she says.There is always an element of respiratory distress because they have to fight a lot harder to maintain their oxygen levels. Sothey are put under stress, we see a lot of collapses, they canapost run around like normal dogs can and they get out of breath. Tav explains that over time, the snorting sound the pups make begins to affect the structures in their throats and makes them swell up. Iaposve seen many cases where their throats are so swollen the dogs are at risk of collapse and death, she says. All of these things are a completely man-made problem. Meanwhile, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels can also suffer with Brachycephalic airway disease, though not to the same extent.They are more susceptible to heart defects, eye disease, joint problems and chronic headaches or syringomyelia - a neurological condition caused by their brains being too big to fit in their skull.This is painful and distressing for owners, says Tav. Their brains are essentially being squished.  She explained the dogs will often struggle with their balance and with neck pain. aposCavviesapos are also genetically disposed to heart conditions which means they are much more prone to congestive heart failure, something Tav sees every day. Youaposre breeding a dog and you know for a fact thereaposs a high risk that later on in le it will have to be on medication just so it can breathe, and its lespan is much reduced, she says. Itaposs stressful for owners, the dogs, and itaposs expensive to fix. Tav says itaposs heartbreaking to have to put a young dog to sleep because of the issues that come from selective breeding, and to have to tell owners that their new puppy is going to be unwell for most of its le. We are selfish, we are breeding them like this just because we like the way they look, she adds.  British Bulldogs, French Bulldogs and Pugs have similar issues, says Tav. They have major skin issues - they are so uncomfortable. Imagine being itchy your entire le, and getting infections so often you need antibiotics every month or every other month, she says. We donapost want animals on medication all the time, thataposs not our goal. But weaposre fighting with genetics, so itaposs out of our control. Why breed them this way  Tav believes there is a lack of education about the issues that come with certain dog breeds, and owners are often shocked to learn their new addition to the family will need major surgery once itaposs fully grown just so it can breathe slightly better. Iaposve come across many owners who have been hit with these vet bills and health concerns, and they tell me, aposIf I had known this before, I would never have bought the breed,apos she says.  Soyouaposre thinking about getting a puppy - get a healthy breed. We arenapost saying thereaposs a breed with absolutely no health conditions guaranteed, but why pick a breed where the risk factors are so much higher  It makes our job ten times harder, and owners often donapost understand until the situation is very, very bad. Sometimes owners even accuse Tav and her colleagues, who donapost work on commission, of money-grabbing and suggesting unnecessary treatment. That can definitely take a toll on you, having to go over these things with owners who are just ill-informed and unaware, she added. A happy checkup has to be taken to quite a serious place where I have to warn the owner to keep an eye on their dogaposs breathing all the time, anditaposs making noises when itaposs running around having fun, you need to stop the fun - I donapost want to have to advise that. Itaposs upsetting to know what these dogs are going to have to go through in le, they will suffer. Asked whether she thinks the Norway ban should be brought to the UK, Tav warns an absolute ban opens the door to underground breeders selling the dogs, which would make the situation even worse. Instead, she thinks breeders should work to eradicate these common health issues, with certication and a protocol that ensures only healthy dogs are bred from.Tav suggested a breeding license that gives a certicate of health to the Bulldogs and the Cavvies, similar to the recently-passed Lucyaposs Law, which made it illegal for third party dealers, such as pet shops and online traders, to sell puppies.Tav is quick to point out she and her colleagues love the dogs themselves, and she doesnapost believe the breeds should be totally banned - but the health issues must be bred out of them. We arenapost saying get rid of the breed, we are just saying please breed them in a way that they donapost have all these issues - breed them with longer noses, she adds. When they are very badly bred, they can collapse and die at any point.Do you have a story to share  Email webfeatures@trinitymirrorRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Animals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The most pleasurable part was getting up the beach before anyone . We saw deer, rabbits and foxes on the beach. The feeling is is a real privilege. It is so special.He also said that seeing porpoises and seals were a common occurrence. We saw the sand dunes develop, he said. We saw a whole ecosystem reclaiming the land from the sea.

Ashley Wadsworth was found dead on February  at the home of her English boyfriend Jack Sepple who has since been charged with her murder. Ms Wadsworth, of Vernon in British Columbia, moved to the UK in November on a six-month tourist visa. It is understood she was due tohome on Thursday, two days after her death. Since Saturday, , Canadian dollarshas been donated on a Go Fund Me page organised by Jadine Wakefield, as the family faced financial strains... to bring their beautul Ashley home.Ms Wakefield, a friend of the family, wrote: Ashley was a precious part of the Wadsworth family. Her spontaneous and witty personality, along with her unforgettable laugh, brought so much joy to those around her. Every mother and father wish the best for their children as they spread their wings and enter the world. They want them to live their best le! Ashley was doing just that, and thataposs how we want to remember her. She said there was a tremendous cost associated with bringing Ms Wadsworthaposs body back to Canada. Sepple appeared in court on Friday and spoke only to confirm his name and no plea was entered to the charge. During the hearing Judge Christopher Morgan set a provisional trial date for September . He said the trial is expected to last two to three weeks.  Sepple, of Chelmsford, was remanded in custody and is due to enter a plea at the same court on March . Paying tribute to Ashley, her great aunt Tova Wadsworth said that she was on the trip of a letime after arriving in the UK from her home in Vernon, British Columbia in November last year. She said: Ashley was a beautul young lady and full of love and kindness for all in her le. This was a trip of a letime... Nothing of this makes any sense. Her family is heartbroken and struggles to understand. Ashleyaposs friends in Canada shared tributes and photos of her and paid heartbreaking tributes.  Alongside a set of smiling graduation photos, best friend Tianna Kowalchuk said: Probably one of the worst feelings is losing your best friend. A best friend is more than a boyfriend, a sibling and even a parent. A best friend is someone you can genuinely tell everything to. It’s someone you can tell about stuff that you may not even be able to tell your parents. It’s someone who will never judge you for needing to vent or rant about something that is bothering you. It’s someone you always feel comfortable around. I’m sorry there wasn’t more I or anyone  could do to help you.

Charlene McKerrow, , defied her Criminal Behaviour Order  times and stole more than £, items from high street stores.She appeared on a police most wanted list and clocked up  offences and repeatedly went on the run, sleeping on sofas at the homes of friends in Bolton, Greater Manchester.This week, despite being branded a high risk of reoffending by probation officers, McKerrow was given  months jail suspended for two years after she insisted she was now battling to get herself clean whilst on remand behind bars.At Bolton Crown Court, she appeared via video link from Styal Womenaposs Prison in Cheshire as she admitted  breaches of a CBO and seven offences of the theft.Sentencing Judge Tom Gilbart told her: You have an appalling history for stealing from shops and repeated anti-social criminality. It is well know how hard it is been for town centre shops in the last few years and for frontline staff in particular and you were persistently going into them to steal. But you have very troubling and sad personal history and have never had counselling or therapy for your mental health issues relating to your childhood experiences. Instead you habitually entered into violent or abusive relationships and you have problems with your accommodation. I have reflected long and hard about your situation but you have now attempted to move away from your drug use and accommodation has been found for you. But you know what will happen to youyou fail to do what is expected of you. The graph curve of human improvement is rarely a straight line and perhaps the easier option would be to send you to prison but the best outcome in the interests of the public would be for you to take this opportunity and address your long standing issues with drugs. I suspect other judges might not have given you this opportunity.  The court heard McKerrow was said to have led a chaotic lestyle due to domestic violence she witnessed at home whilst growing up. She was placed in care and left school at  with no qualications. During her criminal career she attacked passengers on a bus, went on a foul mouthed rampage at a takeaway and was involved in a robbery in which  year old girl had a can of beer poured over her head before she was robbed of her mobile phone. Of the  offences,  involved thefts and  were breaches of court orders and she had been given conditional discharges, community orders and suspended sentences. In  she was jailed for five years and three months for wounding after she smashed a bottle of lager in the face of another woman leaving her scarred for le and needing  stitches.  Following her release she kept dodging parole and supervision appointments and in December  she was issued with a two year CBO for three shoplting offences, two public order matters and harassment. The order meant McKerrow was banned from Bolton town centre shops but in the ensuring months she was seen frequenting her old haunts and she repeatedly stole from local stores claiming she had a kne hidden in her pocket. Miss Gwen Henshaw prosecuting said: Between June and November , she stole from ious shops and on occasion left the victims in fear by claiming she was in possession of a kne whilst she took items. In a pharmacy she lted several items off shelves and hid them under a blanket. When challenged she said she had a kne and left without attempting to pay. She then ed to the same store two hours later to steal more items but this time was not challenged as the staff were so fearful that she might use the knechallenged. There were deliberate and persistent breaches of the Criminal Behaviour Order. During her spree McKerrow also preyed on stores including Clinton Cards, Poundland, Aldi, Card Factory and stole around £ pounds worth of items. She was arrested and locked up last November. In mitigation defence lawyer Nick Ross said his client had prescribed the heroin substitute methadone. He added: She understands that continuing to conduct herself in this way is wholly unacceptable. But there has been a sea-change in her le since she was remanded. She has been doing her utmost to the turn the boat round and start a high level of engagement with her methadone reduction programme. She is highly motivated -she given a chance andshe blows it, she will hand herself in. McKerrow will also have to complete a nine month drug rehabilitation programme and was made subject of a new CBO for five years. She will have to report back to the judge every six weeks as part of court checks on her progress.

Concerned locals have been posting images of the mass fish deaths to social media, after they began washing up along the banks. One man even posted a video to YouTube revealing he had witnessed the fish dying right in front of him. He said in the clip: I just witnessed a massive fish kill. I knew there was something wrong. I could tell from the start when I started fishing that there was something wrong. “Later on I started catching prawns by hand. When prawns come up like that you know there’s something wrong.  “I started to look more and more, all of a sudden I started seeing all these dead fish and the fish were dying in front of my very eyes, they were rolling up on the bank. I pushed a few back in but there were thousands and thousands of dead fish.” The fish and prawns were spotted in Haslams Creek flowing into Homebush Bay and thousands more were found dead on the Parramatta River in Rydalmere also in the city. Experts believe strong storms washed twigs and leaves into river, which combined with water temperatures, had likely triggered a drop in oxygen causing the fish to become starved of oxygen and die.  Environment Protection Authority in New South Wales has said they are thought to have died of natural causes. The events were likely due to natural causes, the EPA said, with preliminary investigations suggesting Sunday’s fish kill was due to storm runoff. Preliminary investigations indicate low oxygen levels were not caused by chemical pollution and were more likely due to natural causes, the EPA said in a statement. Read more Observations by EPA Officers indicate low oxygen levels were caused by high intensity storms that washed organic matter into the waterway, which combined with elevated water temperatures, has caused the fish deaths, the EPA statement said.

But he now says with the worst of the crisis seemingly over, itaposs likely theyaposll be out and about more in the community, where theyaposve made a number of celebrity friends. He told the Evening Standard : Harry’s been out on his bicycle and walking his adopted Labrador on Miramar Beach and she’s been out shopping in both the upper village and lower village and they seem to be very, very happy as far as I can see.”They’ve made a lot of friends here, particularly Orlando and Katy who live nearby on Park Lane.

There has been speculation Harry and Meghan couldto the UK for the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June.Since leaving for America, Harry has ed to the UK twice - for Prince Philipaposs funeral and to unveil a statue of his late mother Princess Diana.Meghan has yet towith son Archie, while daughter Lilibet, was born in America and has never been to England. Last month, royal sources revealed Charles has offered an olive branch to Harry by inviting his family to stay with him when they next visit the UK. However, it then emerged that Harry claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the royal family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. Harry, , has since decided to sue the British government by applying for a judicial review against the decision, which could see him face the Home Office at the court.

It was exactly a year ago that the couple welcomed their baby son into the world - and his middle name Philip pays tribute to his late great-grandfather Prince Philip. Royal fans usually get their first glimpse of a new arrival through an official photocall - with the Duchess of Cambridge and even Sarah Ferguson - Eugenieaposs mum - showing off their newborns on leaving hospital. However, this time last year, Eugenie broke tradition by posting the first sweet image of August on her Instagram account. Eugenie shared the adorable photo of August, showing his hands with those of his mum and dad alongside a caption of three blue hearts. However, there was also an official statement from Buckingham Palace, which read: Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie was safely delivered a son today, th February , at :hrs at The Portland Hospital. Jack Brooksbank was present. The baby weighs lbs oz.

Flight FR had been meant to take off at .pm local time but the plane was delayed by  minutes after a passenger became disruptive on board.Other passengers on the Ryanair flight said man’s behaviour became “hysterical” after airline crew tried to take away bottles of booze he was clutching.One said that people were “afraid” of the man’s worrying behaviour, including removing his trousers because he said he was too hot. A passenger, whose we was sitting near the man, said she had recounted to him how he took his trousers off shortly after sitting down and proceeded to become more disorderly, the Irish Mirror reports.Nobody noticed anything when he got on, he didnapost seem too bad but when he sat down he got up and took off his trousers, he said.[My we] said that he said to the woman beside him that he gets very hot on the plane, and then she said to me, aposI kind of copped then he was under the weather.He had bottles on his lap, maybe four or five litres of spirits, and the stewardess asked to take them off him because she wanted to stow them up safely. But he wouldnapost let them go, he said they were presents and they werenapost taking them and he got a bit hysterical then. Then they called the other cabin steward and he came down and they were just trying to pacy him and he got a bit abusive then and told them he couldnapost take his stuff and he had rights. The doors to the aircraft had already been closed at this stage, with cross-check completed and the plane ready to pull away from the stand. While the man had put on his trousers again at this point, someone then made the decision to have him removed from the plane as he refused to cooperate with anything, the passenger added. As [my we] was saying from chatting with people afterwards, thank God they got him off becausehe was like that now, what would he have been like in an houraposs time into the flight, he said. [The cabin crew] handled it extremely well, there was no big bust-up, there was no violence. It was three policemen who came on first, then there was another three, so I donapost know whether they thought he was going to get rough or not. As he was being escorted from the plane, the man then made a big deal about a suitcase which led to more delays. However, it emerged that he had not in fact placed any luggage in the hold. While people were mostly peed off by the incident, they were also worried about whether the situation could escalate, he explained. People were afraid, they were more afraid of what could have happenedthe stewardess had not intervened because he was getting lairy, he said. He wasnapost threatening anyone...but you never know,it was an hour into the flight it would have been twice as bad. After the man was removed from the aircraft, the flight departed Alicante and subsequently landed in Dublin Airport at .pm local time, just  minutes later than scheduled. A spokesperson for Ryanair said: “This flight from Alicante to Dublinwas delayed ahead of take-off after a passenger became disruptive on board. Crew alerted local police who removed the passenger from the aircraft, and the flight departed following a short delay of approx.  mins. Ryanair apologises to affected passengers for this delay.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RyanairTrousersDublin Airport\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The news comes in the fallout of an unprecedented number of cases following the huge surge of the Omicronwave of the virus. The advice is particularly aimed at workplaces in the hope of helping manage staff shortages. The advice states that people who have recently had Covid should not take a PCR test after having had the virus within a certain timeframe. This is because people who have recently had the virus could still test positive for some time after they had it.  The government says this is because some parts of the virus can remain in the body for long periods of time.They say: Fragments of inactive virus can be persistently detected by PCR in respiratory tract samples following infection, and for some time after a person has completed their isolation period and is no longer infectious. How long do you need to wait to take a PCR test   People who have had covid are being advised not to take a PCR test for  days, or around three months after they had covid unless they meet certain conditions. Failure to listen to this advice could mean you have to isolate again despite not being infectious because it is the legal duty of anyone who tests positive to stay at home. The aim of the new advice is to prevent the ongoing shortfalls in workforces in an attempt to help the country recover from the virus.Documentation .pdf\" rel\"nofollow\" target\"_self\" from the Department of Health  Social Care says: Following a substantial clinical review of the latest evidence and testing data, we are now changing the advice for retesting within  days of a positive. From now on,someone tests positive with a PCR test, they should not be tested using PCR or LFD for  days.What conditions mean you DO need to take a PCR after having Covid   People who develop new symptoms in the  day period will need to take a test once again. The Department of Health  Social Care says that tests should be taken by those who have recovered inside the three month periodthey develop symptoms, in which case they should be retested immediately using PCR. The documentation continues: This  day period is from the initial onset of symptoms or,asymptomatic when tested, their positive test result. The reasoning for the change is explained by the Department: The previous policy to continue LFD testing following a positive PCR result was because although very unlikely, it is possible to be reinfected within  days. However based on the latest testing data and clinical advice, the policy has now changed. The clinical view is that during this  day window from a positive test, given the low rate of reinfection during this window, it is signicantly more likely that a positive LFD test would be a  result, rather than someone being re-infected, causing people to isolate unnecessarily.The NHS also add that people may need to get a PCR within the  day periodthey are required to take one after arriving in the UK from abroad.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus testing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mercedes said she was left vomiting and feeling faint at the sight and she has now vowed to ditch meat altogether following her Sunday dinner debacle. Mercedes, who works as a team leader in a care home and lives in Bedford, said: I honestly didnapost even process it at first.My housemate heard me making a weird noise and she knew something was wrong. I think it was the shock. At first, it was disbelief and almost funny because I was shocked but then reality set in and I went very faint and was physically sick. I havenapost eaten since and Iaposm now really put off meat.”  Mercedes had finished a sht at work and offered to cook her housemate Amy, her boyfriend and his best friend a roast for dinner. Buying all of the ingredients at her local Lidl, she put the roast chicken straight into the oven still in the bag as per the instructions so didnapost notice the foot until it was time to carve the meat. Following the shock incident that almost made her faint in the kitchen, Mercedes has barely been able to eat and is now ditching meat altogether.  She said: My body was shaky and I felt so faint that I couldnapost stomach eating after being sick but had to force myself to eat a few mouthfuls as I hadnapost eaten all day. I will absolutely never eat meat again. Every time Iaposve been in my kitchen since it happened, I gag. Mercedes has issued a formal complaint to Lidl who have contacted the supplier of the chicken and have told her to expect a response in the next  days. A spokesperson for Lidl said: We were very sorry to hear of this matter, as it is never our intention for a customer to be dissatisfied in any way. We work very closely with our suppliers to ensure that the fresh meat we offer is of the highest possible quality for our customers. We were therefore disappointed that our expected high standards have not been met on this occasion.

Brocarde, , a singer and songwriter from Oxfordshire, has spoken of the numerous obstacles she faces to marry her partner Edwardo - the ghost of a Victorian soldier. They met last year after he first appeared at her home and are now set to wed, despite their struggles to find a suitable property to marry in. “Edwardo and I are currently arguing over the wedding date,” Brocarde said. “I want a summer wedding but he hates the heat and I’d secretly love to make him melt, but he disappears often enough as it is. “For weeks, we got nowhere with it, so I’m going to design an Oujia board of wedding dates, to see which we are both drawn to. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here “I swear he’s turned into a complete groomzilla and his list of demands grows daily. “Edwardoaposs always had a temperamental nature but the nuptials seem to be bringing out the worst in him. The pair communicate through unique methods, with the ghost sending cryptic messages in the shower. She said: “Edwardo still leaves subliminal messages in the shower and shows his emotions by sending hot and cold sensations through my body. “Whatever it is I need to ask him, he finds a way of communicating back. It doesn’t just lay in the perimeters of what some people class as ‘normal’ – but who wants normal ” But it can be dficult for a human to marry a ghost, with the couple shunned from churches believing their romance is blasphemous. Brocarde said: Finding the venue is proving really tricky. We’ve been kicked out of a few churches and have been threatened with exorcism already, I want a huge white wedding but a lot of people just can’t see the vision. “Edwardo has made a few appearances but there’s an overwhelming sense that he doesn’t feel comfortable in churches, it’s far too risky for him.”  She claims to have had “fascinating” discussions about religion and the paranormal with priests but believes the church can’t publicly endorse such beliefs. She added: “I refuse to consider any of the typical rules and boundaries, as this isn’t a typical romance. “I’ve applied a ‘DIY’ mentality to everything – I’ve even designed my own wedding dress, which pays homage to the Victorian era. “Edwardo has insisted that I make him a Victorian three-piece suit and I’ve played around with a few ideas but ultimately, I just can’t see it. “I’d prefer him to surprise me and pull a mourning suit from his old wardrobe.” The guest list is also dficult to nail down, what with many of Edwardoaposs friends no longer alive and his best man stuck in hell . The couple is also inviting some celebrities including the ghosts of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis and The Bard. She said: “My dream is to have an eclectic combination of souls at the wedding. “I have a blatant disregard to whether they are classied as alive or dead – at this point, it barely seems relevant. “We’re going to invite our favourite historical characters, such as Elvis and Marilyn Monroe. “William Shakespeare would be warmly welcomed, particularlyhe’s reading a sonnet, so long as he doesnapost re-enact Hamlet. On my special day, I donapost have four hours to spare for someone aposs drama. “Edwardo desperately wants one of his fellow soldiers to be his best man, but apparently he went to hell in  for running an opium den. “He hasn’t been reachable since.  “There are so many obstacles to cartwheel over when marrying a dead man.” Brocarde’s A-list guest list also includes King Henry the Eighth and Johnny Cash. Edwardo proposed to the singer in November , when she claims to have found a diamond ring on her pillow after the pair had a fight. She took the mysterious piece of jewellery as a romantic proposal and said aposyesapos to her spirit lover. She said: “One morning I awoke to find a ring on my pillow. It was digging into the side of my cheek – it felt like I’d been stung by a bee or something – but when I touched my face, I felt the stone and ring band. “I thought I was dreaming and I think I fell back asleep. When I awoke, the ring was gone. “I went for a shower and noticed a question mark appear in the steam. I was convinced I was still half-asleep, so grabbed a few espressos and carried on my day. “The next night the same thing happened, but this time I awoke to find the ring still there. Again, question marks appeared in the steam on the shower. “It was then that the penny dropped – Edwardo was proposing.”Despite the ghost being furious with her appearance on ITV ’s This Morning last year, she still wants him to feel like a king on their big day.After penning a love song to her beau on Halloween last year, which won back his affections, she has plans to kick it up a notch for their big day. She said: “I’ve really tried to pull out all the stops and I’ve written him a magical wedding song, which I plan to walk up the aisle to. “It’s always been my dream to write my own wedding anthem and the paranormal, haunting element of Edwardo’s presence has provided me with so much inspiration. “He’s really pushing me to the edge of creativity and challenges me to open my mind to a whole new world. For Valentine’s Day, the pair have some steamy plans ahead but Brocarde admits she will be the one left out of pocket. She added: “The thing that really annoys me, is that I will be left footing the bill but he is a cheap date, as he doesn’t eat or drink in public. “I’ve asked Edwardo to whisk me away for a steamy night of passion but he’s promised he’ll always be by my side wherever I travel. “I want to see what he has in store for me andI can really feel his presence.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Henry the eighthJohn DalliMarilyn MonroeWilliam ShakespeareThis MorningLoveMarriageSoldiersWeddingsWedding dayWedding dressJewellery\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was just in ridiculous pain and could barely move it without being in tears. I thought maybe I was just being dramatic but I just couldnapost take the pain and went to the doctor. I had countless appointments and was then diagnosed with chronic regional pain syndrome in December last year. Itaposs just basically turned my whole le upside down. Ms Hayes believe that few people realise or know about the crippling potential side effects of the implant, and claims that the only aftercare she was given after it was fitted was an information pamphlet. She added: I get a pulsating ache that runs down my whole arm to my wrist and back up to behind my earlobe. Itaposs like an electrical shock going up and down my arm and I get a numbness in my hand. It feels like the worst sunburn you can ever imagine - I canapost wear long sleeves because my arm feels like itaposs on fire. I have to push a shopping trolley with one hand and can never use a basket.  I have to have a big bag to carry washing around the house as I canapost hold it. I donapost go out drinking anymore, firstly because I canapost because of all the medication Iaposm on and secondly because Iaposm scared in case someone bumps into me. I just want to be a completely aposnormalapos -year-old as this has all been a nightmare. Ms Hayes said her treatment options were limited and instead has to use pain management techniques to cope. She has decided to speak out to raise awareness among other young people about the potential side effects of getting the contraceptive implant. Ms Hayes said I donapost want anyone  going through this. To be honest I donapost really think thereaposs enough research behind it. Iaposve tried to look more into it and find case studies but thereaposs not enough about it. I think they should just be offering the contraceptive patch and the pill - not things that go internally into your body. I just got told there might be bad cramps - not nerve damage. You can have this done from when youaposre , but I donapost want any -year-old to be in the same situation as me. I find it terrying this can be a side effect.

The Villages is a sprawling development for over-s in Central Florida, where residents sip cocktails with neighbours, live in homes with manicured lawns and travel to the market square on their golf carts. Happy music can be heard over the loudspeakers to promote positivity and to keep up this energy, ambulances reportedly turn off their sirens and funeral cars are said to be unmarked. It has its own newspaper and radio station, which is run by the communityaposs management, and only covers positive items. The manicured lawns have signs on them to warn residents to keep children and pets away as they are pumped with chemicals - to keep up its pristine appearance.  The Villages boasts  golf courses,  pools and , social clubs. But Americaaposs largest retirement community has caused controversy among residents who live in the same area outside the neighbourhood. It is understood , people - who are known as Villagers - live across the  villages, which is just an hour north of Orlando. The Schwartz family who developed the area are now billionaires.Valerie Blankenbyl, who spent time living in the community while shooting her documentary aposThe Bubbleapos told news.au : The Villages is a place that is so honed towards perfection that it cannot uphold that perfection, it’s just not possible. The Bubble was shown this week at Sydney Antenna film festival as Valerie likened the community to The Truman Show. The Truman Show stars actor Jim Carrey and is about a man who is trapped in a perfect town that turns out to be fake and made up of actors. Valerie also said most villagers will not hear anything negative against their community, which is promoted as an “active retirement community”. Daily programmes are packed with lunchtime karaoke, cardio drumming, belly dancing and cheerleading lessons, even synchronised golf cart displays. Valerie also says their days are filled with lots of day drinking.  In the documentary, one resident says to his we happy whatever day this is as he drinks a cocktail on his veranda. The filmmaker also said the residents she met were friendly. One is quoted in the film as saying: We know we’re in a bubble. But it’s a nice bubble”. However, outside the development, critics say there is something sinister about its idyllic appearance. As soon as you leave the development you can see local opposition, it is hard to escape.  Valerie said: It wasn’t something that you could escape because as soon as you drove outside the gates you see all these signs that say ‘Stop the Villages’. People who live nearby have raised concerns about their reported lack of accountability and apparent encroachment into established communities. Valerie said: You kept hearing inside The Villages that there was nothing before where The Villages now are. “But there wasn’t nothing. There was a community there and it was where people used to gather and now it’s just all gone.”  Campaigners against the community say the Villages use the mass amount of water to keep the grass lawns green and the pools filled, and claim the development has lowered the water table and led to shortages and sinkholes. One of the biggest thorns of all for the outsiders, is how the management company tries to separate it from its neighbours. Owners installed boom gates on roads going into the development, giving it the appearance of being gated. However, it is on public land and locals were fooled for years thinking they were barred from entering. Valerie also said the management tried to make her film crew leave and tried to stop residents from speaking to them. She added that many Villagers didnapost know about the controversy or werenapost bothered about le outside the bubble - and instead they were focusing on staying positive and cheery. Valerie says an academic who studies ageing told her it was one of the most troubling aspects of le in The Villages. She said: She thought The Villages was the most ageist place there is in the world. “Because even in a place that’s full of older people, you aren’t allowed to be old or age. “You still have to be fit and young and beautul and healthy. “And sickness, death and dying is not part of that. “It’s sort of like an extreme form of ageism that has manested in a retirement community.” The management company has been approached for comment.

The housemates were tipped off after a former tenant walking past the house told them there was “something in the roof” but they were not ready for the unsettling display they found.A video posted to TikTok shows the troubling scene what appears to be a stalker shrine covers one wall, with photos of a young man playing football, along with dusty clothes and gross ‘samples’ in plastic bags.Alongside the collection of faded photos pinned to the brickwork are dusty sports shoes and long football socks as well as zip lock bags containing used bandaids, cigarettes, hair and unknown liquids. Nearby is a hanger with a leather jacket and a pair of ripped jeans. Matt Martin, whose girlfriend lives in the house, said the housemates were shocked by the collection: “It was really really scary stuff,” he told news.au.“Everyone in the house was pretty much terried... There was some creepy stuff up there,” he added. The dusty photos and curled negatives are thought to date from the early s, they show a football player and another man. Matt said the tenants contacted their estate agent who asked the landlord about the creepy find. The landlord reportedly claimed they had been warned by builders doing renovations on the house before the group moved in that there was something up there. “They said don’t worry about moving it,” Mr Martin said. “I don’t think they’ve actually seen all the stuff.” After posting a video of the attic shrine on TikTok commenters told Matt he should contact the police. “We called the hotline and they pretty much just saidthere’s no body parts don’t worry about it,” he said. “I think one of us is going to have to do the dirty work and get it all down and throw it all out to make sure it’s all gone.” The landlords bought the four-bedroom terraced house in . The advertisement at the time said it was being offered for the first time in generations and had a circa s kitchen and family room.  In a follow-up video Matt said that the group were unsatisfied with the response from the police hotline and went to file a report in person at their local police station in Fitzroy, Melbourne.He said the cops there were fully supportive and took down a report. But Matt added: I doubt anything will come of it. Itaposs either a creep with a weird obsession with a footy player or an art installation.

The -year-old student currently makes an income through the buying and selling of medical skeletons, spines, and skulls. The product design student has more than  pieces in his morbid collection including a iety of human skulls and a wall filled with over  spines - and theyaposre all kept in his apartment.Although the nature of his trade does raise a few eyebrows, Jon claims his collection of bones is just for educational purposes, stating that he only works with medical bones which is what doctors and osteologists use for studying.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The majority of the bones acquired by Jon have reportedly been passed down from doctors or other medical professionals, and come from a time where people willingly donated them to science or their family did.Therefore, Jon explained, most of the bones in his collection have been passed down from older generations. At the time of writing, Jon has in his possession  full skeletons with all the parts plus more than  spines and  skulls that he keeps in a special showroom in his duplex apartment.  Jonaposs fascination with anatomy began when he was just  after his Dad, James Ferry - who works as a doctor - gted him the skeleton of a rat from a science fair as well as his very first human skull. He revealed: I began collecting animal skeletons too because I wanted to study them for science projects -My friend, who was a hunter for a gave me my first squirrel skeleton which I was fascinated by. So far, Jon has spent thousands of dollars on his unusual collection which he says he has sourced from inidual sellers unsure of what to do with skeletons that they donapost just want to throw away.Jon said: So many people donapost know the legality behind owning a medical skeleton - they feel uncomfortable but donapost want to just throw it away. Once I flew to Indiana and drove for six hours to collect a skeleton that these children were treating as a toy. He added: They only wanted to get rid of it because the new baby was terried of it and its ribs were shattered from being used as a play-thing. Jon has now come across a few situations where those who inherit skulls arenapost sure what the laws are so they choose to just bury it in their back garden, a move which can cause a scene years later when the police come. Although some believe his collection to be unethical, Jon would argue that his work is completely legal, while being a good way to improve anatomy education. Jon said: Itaposs quite a stigmatised trade - some people think that what I do is disgusting and atrocious however I rise above it and try to paint the field in a more educational manner. Iaposve had over , comments on social media that think itaposs illegal but people who donapost know laws have worst reactions. The avid collector went on to clary that he doesnapost work with grave or tribal skeletons which have been stolen from other countries, emphasising that everything I work with has been donated to science. He added: They then go onto universities, chiropractors and even apossearch and rescueapos agents to train snfer dogs to find missing people.

Walls, are normally a given, right !But one home thataposs gone up for sale in Norwich, Norfolk, has a rather unique feature in the master bedroom thataposs caused a stir amongst house hunters.Those that came across a three-bedroom home on Bishop Bridge Road were horried by the lack of privacy the main ensuite bathroom offers as it has glass walls.Looking at the images on Rightmove itaposs clear to see that both the bathroomaposs shower and toilet are on full display to the rest of the bedroom. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.The advert for the terraced house, which is perfectly unassuming from the outside, was uploaded to Rightmove a week ago and it could be yours for £,. Estate agents Sefftons listed the aposglass ensuiteapos as one of the key features that has been lovingly updated and reworked to a high specication and finish to bring wow after wow in the property. They explain that the unusual layout is designed to immerse you in the fantastic views, as the master suite overlooks the River Wensum at the rear of the home. But people online seemed rather unsure about having a room with a loo, with one even joking that it would give them loo anxiety. Sarah Weatherley, , said: I have been looking quite intensively on Rightmove recently because Iaposm looking to move to be with my partner. As my partner and I arenapost particularly tied to one area, Iaposve been comparing what you can get for the same money in ious areas. This house is on for about £, and is in Norwich. The house itself looks like itaposs in a stunning location with lovely views so I clicked on it. The ensuite was something of a surprise - I did a double-take and had to zoom in for another look. Iaposm not sure Iaposd want to live with that bathroom - and my partner was pretty weirded out by it too. The house is lovely but weaposd have to do something about those glass walls - maybe make the glass more opaque.  After spotting the listing, Sarah tweeted: Today on Rightmove: Impress horry guests with a glass-walled khazi. One user replied: Iaposm hoping against hope that itaposs the sort of glass that magically goes frosted at the flick of a switch. Another wrote: I still wouldnapost trust it. Like those aposautomaticapos locks on train toilets - gives me loo anxiety. Someone  said: Errrrr itaposs a NO from me!!! While a dferent user added: Had one of those in a hotel room in Berlin. Was weird even as the only occupant. Brr. The advert describes the three-storey property as an exceptional elevated period home with stunning river and cathedral views in the city centre of historic Norwich. The East Anglian city is said to have everything you would desire of a vibrant regional capital and has a real sense of history preserved and has been voted in the top ten happiest places to live in Britain. The house also boasts full height picture windows to the master suite, three reception rooms and an elevated riverside garden and al-fresco dining area. Meanwhile the ground floor features two reception rooms, a kitchen and a conservatory to the rear of the house, and on the first floor there are two double rooms and a bathroom. A spokesperson for Sefftons said: With so much attention and more than ten viewings booked within hours of launching to market, it seems everybody wants a loo with a view. Yes, you could frost the glass or screen the room, but where’s the fun in that. Designed for a fun loving couple who enjoy all the city has to offer, combined aposan exceptional view, in more ways than oneapos.

Elizabeth Kadlecik was born during the height of the pandemic in June  - but unknown to her parents, she had a rare genetic condition that caused her skin to severely harden. Known as harlequin ichthyosis, the skin grows too quickly, with cells multiplying so rapidly, it eventually hardens to a shell-like texture - which can become as thick as a turtleaposs at mm thick. Sadly, Elizabeth has also lost her eyelids as well as fingers and toes during her dficult start in le. The incredibly rare condition affects just just two in a million people - with Elizabeth believed to be the only person to suffer from it in her home country of Slovakia. Mum Natalia was told when she was  weeks’ pregnant that her baby was going to be born with both mental and physical disabilities. Doctors were unable to provide a diagnosis until birth, when Elizabeth entered the world six weeks premature - with doctors saying she would likely not survive. Natalia said: She came to this world in a thick and hard crust, like a turtle.  She was instantly rushed to intensive care as her skin around her face and chest was already hard and making dficult for her to breathe normally. The thick layer of skin had also constricted the natural growth of her body. But despite doctors telling parents Natalia and Martin that she wouldnapost survive, she survived after five weeks of sedation in intensive care. However, Elizabeth has suffered the lossher eyelids, two fingers and four toes to the condition - and is unable to regulate her body as she cannot sweat. Natalia added: The bandaging is quite painful and it has the tendency to bleed, because the skin on her palms is too tight. “In the future, plastic surgery will be needed.” “I know from other mums of kids with her condition that some people are mean and call their kids nasty names, but I don’t really know how I will react. I’m not sureI will cry or yell when this starts to happen. “I pray I will be prepared and I hope to stay strong for Elizabeth.

The eggs shows veins and a dark mass seen through the shell, resembling an alien-like form. The cluster of eastern brown snake eggs was gted to a snake catcher in New South Wales, Australia, say reports. Sean Cade, the owner of Australians Snake Catchers, became a surrogate mum to  perfect eggs last month after a snake laid them in his bag overnight. He says this event was rare and that they will hatch sometime in March. Sean has also joked that his friend is currently acting as a stand-in aunty. Speaking to news.au, Sean said: She has got the incubator.Sheaposs misting them. Snake eggs are leathery and soft, not rock hard like a bird egg, so they need moisture. He added that once the brown snakes lay their eggs in the wild they leave them, adding that  is the average number laid. Sean says that out of the  eggs laid, only about six looks like they are going to hatch.  He added: Six is good,I can save one of these eggs thataposs a good result in my book. He says when the snakes are born they will have to be ed to the wild because they will be just as venomous as their adult counterparts. Eastern brown snakes are considered Australiaaposs second most venomous land snake. They can grow to be about seven feet inand are found in Australia and southern New Guinea.  Eastern brown snakes prey of choice are mice. These deadly snakes are responsible for about  per cent of human snake-bite deaths in Australia. When they bite, its venom attacks the circulatory system and can cause haemorrhage, cardiovascular collapse and cardiac arrest.Last year, a pet cat died after fighting off an eastern brown snake to protect its owneraposs young children.

It comes after a -year-old pet store worker tested positive for Covid on January , leading to researchers collected swabs and blood samples from animals in the Hong King store and the warehouse supplying it.The study then found half of the Syrian hamsters in the pet shop had tested positive for the Delta iant. However, none of the dwarf hamsters, rabbits, Guinea pigs, chinchillas or mice tested positive. The research, which is yet to be peer reviewed, also determined that there had been at least two hamster to human cases of transmission - which had the potential to lead to onward human to human transmission.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

will be built west of Law Primary School and will replace the town’s current nursery on Law Road.However, Law Primary School’s parent council has raised concerns about the “lack of thinking around how families will travel to the nursery in a more sustainable and healthy way”.Construction is due to start next month, with the facility due to be completed by next year.The new building will feature a play area and garden to the north of the nursery, prompting criticism by parents of the building’s energy sustainability.Kate Allen, chairperson of Law Primary School Parent Council, said: “Our main frustrations have been the lack of thinking around how families will travel to the nursery in a more sustainable and healthy way, and how the nursery should be built to be as climate friendly as possible.”The parent council originally objected to the plans for the facility in May , citing two key points around creating better paths for travel and a reorientation of the building to utilise more natural light.New plans from East Lothian Councilwere released in December, with parents claiming that “very few changes to the original plans from May” had been made.The site of the new planned new early years centre at Law Primary School, North BerwickKate added: “We wrote to ELC in December asking for them to explain why this was and they never replied.“Then the plans were passed in January  without any further discussions.”Although a travel plan was not submitted in the nursery build’s original application, the council did meet with the parent council in May last year to discuss its concerns, and then submitted a comprehensive travel plan, which included many of the parents’ suggestions for future paths.The council has not, however, responded to parent council questions regarding the reorientation of the building.Kate said: “The latest report is completely unsatisfactory in terms of an explanation.“There may be a good reason but we are yet to hear one.“It was our belief that the buildings department would have to work with East Lothian Council’s Climate Change Strategy to ensure new building work should be as climate friendly as possible.“This is the question we believe needs asking of the council – are they using their Climate Change Strategy when they brief architects  If not, why not ”She added: “The delay to the build is so frustrating for staff and parents and we have only objected because we feel that these issues are so important – we want to get it right for future generations.”An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: “The project team has engaged with and responded comprehensively to the queries raised throughout this project both in discussions with Parent Council and Planning Department. This includes extensive information provided on the building’s energy and sustainability, which led to planning permission being granted.\"We have committed to providing a low carbon and sustainable nursery building in a - learning campus that supports the local community and provides a healthy and resilient natural environment for the future. This is in line with our Climate Change Strategy.“The development will offer learners, staff and the community all the benefits of moving from an older, much less energy-efficient building to a new, more sustainable, high-quality, purpose-built facility with multiple access routes to encourage sustainable travel.“The nursery building’s orientation within that campus of north  south is also very important. The main building access is orientated to the south from Old Haddington Road to allow ease of access for those with additional support needs, as well as addressing the close relationship to the main primary school building, of which the nursery is a part.“Energy efficiency has been considered carefully throughout the building’s design and specication and we aim to combine this with sustainable building practices and reduce emissions where possible throughout the construction.”The new nursery, which will have capacity for  children over two sessions, has an open-plan design, with a mezz- anine area and separate quiet room.The contract value of the nursery is £. million, with a further £, due to be spent on internal fittings.North of the site, a three-classroom extension for secondary-school pupils is being built on the south-west side of North Berwick High School.This £. million project, due to be completed next autumn, will house new home economics, modern languages and social studies classrooms for the high school."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-covid-update-today-time-watch","story":"Final restrictions put in place in response to the Omicron iant sweeping across Scotland have been removed since Monday, January .In last week’s update the First Minister has confirmed that following the cabinets three-week review, the current Covid measures will not change.Changes were however announced for international travel.

Lots of people empty the teapot contents once they are cool onto their houseplants.\"So, which leftover liquids will really make a dference  Here, experts unravel the fact from the fiction...Coffee\"We did some research and found tea and coffee are quite good for plants. They contain a modicum of nitrogen - butyou put milk in your drink it can get a bit smelly and rotten in the soil, although its alright for outside,\" says Barter.If you take sugar in your coffee, that may reduce the beneficial effects to your plants because it can lock up nitrogen, he warns. In that case, add ordinary fertiliserplants go a bit yellow. Try to avoid using coffee which has had milk or cream addedyoure going to deposit your dregs on houseplants.Putting coffee grounds into your compost heap is an organic way to give plants a huge boost, according to experts at WeThrt, who add that coffee grounds can also be used for most houseplants.But they warn against over-feeding plants with coffee, only giving them a boost about once a week. Acid-loving plants such as azaleas, hydrangeas and bromeliads prefer coffee to other plants like roses, which can end up with a burnt stemthey are overfed.Tea\"Tea is slightly acid, althoughyou have really alkaline water, that might reduce the acidity. People have historically used it on their indoor azaleas and gardenias and its thought to be good for houseplants,\" says Barter, although again try to avoid using milky tea.However, a Which  study in  found its unlikely that much of the nitrogen in tea is actually available to plants and that tea also contains aluminium, fluorine and manganese, which are harmless to people but high concentrations in very strong or stewed tea could stunt plant growth. It concluded that tea leaves are best put on the compost heap, rather than around your plants.BeerWhile most people tend to use beer to attract slugs into beer traps in the garden, some have taken to pouring it on their plants. The idea is that the acid in beer will kill pests, and the sugar and yeast will add beneficial soil microbes, assisting growth.However, there doesnt seem to be much substance to claims that it boosts the le of houseplants. \"I dont think it contains much nitrogen or plant food, so I wouldnt have thought its a good substitute for regular houseplant fertiliser,\" says Barter.Carbonated drinksFizzy drinks tend to contain sugar, which prevents plants from absorbing nutrients, so dont go pouring lemonade or cola on your houseplants.\"In the old days when lemonade was very sugary, it was excellent for putting cut flowers in because its acid, which stops the bacteria, and had sugar in it which would feed the stems. Im not sure modern lemonade would do that,\" adds Barter.Research shows that carbonated mineral water may be better, as it commonly contains many of the macronutrients hat are essential for healthy plant growth.According to a  study conducted at Colorado University Boulder, carbonated water makes plants grow faster and makes green plants grow greener.Carbonated water which has gone flat can also be used on houseplants, but make sure you dont pour it on your plants straight from the fridge, as this may send them into shock.Washing up liquid\"Using old washing up water to water your plants outside the back door shouldnt do any harm. There will be a certain amount of phosphorus in it, but it might be too grubby for indoor plants,\" Barter advises.At the end of the day...\"I cant think of anything thats a really good substitute for proper fertiliser,\" says Barter."},{"url":null,"title":"mary-continis-recipe-sauteed-cannellini-beans-winter-greens","story":"sautéed with new season extra virgin olive oil, fat juicy cloves of garlic and plenty of spicy chilli,according to your taste.Piled on some toasted sour dough bread this transports beans on toast to another stratosphere.Ingredients: x g tins cannellini beans or g dried teaspoons bicarbonate of soda garlic cloves fresh bay leaves dried chillies or  thick fleshed fresh chilliesextra virgin olive oil bunches bitter greens, cavolo nero or curly kaleSea saltpepperFlat leaf parsleyMethod:If using dried cannellini beans:Cover beans with cold water and leave overnight.Pre-heat oven Gas Mark    CDrain and rinse beans.Cover with cold water and add the bicarbonate of soda.Boil fiercely for  minutes skimming off all the scum that rises to the top.Rinse in cold water.Return to the pot, cover again with about - cm cold water.Add a crushed clove of garlic, unpeeled,  fresh bay leaves and a splash of extra virgin olive oil.Do not salt the beans at this stage.Bring to the boil, cover with a tight lid, and bake in the oven until cooked making sure they do notdry out.

There is a huge dference between an expat who decides to live abroad and the citizens of a part of the country that decides it wants to leave a union. Pensions are paid to us through the taxes collected from current taxpayers. There is no pot that can be shared between Scotland and rUK. Independence means just that – standing on your own two feet and living within your means. Those who seek independence sound like the flatmate who has moved out as they didn’t like you but still wants to come round to use the washing machine. The concept that another country would be responsible for paying pensions out of its current tax receipts is just farcical.As for goodwill on both sides, I have yet to see the SNP ever extend goodwill to the UK Government. Ian Blackford is testament to that. The ex-flatmate that is all nice when he wants something is going to learn the hard way.The SNP and separatists are yet again trying to get the citizens of Scotland to jump off a clf into the unknown. No thank you, I say.Jane Lax, Aberlour.THE BURDEN OF PROOFTHE joint contribution of The Herald and the Fraser of Allander Institute is to be welcomed in the debate on the future of Scottish pensions Letters, February   . We now have neutral confirmation that the UK state retirement pension scheme is a pay-as-you-go arrangement, with no accumulated personal or national pot and that it is a benefit rather than than an entitlement. In turn, we can now agree how those Scottish pensions will not be paid for .However, there is uncertainty as to how they would be paid for, even at the current rates, let alone the more generous levels promised by the SNP. It is incumbent on nationalists to tell us the who and how of the future funding of Scottish pensions. Hopefully, we will learn more in the much-touted independence prospectus now being prepared at great cost by the policy masterminds of the Scottish Government. Ever the optimist, I look forward to being convinced.Incidentally, the issue of pensions is a perfect example of why the burden of proof should always be with those who advocate change, in this case who support secession from the UK. We can see the current state retirement pension, how it is funded, how sustainable that funding is, what it will buy, what its relationship to private pensions is and so on. In contrast, we have no certainty at all about the arrangements in a putative independent Scotland, just lofty assurances and best-case scenarios, and there will none until we know how they will work in realistic and concrete terms.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.A DEAL WILL BE DONEMARK Smithquite rightly pointed out the irony in Ian Blackford and Nicola Sturgeon possibly \"doing a Boris\" regarding the state pension being paid by the UK Government on gaining independence. But his article seemed to be a personal worry that he may lose out financially given a breakaway. He needs to take on board that a Yes vote is not a vote for Nicola Sturgeon, or even a vote for the SNP, but a choice for self-determination. I believe that a deal will be done to honour the pension.Brian Higgins, Clydebank.* CAN someone please explain why the UK Government would continue to pay Scottish pensions after independence  I accept that the UK pays for expat Brits who live abroad as they are still British, but I cant see whyScotland gets independence why they would pay for the pension of foreign nationals, as every person living in Scotland will become a foreign national on day one of independence.Robert McCaskie, Biggar.GIVE US SOME CLARITYI AGREE with Barbara Jarvis . Last year one of George Galloways Alliance for Unitys policies was for the UK Government to pass a Canada-style Clarity Act to set out the terms of any referendum and subsequent treaty on issues such as national debt, trade, borders, citizenship and options for No-voting regions to remain in the UK.This would be negotiated before a referendum so voters would know what they were voting for.It was studiously ignored by all the mainstream parties. The argument over pensions is surely an example of the need for it,only to put the nationalist pipe dream – and Scotland – out of their misery.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.HOME TRUTHS FOR STURGEONKEVIN McKenna’s articlewas pretty funny and despite being tongue in cheek offered some serious points. I fully agree with his suggestion that the FM should visit “one of Glasgow’s less salubrious arrondissements” for a photo shoot.

I am afraid Boris Johnson must accept his part in igniting this disgraceful behaviour and unconditionally apologise. When he taunted the Opposition leader in the way he did, it was tantamount to unleashing every crank and zealot in the UK.Does the PM not recall that very recently one of his own MPs was brutally stabbed to death by a zealot  And of course no-one has forgotten the Jo Cox atrocity. When someone in high office uses such language he or she risks giving carte blanche to the unstable and deluded.It is incumbent on all in public office to speak in measured language and remember what can resultthey do not. Mr Johnson may well be singing \"I will survive\" in the shower but it will not be for much longer unless he learns very quickly to hold his tongue.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.THE CASE FOR A WINDFALL TAXOIL giant BP has reported its highest profit for eight years, amounting to £. billion for , the highest for eight years. This comes days after Shell reported profits of more than £ billion for last year, both companies cashing in on rocketing oil and gas markets.Gas prices have increased five-fold from prior to the pandemic and oil prices have almost doubled as economies open up. This is leading to big increases in gas and electricity bills for households, which will face a record energy bill increase of  per cent from April after the regulator lted the cap on default tarfs to £,. The choice for many, pushed into fuel poverty, will now be between heating and eating.Facing crippling increases in the cost of living, it is interesting to note what other countries are doing to tackle this energy crisis. France, for example, is capping bill increases at four per cent Norway is paying half of its citizen’s energy bills with profits from its lucrative oil fund, and Germany is looking to cap increases at five per cent.The pockets of the oil companies are deep, having profited from higher wholesale prices, and a one-off windfall tax here in the UK on fossil fuel giants helping hard-pressed households cope with record energy bills is urgently required.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.* WILLIE Macleanstates that when it comes to the treatment of North Sea oil, the crucial dference between Norway and Scotland is that the former is independent, whereas Scotland is not, being subject at the time to the UKs efforts to conceal the full potential economic benefits. The implication is, thatwe had been independent, then we could have followed Norways course.Forgive me for not sharing his rosy view, in light of the fact that with the benefit of  years hindsight, the SNP Government felt able to sell off seabed plots for offshore wind projects for what most experts deem to be a pittance.R Murray, Glasgow.Read more: Stop causing needless alarm to the elderly over pensions"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13456167.jpg?type=article-full","title":"first-look-inside-glasgows-burrell-collection-69m-revamp","story":"Along with his we, Constance, Lady Burrell, shipping magnate Sir William Burrell amassed one of the world’s greatest personal art collections.It was renowned for its quality of Chinese art, exquisite stained glass, intricate tapestries as well as its breadth of fine art.Read more: Glasgows Burrell Collection reveals public reopening dateAnd when Sir William decided he would donate his collection, Glasgow fought to give it a home in the city.Now, almost  years after the Burrell Collection opened its doors for the first time in the stunning grounds of Pollok Country Park, it is entering a new chapter in its history.

As a refuge, as for many people that’s what these places are, it is a place of hope because you can see that in the collections and the stories and it is a place of inspiration,\" she said.\"You just have to have met some of the children who have been helping shape some of the interpretation giving us ideas on what works and what doesn’t, we have had , local people involved in this.

However, while the case was sadly in this museum that not all local people felt that, we have done a lot of work in the past five years, with school groups in particular, now let anyone tell them this isn’t their collection.\"Funding for the £m project has come from several bodies including the UK and Scottish governments and how the citys treasures are funded in the future something which Dr McConnell believes could change.\"I think there is case for why we should fund museums like this in a time when the economy has been hit so hard as a result of Covid and so many people need new investment in social care and education, but this is as important. This speaks to what makes us all human.\"When we are planning for a society that nurtures people and let’s them reach their potential, you need places like this because it is so important about giving that place where you can reflect you can understand the rest of the world.

From the wartime parents who despaired of their s teenagers to Baby Boomers who wonder aloud about the behaviour of Millennials and Gen Z, dfering views and priorities will continue to ide the generations.  However, one thing that people of virtually every age can agree upon is that the direction of climate change is indisputable – andwe don’t accelerate our current attempts to tackle it then the consequences are going to be severe. Understanding the challenges is crucial.Those who will have to live longest with it are primarily Generations X, Y and Z – and their children, in what is now called Generation Alpha. These are people born between  and the mid-s. However, Baby Boomers also have a dog in this fight – for it is their grandchildren and great grandchildren who will live with the consequences of the actions we take in the next few years.And those actions must ramp-up drasticallywe are to have any chance of success. After the despair of the last few years of the pandemic it is now time for a ‘Great Acceleration’ of words and deeds.With that in mind, a number of Scottish organisations have come together to develop the Climate Solutions Acceleratorprogramme. The Royal Scottish Geographical Society, the Universities of Stirling and Edinburgh and online educational Jump Digital have created this new, world-leading project. Describing the thinking behind the concept, Mike Robinson, Chief Executive of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, said: “The curriculum as currently framed is wholly inadequate in covering the climate crisis, so it is not surprising that we are hearing from students themselves, wanting to learn more about the climate emergency. “Now and in the future, today’s young people will be driving much of the change required, so its vital we give them a solid foundation on which to build, as much in preparation for the world of work as for the protection of our planet.  The more we all understand the solutions, the sooner we can all start ensuring they happen.”The result of this collective endeavour is believed to be a world first a customised award which was created by Jump Digital and jointly badged with SQA who will certy successful candidates.It can be delivered to people of all ages and abilities in both the education and private sector fields.Derek Houston, Regional Manager at the Scottish Qualications Authority: “SQA is delighted to be one of the partners involved in the development of this unit, which will equip candidates with an understanding of the science behind climate change and of solutions that exist to help tackle environmental deterioration.”Jump Digital’s initial Schools Pilot Programme was road-tested by all S and S pupils and  members of staff at Lochside Academy, Aberdeen.  The feedback from Lochside has now been fine-tuned into the schools’ version of the CSA, which gives school pupils the environmental knowledge and skills that can improve their employability in what is, and will likely remain, a challenging jobs market. Neil Hendry, the former Head Teacher at Lochside Academy was enthusiastic about the impact of the course.He said:“Following a two-day induction programme for the key teachers and School Senior Management Team, our senior students completed the course on theirto school. It was very well received by staff and students, and I was subsequently very impressed by the willingness of Jump Digital to listen to – and make good use of – the feedback we provided.”Alongside the development of the core course materials, Jump Digital recognised the importance of ensuring that teachers and career advisers also have the necessary knowledge to guide students through the course and help them understand its value in the job market.Consequently, a Teachers Pack was produced, and ‘Meet the Expert’ webinars developed, where pupils and teachers can ask questions of industry thought-leaders. The next phase will see the Schools CS Accelerator being rolled out to over , pupils in the north-east of Scotlandas part of  Scottish Government’s £.million of funding to the North East Economic Recovery and Skills Fund.  In response to the successful trials and roll-out, Robert Fleeting of Jump Digital said: “Tackling the climate emergency is likely to shape the future careers of so many of our young people, so improving their understanding of the issue at an early stage is essential.”  Allison Carrington, Regional Skills Planning Lead at Skills Development Scotlandfor the north-east and working with partners to deliver the NEERSF, said: “It is satisfying to see so much progress being made with this innovative programme and the upcoming roll-out will now see up to , pupils across the north-east of Scotland benefit from its value and relevance in terms of developing employability skills.“SDS is supporting the ersication of the regional economy and the drive to net zero by delivering activity focusing on supporting a range of learners – including school pupils – to gain digital skills which will help them articulate into further learning or into employment in digital technology.”Newsquest Scotland commercial director David Ward said: “The Herald is proud to be involved with the Climate Solutions Acceleratorprogramme. It is vital that we not only equip Scotlands young people with an academic appreciation of the climate emergency, but also give them a real, practical understanding of the solutions that exist. The CSA course provides a one-stop solution which informs, inspires and motivates all who participate.”"},{"url":null,"title":"eve-muirhead-looking-add-olympic-gold-impressive-collection","story":"The Perthshire woman is something of a veteran of the curling scene, having made her international debut over a decade ago and picked up countless major victories along the way, including European Championship golds, the most recent only a few months ago, as well as world titles. There is, though, one prize still missing from Muirhead’s CV, and it is an omission she is hoping to put right over the next week-or-so. Despite having established herself as one of the best female curlers in the history of her sport, and having won almost everything there is to win, Muirhead does not have an Olympic gold medal to her name. Back in , as a -year-old, she won Olympic bronze in Sochi but having beaten the very best of the best in her sport over the years, she knows she has what it takes to grab that elusive gold medal in Beijing this week and it is a gap in her record that she would love to fill. “I do think about what I still want to achieve and an Olympic gold is one medal I am missing. It is something I want to be in a position to fight for and, in Beijing, I’m in that position so that’s all I can ask for,” she says. “I know I’ve got a team behind me who are as dedicated and as talented as me and so it’s exciting being at the Olympics in a position to perform to our best.  “I really do believe that whatever happens, we’ve put in everything we can to try for that gold.” Muirhead’s build-up to the Beijing Games, which will be her fourth Olympic appearance, has been in marked contrast to that of her previous three. This time, the women’s squad operated on a rotation system, with team members switching in and out with each competition while failure to qualy automatically for Beijing earlier in the season saw them forced to fight it out for the final few available places in Beijing in the do-or-die Olympic qualier last December. The class of Muirhead, plus her teammates of Vicki Wright, Jen Dodds and Hailey Duff, ultimately shone through, winning that Olympic qualication event and while the past year has been unlike anything she has ever experienced, Muirhead believes she heads into these Games a stronger athlete because of it. “It’s been such a tough road to get to Beijing so just being here and having GB on our backs feels so rewarding and shows the hard work that the team’s put in has paid off,” Muirhead says. “I never want to experience the pressure of the qualiers again but actually, I think that’s been really helpful going into the Games because that event was very intense and it was competition that some of the other teams didn’t get. It gave us another chance to play under real pressure before the Olympics. “And with the rotation system, I’ve had to fight for my spot in the team just the same as everyone  this season and I was nervous as any of the other girls about making it.  “You don’t know how the others are going to do so every day you have to just focus on performing to the best of your own ability and also show that you’re the best team player because, at the end of the day, it’s a team sport.  So I think this has been a unique season for me, just like it has for the others, and that’s been a good thing.” Muirhead may be a veteran of the Olympic scene but the same cannot be said of her teammates.  Muirhead is the only GB curler, male or female, in Beijing who has any previous Olympic experience and so it is inevitable she will be relied upon for guidance and leadership when they begin their campaign in the early hours of tomorrow morning. Having long been not only skip of her rink but also the most recognised face in her sport in this country, Muirhead is no stranger to such a role and so while she is comfortable showing her teammates the ropes where need be, she is also confident they will manage just fine by themselves on the biggest stage of all. “The Olympics is something dferent from everything  you could ever compete in. You could play every single other event on the tour and it’s not the same as the Olympic Games it’s an event that you just can’t buy that experience in terms of being a part of Team GB,” she says. “Having said that though, I really believe the team is ready for this and we know what’s ahead of us “They’ll, I’m sure, have a lot of nerves and a lot of excitement but that’s the same for me too. “Even though I’ve been to a few Olympic Games, you still get the nerves, it’s not like this becomes second nature so we’ll all be dealing with those feelings. We’ll be ready though.” "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13457933.jpg?type=article-full","title":"fly-australia-glasgow-airport-borders-reopen","story":"Since Covid- first started to affect us back in March , Australia introduced a strict entry policy for visitors.Exemptions were only in place for Australian citizens, permanent residents and immediate family members of Australian citizens or permanent residents.But finally, Australia will open up its borders again to vaccinated tourists and other visa holders from February , .\" alt\"HeraldScotland: \" class\"editor-image\" Unvaccinated visa holders will still need a valid travel exemption to enter Australia.Skyscanner is a great tool to source flight options.

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole.

They need to go into the games and they need to do their best.“After, in the end, we will see what happens, butI saw after the games the team has the personality to have the ball or when we don’t have the ball, we fight for it and we continue to be strong and compact, good things will come to us.“Look, I really haven’t changed anything in my behaviour. I don’t want anyone to feel relaxed, I want everyone feeling the same way. We have a lot of things to do until the end of the season.”Wolves have won four of their last five league games but will run out against the Gunners on the back of a disappointing - FA Cup fourth round defeat by Norwich.However Lage, who will welcome back Romain Saiss from Africa Cup of Nations duty, Trincao from Covid- and will make late checks on Hwang Hee-chan and long-term absentee Jonny, is not content for his side to rest on their laurels.He said: “What the team did in December and January gives us that ambition to look up, so that’s what I want, to have my team have character, my players have character, that we have good things to conquer in the last three months.“It’s an important period for us and what I want is to be ready and to take every time the best decisions in every game.“We’ll go into tomorrow with, I believe, the ambition and the character we should have to play like we have played in the last months.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The charity has recently issued an emergency appeal for donations. vw,vw,px, px\"Katie Piper attending the National Television Awards  “We lost a quarter of our income in lockdown because a lot of our fundraising events were face-to-face – sporting events, dinners, big crowds, so we’ve been unable to do this in the last  months,” Piper said.“But actually the demand on our services increased – people self-harming through burns, historical burn injuries where the psychological journey had gone backwards in confidence in lockdown and in isolation, and people who were in accidents and traumas prior to the lockdown and woke up from comas in the middle of the world suddenly changing.”Piper said the charity has set up a survivors’ support line which links burns patients on units where staff have been re-deployed amid the Covid effort to physiotherapists and psychologists.In , Piper gave up her right to anonymity and made a Channel  documentary called Katie: My Beautul Face.The activist has undergone more than  operations over the past decade, and she now hosts a podcast, Katie Piper’s Extraordinary People, where she chats with inspirational people who have turned adversity into positivity.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first.

Picture date: Thursday, November , .Niamh CampbellTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailWith Sir Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast receiving seven Oscar nominations, it’s doubtful the film will win a clean sweep. However, local industry experts are hoping Belfast-born Ciaran Hinds takes home his nod for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.“We would all like to see Ciaran Hinds get something, not just for the film, but because he#s such a decent bloke and a brilliant actor,” said Hugh Odling-Smee, a writer and theatre producer from Belfast.

I organised a talk he gave at my Uni when I was there. He refused to let us pay for his travel or book him into a nice hotel,” posted the creator of BBC Three comedy, My Left Nut.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He said that the star of HBO’s acclaimed TV series Rome had instead said: “Just get me a spare room in your halls of residence, that#ll do me.”“He was honestly the kindest and nicest man to everyone there,” Patrick added.“Bumped into him a few times since and he#s always remembered me, gave me a bit of advice after leaving drama school and all - couldn#t say anything better about him. And he#s an absolutely phenomenal actor.”Ciarán Hinds: Oscar Nominee.I organized a talk he gave at my Uni when I was there. He refused to let us pay for his travel or book him into a nice hotel.\"Just get me a spare room in your halls of residence, that#ll do me\"Star of HBO#s Rome just chilling in our halls.— Michael PatrickFebruary , Mr Odling-Smee believes Belfast is up against some stf competition in its other categories. He feels The Power of the Dog’s Jane Campion could pip Branagh for Best Director and that Kirsten Dunst could edge out Judi Dench as Best Supporting Actress.However, he says Belfast is a strong frontrunner for Best Picture, and even though the bookies have it second to The Power of the Dog for that prize, acknowledged that “the Oscars can be full of surprises”.“A film can just land at exactly the right time, and I think Belfast is one of them. I think that we’ve all been through so much over the last two or three years,” he said.“This is a genuine escapist film in the sense that you’re skipping into another world in the past, obviously, but it’s recognisable for people as well. It’s a fairly straightforward story of a family who find themselves in a very dficult situation and have to make a big choice about where they live and who they are.“I think that#s what people engage with. Belfast is important as a backdrop, but I think it’s that sense of escapism. The film is shot with a sense of escape - going to the cinema, in a dark place with a lot of other people - Belfast has recaptured that sense of going to see a film in the proper way. There are lots of bits where Buddy [played by Jude Hill] and his family go to see films. It was a black and white world but when they went to the cinema, it was in colour.”Mr Odling-Smee also believes that while some critics have accused the movie of not delving into the details of the Troubles in the same way it does the setting of the film, this is the probable reason for its huge popularity.He added: “I think what people miss to a certain extent is that it’s from a child’s view of what is happening. Buddy is trying to work out the world he’s going into. If we all remember back to the Troubles, we didn#t necessarily understand all the things that were happening around us when we were aged  or .“We understood the basics, we understood that maybe there were two tribes, but we didn#t understand all the nuances and the roots of it. As adults, we barely understand it. I think Branagh captures that pretty well.”Most Read‘Keep calm and carry on as Northern Ireland Protocol is here to stay’… investment expert says businesses do not agree with DUPPolice launch murder investigation after mandies following Lisburn ‘assault’ under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs who don’t let fear hold them backLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’South Belfast restaurant damaged after car driven into front and set alightTop VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominations\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Man shot in legs during Newry shootingPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Latest Northern IrelandPolitical agreement needed to unlock economic potential of Maze site, MLAs toldSoldier F named in Irish ParliamentCoronavirus Northern Ireland: What restrictions could be lted tomorrow Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageMan found dead in  ‘likely to have been drowned by others’, coroner findsLatestIan Stewart to spend rest of le in prison after murders of we then fianceeWildle licences restricted on Highlands estate where eagle was found deadLionel Richie says his blackness was ‘questioned’ during early careerITV confirmsdate for Ant  Dec’s Saturday Night TakeawayKim Kardashian: I’ve chosen myself, I think it’s OK to choose you,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The accused is further alleged to have assaulted two people and allegedly made a threat to damage windows at an address at Drummond Court.The charges relate to October , . The defendant has been in custody since October after being unable to make bail.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up She appeared at court via a video link from prison.A defence lawyer said the case allegedly involved “waving an imitation firearm at a neighbour in a street and then there is a small amount of cannabis growing in her house”.That case was adjourned to February .Regarding the defendant’s dog and  fish the defence lawyer said a Council had made an application for a “Disposal Order”.He said the defendant “does not consent” to the Order.District Judge Nigel Broderick asked who was looking after the dog and  fish while the defendant is in custody and the defence lawyer said: “I believe it is the Council”.A legal representative for a local Council told the court to date it had cost around £, to look after the animals — £ for the dog and £ for the fish per day.The judge asked: “What sort of fish are we talking about ”The Council lawyer said she was not sure.Judge Broderick said: “I hope it is not goldfish”.The Council lawyer said the fish were in a “filtered tank” and added: “I don’t think they’re goldfish.”The judge added: “It costs £ a day to look after  fish in a tank of water. I find that very hard to understand”.The judge said it was a “struggle” for him to understand the cost, adding: “The dog yes but the fish, really  It seems exorbitant to me but that is just my preliminary view.”The judge wanted to know on what basis the council was making the application and askedthere had been a conviction regarding the animals.The council lawyer said: “No, there hasn’t been a conviction or a decision on prosecution in the matter yet. The Council were contacted by police on the date of Ms Martin’s arrest and advised that animals were in the property.“Once they had ensured that the property was not being accessed by anyone  and the animals not being looked after the animals were therefore seized.“Given that Ms Martin has remained in custody since October we haven’t had any approach from anyone willing to assist in the care of the animals so the Council has had to remain their custodian.”The court heard the dispute about the application will have to be fixed for a hearing.The council lawyer said a council officer and a vet would give evidence.That case was adjourned to March .Most Read‘Keep calm and carry on as Northern Ireland Protocol is here to stay’… investment expert says businesses do not agree with DUPPolice launch murder investigation after mandies following Lisburn ‘assault’ under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs who don’t let fear hold them backLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’South Belfast restaurant damaged after car driven into front and set alightTop VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominations\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Man shot in legs during Newry shootingPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Latest Northern IrelandPolitical agreement needed to unlock economic potential of Maze site, MLAs toldSoldier F named in Irish ParliamentCoronavirus Northern Ireland: What restrictions could be lted tomorrow Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageMan found dead in  ‘likely to have been drowned by others’, coroner findsLatestLionel Richie says his blackness was ‘questioned’ during early careerITV confirmsdate for Ant  Dec’s Saturday Night TakeawayKim Kardashian: I’ve chosen myself, I think it’s OK to choose youPolitical agreement needed to unlock economic potential of Maze site, MLAs toldSpaceX satellites falling out of orbit after solar storm,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And while this semi-autobiographical film is about the Troubles and the effect it had on the people who lived here, it#s also about how le went on regardless and people tried to make the best of things - going to school, visiting grandparents, worrying about brown envelopes - in one of the most authentic aspects of the film.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The telling of the story through the eyes of Buddy, an innocent child, adds crucial objectivity and a view of things through the eyes of someone without the cynicism of adults or the need to weigh up the options like his parents. Instead, he#s more worried about his fondness for his classmate and how whatever turn his le takes may affect her and their relationship.Buddy#s grandfather, played by the inimitable Ciaran Hinds, listens to him talk about his crush and schools him on the topic of love while Pa, played by Jamie Dornan, has to listen to a local heavyweight who threatens the family#s safety. later, Buddy worries thatthe family moves away, his accent won#t be understood. He is assured: If they can#t understand you, then they#re not listening.It#s a wider point, made to ying degrees throughout the film, about how best to relate to each other and while not the whole picture, plays into the broad brush subjectivity that means Belfast can be enjoyed by all.Read MoreBelfast: Branagh’s ode to city goes up against western hit The Power Of The Dog at the OscarsWill it be seventh heaven for Branagh this time at Oscars Most Read‘Keep calm and carry on as Northern Ireland Protocol is here to stay’… investment expert says businesses do not agree with DUPPolice launch murder investigation after mandies following Lisburn ‘assault’ under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs who don’t let fear hold them backLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’South Belfast restaurant damaged after car driven into front and set alightTop VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominations\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eae .ece AUTOCROP wh fbfedcdcbdaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Man shot in legs during Newry shootingPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Latest Northern IrelandPolitical agreement needed to unlock economic potential of Maze site, MLAs toldSoldier F named in Irish ParliamentCoronavirus Northern Ireland: What restrictions could be lted tomorrow Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageMan found dead in  ‘likely to have been drowned by others’, coroner findsLatestNo extra money for Scotland from council tax rebate – Holyrood ministerIan Stewart to spend rest of le in prison after murders of we then fianceeWildle licences restricted on Highlands estate where eagle was found deadLionel Richie says his blackness was ‘questioned’ during early careerITV confirmsdate for Ant  Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task. It will be consulted on any designations or proposals by government or local government relating to the area, including the marine nature reserve..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Gibney’s Hoops double  ","story":"IT was a case of what could have been for Killough, as Celtic Bhoys capitalised on opportunities to stay in the race for the title on Saturday.From the refereersquos first whistle it was a heated event at Ballyhornan with both sides looking to grab possession.The advantage of the wind was with Celtic Bhoys in the first half, and it was a minor error by Killough goalkeeper, James Crangle, in the fourth minute that gted Jay Gibney his first goal of the game.Cranglersquos kick out went direct to the striker and Gibney made no mistake with his finish.The Killough players looked more driven by this and showed great character supporting their goalkeeper to get his head back into the game. Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help.

Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

The tactic looked like paying off, but at the post So Ladylike, with Caoimhe OrsquoBrien in the saddle, got up to provide the rider with her second success, her first coming on this Alana McGuinness-owned runner back in October. Ballinasilla finished a close third.The winner is trained by Ian Donoghue, a brother of top Northern Ireland jockey Keith, who is no longer with Gordon Elliott.Only six of the  entries took part in the Dennison JCB Maiden Race for five year-old geldings, but the race provided spectators with a close finish.The Aaron Sinnott-ridden Song For My Father, owned and trained in Co Cavan by Shane Donohoe, just passed the judge ahead of Time For A Pint, ridden by Tom Hamilton for Co Carlow trainer Shark Hanlon, with Hapy La Vie back in third ahead of Old Style Humor.It was not long before a stewardsrsquo enquiry was called with the result that the winner was disqualied for failing to draw the correct weight. Time For A Pint was placed first ahead of Hapy La Vie and Old Style Humor .Four set out in the Kingsfield Stud five year-old Mares Maiden Race, but only three remained after the fourth fence, after Paddy Cleary lost his irons and was unseated.This left Born Famous to win from Famous Function and local hope Social Distancing. For trainer Claire OrsquoConnell it was a welcome winner. Paul Bannon was the successful rider.The Cosy Roof Open Race saw the grey Creadan Grae make most of the running but in the end had to be content with second to the ex-English trained Brain Power mdash a rare open horse for Warren Ewing, who is best known for producing top four year-olds.The successful rider was Maghera-based Oran McGill who was replacing his injured younger brother Dara. Warren is part of the well known fish merchant family. Third home was Bajan Excell, ridden by Ben OrsquoBrien.The connections of the runner-up in this race, Broughshane owner Philip McBurney, rider Noel McParlan and trainer Gerry Quinn, also based at Broughshane, had better fortune in the Armstrong Auctions  year-old and Upwards Mares Maiden when Tamlaght Eyes, pulled up in her previous three races, proved to be the smooth winner from the Lee Shawagen-ridden Any Time with Castle Arms Casa a very close third.The final race on the card was the G Curran  Co Ltd Maiden Race for  year-old and Upwards Geldings. Ask Charlie was the easy winner from Kilmoganny, ridden by Tiernan Power-Roche, and Robbie Armstrongrsquos ex-English trained Carolersquos Templer, ridden by Deckie Lavery.Good to see the long established Denis Reddan colours in the winning enclosure. Ridden by Ben Harvey, the winner is trained by his father, William.Perhaps the result may have been dferent had Paul Bannon not become unseated at the final fence of his mount Butcher Barry.Best turned out in all races as usual was courtesy of Glencairn Stables.Acting stewards: Rev Colin Hall-Thompson, Max and Margaret Evine and David Aiken.Ballee jockey Toni Quail, out of action with a broken ankle as a result of a schooling accident, was helping with declarations at the meeting.A tribute was paid to the late Maurice King who for many years was a vet at the meeting.The next meeting at Tyrella is on Saturday, March . Prior to that, the North Down meeting at Kirkistown will take place on February . First race is at pm. The same evening the East Down Hunt Ball will take place at Ballydugan Mill.Victor Reid, a long time owner and breeder along with his late we Margaret, sadly passed away suddenly at hospital on Friday. His son, Neville, still has horses in training. The late Drew Reid also from Banbridge, rode many of Victorrsquos horses in point-to-points.A notable absentee at the entrance on Saturday was William McDowell, although he was present.

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I strongly recommend that the author of the editorial reads the -page Amnesty report. It was developed through four years of rigorous and extensive research on laws, policies and practices, where we have documented in detail how Israeli authorities treat Palestinians as an inferior racial group and systematically deprive them of their rights.It documents how massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, the forcible transfer of Palestinian people from their land, drastic restrictions on movement, and the denial of nationality and citizenship to Palestinians are all components of a system amounting to apartheid.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Apartheid is defined under international law. No two systems of oppression and domination will ever be identical, and the treatment does not need to be identical to that experienced historically in South Africa. Indeed, Amnesty has previously found that the Myanmar government subjects the Rohingya people to a system of apartheid. Apartheid is both an international wrong and a crime against humanity. When a crime against humanity is committed, the international community has an obligation to hold the perpetrators to account.Crucially, Israeli law treats Palestinians as an inferior and separate group defined by their racialised non-Jewish, Arab status.We conclude that this apartheid system is enforced against all Palestinians living under the effective control of Israel – whether in Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, or in other countries as refugees.Amnesty recognises that Jewish people, like Palestinians, claim a right to self-determination and does not challenge Israel’s desire to be a home for Jewish people. However, international law does prohibit Israel from discriminating against Palestinians and others who already live in that country, including with respect to rights concerning family reunication, and against Palestinian refugees who have a right toto the country.Like all countries, Israel has the right - and indeed an obligation under international law - to protect all people under its control. However, security-related policies must still comply with international law, and they must be proportionate to the threat posed. Security can never be a justication or pretext for human rights violations and crimes against humanity. Though not the subject of this report, Amnesty has consistently documented serious violations by the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and Gaza. We have consistently reported on and condemned unlawful attacks by Palestinian armed groups against Israeli civilians. This includes the firing of indiscriminate rockets from Gaza into Israel, which we have called for the International Criminal Court to investigate as war crimes. The state of Israel has been a member of the United Nations since its establishment in . It is a party to international human rights conventions and other treaties and therefore must respect these obligations, including by upholding the right to equality and non-discrimination, and by ending and remedying violations of international law. This report is a call for the Israeli government to do so and thus end its system of apartheid against Palestinians.Patrick Corrigan, Northern Ireland Programme Director, Amnesty International UKAmnesty International calling Israel an apartheid state is an unjust slur——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

After waiting for three golfers to complete the hole they moved on locating their first stile in woodland which led into fields containing sheep as the sun put in an appearance.A descent led them to the ruined buildings and old stable block at Cefncarnau-fawr along with a mysterious ivy clad ruined building, where they deviated along a narrow muddy track in woodland to enter fields, where boots crunched over frozen uneven mud as they approached a stile leading into Coed-y-wenallt.A wide wet and muddy pathway populated with dog walkers led them to a wooden footbridge and across the fast flowing Nant Cwm Nofydd for the climb up to Rhiwbina Hill and a short road walk before turning into Fforestganol.A steep climb past water gushing down the bare hillside in small waterfalls led them through Heol y Forest and along a rough track carpeted with autumnal leaves with shadows of the surrounding bare trees silhouetted on the ground. Then downhill through part of Fforest-fawr where natural resources like limestone, coal and haematite, an iron rich mineral which were abundant in this area were mined. So many of the hollows and mounds to be found within the woodland are the result of shallow workings and spoil tips, many of which are now hidden beneath vegetation.The path eventually brought them out at the bottom of the main driveway leading uphill to Castell Coch, or the red castle and stopping to utilise fallen tree trunks for seating, they enjoyed morning refreshments whilst gazing at the fairy tale castle. Actually built on the remains of a th century castle this th century Gothic style folly, standing above the steep Taff gorge was built by William Burgess for the rd Marquis of Bute, although sadly Burgess died ten years before the project was complete..removeRefreshed, another climb led them uphill and further into Fforest-fawr where they descended a wide pathway to the valley bottom to join part of the Taff Trail along the flat disused railway line. Then another climb, this time on narrow muddy pathways through bracken to zig zag gradually uphill to the open hillside overlooking Taffs Well and Gwaelod y Garth in the valley below and up through the Taff valley towards Rhydfelin and Pontypridd.The last haul brought them to the summit of Craig yr Allt with its panoramic views including towards its sister hill the Garth and the reward of a sit down for lunch under overcast skies, whilst gazing towards the coast at Penarth Head and out across the misty Bristol Channel. Continuing along the ridge and making their descent to a road, a short journey led them back into fields containing passive horses as they trekked through mud to Waun-waelod.One last climb up through a waterlogged narrow track between bramble bushes led them out onto Caerphilly Common as the sun ed, for the short climb to the trig point at m on Caerphilly Mountain to enjoy the views over Caerphilly in the valley below with its ruined castle clearly visible.All that was left was the short descent passing many other people who were out with dogs and children enjoying the afternoon sunshine and views, to make their way back to their start point after a lovely . mile undulating tramp.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were lots of discussions about how they view the UK and our mutual partnerships going forward, how we tackle global challenges, and how we fight for human rights and gender justice together.After arriving back in the early hours, I was then straight back into Westminster for anFriday sitting in Parliament – a very important one – as I joined other MPs to support my colleague Rosie Cooper MP’s British Sign Language Bill, which aims to make BSL an official language of the UK.I had a chance to thank local BSL interpreters and deaf community activists, saying: “I add my wholehearted support to this Bill. Like many hon.

Picture: PA The Six Nations Championship comes around once a year seeing international sides of France, England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales each going head-to-head.Every team will play each of the other teams once throughout the competition adding up to a total of  matches.Home advantage alternates each season so, for example,England played Scotland at home last year, they will be away this year.The Championship generally commences in February, coming to a conclusion at the end of March.: Six Nations referees  - meet the refs assigned to every gameTeams are awarded bonus points for scoring four or more tries in a game. Picture: PA The winning team will be awarded four points. Any winning team scoring four tries or more in any game, an additional bonus point will be awarded.The losing side gets no points but can achieve bonus match points. If a team scores four tries or more or loses by a margin of seven points or fewer they will be awarded one point. If the losing side scores four tries or more and loses by a margin of seven points or fewer, they will be awarded two points.Unions that draw a Match shall each be awarded two Match Points and any of them that scores four tries or more in the process shall be awarded a further one Match Point.For a draw, two match points will be awarded to each side, howevereither team scores four tries or more during the game, they will achieve a further one bonus point.More points are up for grabs for any team winning all five of its games. Known as a “Grand Slam” the team will be awarded a further three bonus points..removeSix Nations: The TableIn the event of a draw, points scored and conceeded and number of tries comes into play. Picture: PA Quite obviously the team with the most points will be top of the table with other teams appearing in descending order according to their total points.At the end of the Championship,two or more teams finish with the same number of points, they will be placed according to the total points scored and the total points conceded in all games.If after that two or more teams still hold the same position, they will be placed according to the number of triesscored by each team across all five games.If after that there are still teams holding the same position, they will be placed equally.Six Nations Trophies Guinness Six Nations Championship Trophy.

However, Mr Swann said he was not prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lting now unnecessary restrictions. I am now seeking that legal guidance on how I myself can replace the bulk of the remaining restrictions,not all of them, with clear guidance and advice, he said on Monday afternoon. When we had an executive, ministers always said we wouldnt retain restrictions for a day longer than necessary, so that same logic should still apply. While we must move forward carefully, we cant stay locked in emergency restrictions forever. We need to start getting normal back.
