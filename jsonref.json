They may have stopped recruiting patients because the risk of Covid-19 infection in hospitals was too high.Some 10 per cent - 1,500 - were shut down all together.It is unclear currently the exact reasons why each was stopped, but possible reasons include the research being time sensitive or they did not have enough money to wait until after the outbreak, for example.  Dr Head told MailOnline: \u0027I guess looking back and reflecting, the numbers are not surprising. The pandemic has taken the world by surprise. \u0027We\u0027ve shown globally and in the UK we are not prepared, and that will impact on research. \u0027Research is directed towards Covid-19, which is necessary. But obviously that will impact on other areas of health. In terms of preparedness for the future, we need to make sure non-Covid types of research are in planning.\u0027The research is ongoing and so it is unclear exactly what areas have been impacted the most. This will become clearer over the next few months.Dr Head said: \u0027It might be that cancer research was not affected but stroke and mental health was. It won\u0027t just be large diseases, but areas of health with few cases.\u0027There will be research impacted that what will be rare or orphan diseases, where there isn\u0027t much treatment available. \u0027Aspects of that might include motor neurone disease or haemophilia. If they are impacted it might hard for those charities to carry on.\u0027He added that it will be important to discover what knowledge would have been found had Covid-19 not halted medical research.These \u0027knowledge gaps\u0027 will be important for moving forward in the treatment of patients, he said.Dr Head told The Observer: \u0027This pandemic has knocked everything off track. Research gives us the knowledge we need to tackle illnesses in new ways, and if that doesn\u0027t happen all areas of health will suffer.\u0027 A stark example of the harm caused to medical research by the pandemic is to cancer research, as large charities have revealed the devastation in stark numbers.  \u0027We had planned to spend £400m on research this year. That figure will have to be cut to £250m,\u0027 Aoife Regan of Cancer Research UK told the Observer.\u0027That is £150m of research on treatments with the potential to save or lengthen lives that will not now take place.\u0027If cuts continue to persist for four or five more years, it would mean hundreds of millions of pounds will be stripped from cancer research in the UK in coming years which will \u0027send ripples beyond that\u0027. The impact of Covid-19 on cancer patients has been at the forefront of discussions during the pandemic. Dame Laura Lee, the chief executive of cancer charity Maggie\u0027s, today said the past few months have been a difficult time for cancer patients.Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, she said: \u0027It\u0027s been hugely difficult. Cancer is not just a physical illness but it\u0027s the psychological effects that has not just on the person but also the family.\u0027With auto treatments and on many occasions treatment being ceased, people with cancer dying during this period, or finding that their disease has progressed, it\u0027s been a heightened time of distress and anxiety.\u0027Cancer always brings anxiety, a sense of aloneness, but during this Covid time, it\u0027s been higher than ever. \u0027People are coming into our centres with that knowledge and information of what they\u0027ve heard and worrying, what does that mean for me?\u0027Our centre staff have never said they\u0027ve ever dealt with such level of distress, feelings of anger, about the situation they find themselves in and actually, to a certain extent, feelings of abandonment with the NHS as well.\u0027 Shannon Amoils, of the British Heart Foundation, said its research had \u0027ground to a halt\u0027 during the pandemic. A study at Edinburgh University was set to determine if specific drugs could prevent stroke patients from going on to develop vascular dementia. Another study at Newcastle University aimed to find out if non-invasive treatments could be used instead of surgical interventions for elderly men and women who had suffered heart attacks. Brian Dickie, of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, warned time was critical for the research of motor neuron diseases - which affect about 5,000 people in the UK.He said: \u0027Around 50 per cent of people with motor neurone disease will die within 18 months of their first diagnosis.\u0027Work to determine whether a drug called Tudca could stop the disease progressing is among the suspended trials.Dr Dickie said: \u0027These iniduals are rapidly running out of time, so suspending projects like these is utterly heartbreaking.\u0027    The British Lung Foundation said in May it had had to pause a phase two clinical trial for new drugs to treat malignant pleural mesothelioma.The condition has no cure and just five per cent of men and 10 per cent of women survive for more than five years.Dr Samantha Walker, the director of research and innovation at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, told The Telegraph: \u0027This is not good news for a cancer where survival rates are dismal and there is no cure.\u0027We completely understand the need to focus on Covid-19 right now, but the impact will be colossal, with huge repercussions on the research community and patients who, heartbreakingly, don\u0027t have time to spare. This will mean delays in the trial going ahead and any potential new treatments reaching those who need them.\u0027Michael Lauer, deputy director for extramural research at the US National Institutes of Health, said the effect of Covid-19 on medical research goes beyond just trials.In a article for The Lancet last week, he said: \u0027There have also been tremendous disruptive effects on all biomedical research that is not directly related to Covid.\u0027Laboratories are closed. Communications have been shut down, conferences have been cancelled, supply chains for equipment have been lost, resources have been lost. There have been widespread financial losses within academic medical centres that have had spillover effects on their research operations.\u0027        Thousands of clinical trials halted amid focus on finding coronavirus treatments"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8829c9aaceee8d7d6c89ad59f8993f368775fa8f/0_198_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d12c27d0ee1dbfff0a5410a1215374c8","title":"the big picture a tender family moment with jfk","story":"A candid shot of the young senator by Life magazine’s Ed Clark portrayed him as a man to lead a new generation into a new decadeEd Clark, a Life magazine staff photographer, was commissioned to photograph the Kennedy family at home in Georgetown in 1958. JFK was campaigning to be elected to a second term as Massachusetts’s senator and, if successful, there were strong rumours that he would make a run for the presidency in 1960. After several days taking pictures of husband and wife, Clark asked over lunch at the house if he could get a picture of the senator with his baby daughter, Caroline. “Jackie said no,” he recalled, “that she was upstairs asleep. But Jack bounded up the stairs, and I followed.”Clark took a spontaneous roll of film up in the nursery. It included this picture capturing the moment Caroline woke up, wide-eyed with delight to see her father. The nation was starting to share that excitement. Clark’s cover story for Life did much to advance the growing conviction that Kennedy was a leader for a new generation and a new decade. Up until that moment, presidents were far more likely to be grandparents than new dads, and family photographs were largely awkwardly staged compositions.Clark, who was based in Tennessee, had made his name in the aftermath of war, photographing the Nuremberg trials, and the bombed-out ruins of Germany and France. In 1962, aged only 51 and at the height of his powers, he was forced to give up his career at Life because of failing eyesight. A new surgical procedure partly restored his vision in 1980 and he returned to photography for the remaining 20 years of his life. The picture of Caroline Kennedy in her crib is included in a new book taken from the photographer’s personal archive. When he became president, JFK hung Clark’s picture in pride of place in the Oval Office Jackie purchased 75 prints.

Initially just two trains a day will operate, with services likely to be increased next year.Tickets will go on sale from 1 September, priced at £40 each way. They can be booked up to February 2021, allowing passengers to plan a Christmas or new year break in the Dutch capital.The introduction of the service comes amid uncertainty because of ongoing travel restrictions as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The UK government has removed the Netherlands from its list of countries people can travel to without having to quarantine on their return.Travellers who arrive back in the UK from the Netherlands after 15 August have to self-isolate for 14 days under coronavirus safety measures. Eurostar says it will offer more flexible booking options, including accepting changes to any booking at no cost up to 14 days before departure.The operator has also suspended its popular seasonal south France route – to Avignon and Marseille – until 2022, in order to focus on routes between London, Paris and Brussels which have the highest demand and shorter journey times.

They are not being treated well at all.” She said exit payments were also being forced down by workers on furlough being told to take at least a week’s holiday so that they would be owed less holiday pay when they left.Arcadia’s plans come weeks after the government rushed through legislation intended to prevent companies from using furlough rates of pay as the basis for redundancy settlements.A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: “We urge businesses to do right by their employees and pay staff what they are rightly entitled to. Those who do not could find themselves in front of an employment tribunal.”Arcadia’s proposals are subject to consultation until 26 August, but the group stage of the process has passed, meaning workers wishing to challenge the company’s stance would have to hire their own lawyers.In a letter to workers seen by the , Arcadia acknowledged there were “differing views in the circumstances” on basing notice pay on furlough rates, but said that based on the latest guidance and its own legal advice, it was confident it was acting lawfully, fairly and reasonably.The company claimed that several other retailers were proposing to pay furlough rates of pay to employees being made redundant. However, the  understands that major retailers currently making redundancies including M\u0026ampS, Boots, Debenhams, WH Smith, Dixons and John Lewis are all offering redundancy packages based on full rates of pay.A spokesman for Arcadia said: “The restructuring of our head office which we announced on 1 July is essential to ensure we can operate as efficiently as possible during these very challenging times. We remain in a consultation process with our head office staff and no decisions will be made until this process has concluded. Throughout this process we will be following all of the government guidelines and legislation. We are listening closely to all of their concerns throughout this process in what we know is a very difficult time.”Michael Newman, an employment law expert at Leigh Day, said he thought the terms Arcadia had offered to some staff were “open to legal challenge”.He said: “The indication from the government is clear – that redundancy payments should be based on pre-furlough pay. Furlough is just a grant giving a company money if you reach certain conditions. None of that changes the notice and redundancy payments, which are set in law and based on a normal week’s pay as set out in your contract.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa58181bacd23d8da933f26e519e25bc4c7d647f/0_446_4851_2913/master/4851.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d583454606897ec7e019182785dd44a2","title":"the commute completely transformed britain is it over for ever","story":"It helped create the suburbs, with countless towns thriving due to good transport links. Now it is under threat, with potentially huge consequences for our cities and social livesIt is 7.45 on a Monday morning and I am heading for the office. It is my first visit to the  for more than four months, but the prime minister wants us back at work. Commuters are reliable, law-abiding creatures of habit, cogs in a greater machine I am doing what I am told.On the way out of the house, I pass a 1910 Underground poster in the hall, extolling the merits of my particular suburb. “Live in a New Neighbourhood,” it reads, under a picture, by the artist Alfred France, of a brown country mouse welcoming a grey town mouse to a semi-rural idyll. “24 minutes from Piccadilly Circus, including change at Baker St. 6d per day for season ticket.”One hundred and ten years on (and for a bit more than 6d), I am living that same dream. But at Dollis Hill station, now on the Jubilee line, there are very few other commuters waiting on the platform. Before Covid-19, in the rush hour, you would often have to ruck and maul just to get on to a train. Today, there are only three people, masked and well-distanced, in the carriage. It does not get much busier as the journey continues. A couple more at Willesden Green, once a rural area with a few grand houses – until about 1870, when the builders moved in and began turning it into a working-class suburb for a new breed of commuter.The tube has never been a place for striking up friendly conversations. With masks and distancing, it is more eyes-down-make-no-contact than ever. Social media is an easier space to approach strangers. My eye was caught by a tweet from a passenger on the 8.08 from Surbiton to Waterloo, usually one of the busiest commuter trains in the country, with a video clip showing the empty carriage. Surbiton, AKA Suburbiton, is quintessential commuter belt, home to Tom and Barbara in the 70s sitcom The Good Life and likely the inspiration for the fictional Climthorpe, where the salaryman Reggie hit his midlife crisis in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin.“The 8.08’s usually pretty busy – I’d be standing in the door somewhere,” Charlie Deacon, who posted the video, tells me on the phone. He did not chat to his fellow commuters. “I recognised the same people most days, but I didn’t really know anyone.”Deacon, who works for a renewable energy company, worked from home throughout lockdown, but he has started coming in to the office once a week. “I’ve always been a proponent of flexible working, but it is also nice to have that one day in the office, to see the whites of people’s eyes.”Team meetings and complex projects are better dealt with in person than via video calls and endless emails, he says. But Deacon never wants to commute five days a week again. “I’m a lot less stressed, I don’t have to deal with the train, I’m saving lots of money I’m getting more sleep, more time to exercise, with my partner, to do other things in the evenings … It’s totally positive.”The journey, when he makes it, is a breeze, with seats available and space to breathe and distance, as his video shows. “This is about as busy as it gets,” mumbles a woman wearing a hi-vis jacket, a mask and a visor as she directs a handful of people in and out of King’s Cross station, where I emerge on my journey to work.Once upon a time, people walked to work, which tended to be in a field near where they lived. But the Industrial Revolution changed all that. You know the story: with industrialisation came urbanisation. Cities grew: Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow, as well as London. People flocked to them for work that was better paid than the work in the field and not seasonal. The downside was that these cities became filthy, overcrowded, polluted and diseased places.So, from the latter part of the 18th century into the Victorian era, those who could afford it started to move out to new suburbs and even the countryside beyond. As it was too far to walk to work, spiders’ webs began to appear on city maps – suburban rail networks. “Up to then, the purpose of the train was to get from one city to another,” says the author and historian Simon Webb, who probably knows more about the history of commuting than anyone else, having written a book on the subject. “As commuting took off, the purpose of railways became to bring people from one part of a city to another.”Webb’s book, Commuters: The History of a British Way of Life, looks at how commuting shaped our cities and gave rise to suburban railways, buses and underground trains (the first passengers rode the politan railway in London in 1863). From the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the rise of commuting was steady, with the odd surge, such as when buses or trams were introduced. Then, between the wars, it was like rush hour: one-third of the British population became commuters, thanks to unplanned development, with new urban areas springing up on the fringes of cities, and because of the mutually beneficial relationships that developed between railway companies and builders.Think of a commuter and whom do you see? Suited, probably male, takes himself quite seriously, a little humourless. Or the Reggie Perrin character, trapped in a railway carriage of hell, somewhere near Surbiton, but going nowhere in life. But today a commuter is as likely to be a nurse, a security guard, a cleaner, a cabinet minister or a “super-commuter” jetting in from her place in Nice every week.Even before Covid-19, Webb was wondering whether the commuter was dying out, because of the gentrification and recolonisation of city centres. It is happening to the centres of Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London – right here in King’s Cross, to where I have commuted. Until recently, it was dirty and dodgy after dark. Now it has sprouted shiny towers, desirable vertical urban living spaces. If I were wealthier, I might aspire to relocate here from my suburb. I can picture the poster: town mouse encouraging suburban mouse to come to where it is all happening.The pandemic means that, for many, it is no longer necessary to leave home, let alone your neighbourhood, to go to work. This may have the effect of making people more insular and isolated, says Webb. He tells me about some people who, during the Crusades, took off from a village in Gloucestershire when they reached Gloucester, they thought they had reached Jerusalem and prepared to fight the infidel. “Your outlook will probably become as restricted as that of a medieval peasant,” he jokes. At least, I think he is joking.A note of caution from Joe Moran, a social historian and a professor of English and cultural history at Liverpool John Moores University. Many key workers, he points out, don’t have the luxury of telecommuting “because they can’t do their work remotely. It’s non-key work that is more likely to disappear into fibre-optic cables and wireless routes.” Bankers in the City of London may be able to do their jobs from home, but that is not the case for security guards or supermarket staff.As a cultural historian, Moran is wary of the idea that things change suddenly and dramatically. “I feel that there is a natural inertia,” he says. “Even if there are very good reasons why people should commute less, that’s not how people engage with the world and other people. We often do things that don’t make any sense, because we are social beings.”Just as being at work is not only about the work, so commuting is not only about commuting, says Moran. While the situationist philosophers of 60s Paris may have regarded commuting as an unwanted product of capitalism, with its unpaid labour and alienating dead space, “some people actually quite like the commute, if it’s not too long. Partly because it’s time alone. It’s a sort of third space between home and work. Particularly with new technology, you can do lots of things with that time,” he says. “There is a slightly social aspect to it as well: you spend time with these intimate strangers often you see the same people on the train every day. There is a minimal community to it.”It is more than minimal for Anna Horsley, who has a train friend. It started one day when Horsley got some bad news in a phone call the woman next to her could not help overhearing, so asked if she was all right and offered a tissue. They got chatting. Soon they were taking the same trains every day, the 7.42 out and the 6.30 home. They have seen each other since they started working from home. “She’s invited me to her wedding,” Horsley says. “She’s gone beyond train friend – she’s a proper mate now.”Horsley, a social researcher, is – or was – a super-commuter. Her journey from Northampton to Westminster, by bike, train, tube and foot, took two hours. Then two hours home again in the evening. And she misses it. “I certainly don’t miss the cost of it, but I miss the routine it gave me. I find it harder to switch off and to get into work mode – I get out of bed and walk into my office, so I have no mental preparation for the day. And I tend to work past my hours.”Moran concedes that, when this is over: “People will have got used to working from home and it will be tolerated more. My workplace tended to encourage people to be present before presumably, those kind of attitudes will change. I think there’ll be less commuting, but I’m sure it will still go on. The key is to be flexible: if people want to go into work, they should be able to if they can work from home, that’s great as well.”This makes sense. Where does it leave me, though? I know where I am physically: I have done my commute, from a suburb created by commuting, along the world’s first metropolitan commuter railway, to a city centre abandoned by all but the poor that is now seeing the gradual return of the wealthy. I am here I have reached the office. But I don’t need to be here. I am not going in – I am off home, to work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a38d7f541102ceed29979a937eb7cf78f565f48d/0_95_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2b6940ff978fcc520acaabc95d20e4b0","title":"the guardian view on schools reopening a question of trust","story":"Boris Johnson and his government have badly mishandled the crisis in education due to Covid-19. Instead of giving moral lectures, the prime minister should give teachers and parents the support they needIn the six months or so since the Covid-19 pandemic struck, the government’s handling of its impact on schools has become emblematic of its flawed, haphazard and, at times, bullying approach.In May, Boris Johnson and his hapless education secretary, Gavin Williamson, tried to browbeat primary schools into reopening en masse the following month. Teachers pointed to an absence of proper preparation, resources and guidelines, and the government sulkily U-turned. It took the footballer Marcus Rashford to then persuade the prime minister to overturn the cruel policy of discontinuing free school meals during the summer holidays. Last week, after days of chaos and justified fury, the notorious exam algorithm that unfairly deprived teenagers of university places was first defended and then ditched. The resulting GCSE grade inflation has led to a sudden boom in the number of sixth formers, forcing some schools to recruit new staff at the last minute, in the worst possible circumstances. Government dithering, callousness and sheer incompetence have been making an inevitable crisis in education far worse for months.Next week, as both primaries and secondaries prepare to reopen, is the trickiest moment of all. So it is unlikely that many teachers or parents will be reassured by the words of the former minister, Theresa Villiers, who declared this week that Mr Johnson “is gripping this”. In a statement on Monday, the prime minister said that he considered it a moral duty to get children safely back to school. On this there is universal agreement as numerous teachers have attested, the Covid-19 hiatus threatens to have heartbreaking consequences for disadvantaged pupils in particular. But Johnsonian exhortation, important though it is for the prime minister’s political profile, is not much use when it comes to solving real-world dilemmas in a pandemic.The potential for a school to play a role in community spread of the virus is clear, given the number of households it draws together. A succession of outbreaks in German schools and elsewhere suggests that there is still a lot we do not know about transmission of the infection in schools the coming weeks are likely to be a matter of trial and error, as schools discover what is and isn’t working. Local test-and-trace capacity, vital to containing outbreaks, has improved but is still far from optimum. Establishing trust in the new systems and protocols, particularly in the case of local spikes, will therefore be fundamental to the successful reopening of schools. On that score, predictably, the government is not doing nearly enough.A week from the start of a new term like no other, the National Education Union is right to want greater clarity and precision on the next steps, in the case of virus outbreaks in schools. It also remains unclear what happens when there is a lockdown in a school’s local area and what the decision-making process will be. Little has been done to set up helplines for educational settings, which could offer support and advice as problems inevitably emerge. A request for confidence-building on-demand testing for teachers and pupils was turned down by the schools minister, Nick Gibb. With typical blitheness, a government spokesman said on Monday that remote education would be provided for children forced to re-isolate at home. Yet last week it was reported that only one-third of disadvantaged children promised free laptops by Mr Williamson in April had received them.At such a complex, fragile moment, confidence is the most precious of commodities. But the government is failing, again, to inspire it. Mr Johnson is right to say that there is a moral duty to get children safely back to school.

I really enjoy the simplicity of using just a few ingredients but it is still so tasty and has a deep flavour. Start by boiling potatoes and green beans in salted water while simultaneously cooking the pasta – spaghetti or linguine work best. You can make your own pesto by blending garlic, fresh basil and pine nuts with parmesan and olive oil. At home, I make a Swedish version with a variety of weeds from my garden, such as chickweed, nettles, hazelnuts, local aged cheese and cold-pressed rapeseed oil. Once the pasta and vegetables are cooked, drain and combine with the pesto before serving.Russell Norman, owner of Polpo, London and BrightonThe first time I had this dish was in a tiny little bacaro – a Venetian wine bar – probably the size of a standard suburban bathroom, with no seats. Now, it’s my family’s favourite pasta dish. It’s very specifically Venetian and something I always try to eat when I’m there, although it’s incredibly simple to make yourself. It’s like a thrilling taste of the sea.Bigoli is a type of spaghetti made with buckwheat, but you can use normal spaghetti, too. For two people, roughly chop two large onions and gently sauté in a couple of glugs of olive oil for 25 minutes. You want them to go really glossy and lose their structure. Then take a tin or two of anchovies and press them into the onions – they sort of disappear – to create a wonderful pale sauce. You could add a splash of wine at this point. Separately, cook your pasta, then add to the anchovy sauce along with a cup of the pasta water. Mix thoroughly, add fresh parsley and serve with a twist of black pepper.Rachel Khoo, chef, writer and host of Simple PleasuresWhen I’m on holiday, the last thing I want to do is be looking in a cookbook and trying to follow a recipe – I just want to throw everything in a pan, toss toss toss, easy peasy. I remember eating this dish on my first trip to Sweden: langoustines, cooked in butter with fresh parsley, with spaghetti, olive oil and a squeeze of lemon. No cheese – the Italians say you shouldn’t put cheese and seafood together anyway. How long you cook the langoustines depends on their size, so I just eyeball it. I love butter, so I used a good generous knob, salted. If you don’t have fresh parsley you can use chives. Squeeze your lemon over at the end – not at the beginning, because it evaporates.I cook the langoustines whole, in their shells, and then toss the spaghetti or linguine through the sauce you’ve created. It’s a little bit messy but that’s holiday food for you – you’re not in a rush. You can revel in the pleasure of eating with your fingers. Pairing with a nice crisp cold glass of rosé is always good, too. Masha Rener, Head Chef at Lina Stores, LondonMy husband’s grandmother is from Puglia and taught me how to make this orecchiette in Foggia style. This recipe is with the vegetable cima di rapa, the green top part of a turnip, boiled, then sautéed in extra virgin olive oil with garlic and chilli flakes. If you want, you can also add sausage or anchovies. This dish reminds me of being with family, back to times where we used to get together and harvest olives in November – we used to sit down and eat this orecchiette in the evenings. This is still one of my favourite dishes to have when I visit Puglia.Luca Conreno, chef and co-owner at La Lanterna, GlasgowThe dish I remember most from eating in Italy with my grandmother is bolognese with fresh tagliatelle. The pasta can be made using 1kg 00 flour, eight eggs and a bit of salt. You mix them together in a big bowl until you have a nice dough, then roll out and cut into ribbons. To make the bolognese sauce, I would use half pork mince and half beef mince (about 500g total). Add chopped onions, carrots and celery to the meat and fry with olive oil. After about 10 minutes, add a small glass of red wine and let it evaporate. Then, add chopped tomatoes or passata. Then cook for another 30 minutes. What really reminds me of Italy is tying a sprig of rosemary and three bay leaves together with string and adding it to the simmering bolognese sauce. My grandmother would tie the end of the string to the lid of the pot so she could pull it out like a fisherman. Fresh tagliatelle cooks very quickly so, after one minute of cooking in salted water, drain the pasta and add to the cooked sauce. Then, add two tablespoons of grated parmesan – this glues it all together. Simona Di Dio, co-owner and chef at Bottega Caruso, MargateThis is something we ate on our first holiday together as a family, in Castellabate on the Cilento coast. It was a very warm day and I was sceptical about eating pasta – I wanted something light and fresh, but I actually loved this dish so much. In the south of Italy it is quite common to have pasta and pulses for lunch. It’s filling and nutritious but inexpensive. In Campania, it’s traditional to add mussels, too.Since then, I have often recreated this dish at home. For two people, it’s 100g of dried cannellini beans, soaked overnight. Then, they’re cooked in plenty of water with a stick of celery, carrot, a few cherry tomatoes and a clove of garlic, for an hour or so. In a pan, sauté a clove of garlic in oil for five minutes before adding the mussels, which have already been cleaned. Put the lid on and cook on a high heat for 5-10 minutes until they open, then let them cool and de-shell (leaving a few in their shells for decoration). Keep the liquid from the pan. In another pan, sauté garlic, a stick of celery and parsley with a big handful of cherry tomatoes. Remove the celery, garlic and parsley before adding the beans and the mussel stock, then cook for 10 minutes on a low heat. Halfway through, add the mussels, salt and pepper, and chopped parsley. Meanwhile, cook the pasta (a short pasta is best) al dente, add it to the sauce, then serve. Chris Leach, chef and founder of Manteca, LondonThis is a classic dish from Bologna with tiny meat-filled pastas. The tortellini are very small – you can get eight to 10 on a spoon – and there are little pasta shops all over the city which specialise in making them. Each one is supposed to weigh 2g. I’d had this dish in restaurants I’d been working in over the years, but I had them properly, in Bologna, more recently and it was really special. I like it when the broth is quite rich and you really taste the nutmeg and the mortadella in the pasta. To make this yourself, you could just roast sausages in the oven, then puree them with some parmesan cheese, nutmeg and black pepper. If you were making fresh pasta, this would be your filling. Then, the pasta is served in a chicken broth (which you can make using leftover chicken bones, seasoned with salt and garlic).Alex De Martiis, co-owner of Sugo Pasta Kitchen, ManchesterThis dish is quintessential Puglia. I’ve got family there and there are loads of memories attached to it – it’s a very evocative dish. You’ll find it being eaten in households all over rustic towns such as Ceglie Messapica. Braciole is rolled beef – so it’s essential that you use the right cut. I tend to go for skirt steak, as this will have some fat on it and is perfect for slow cooking. You have to flatten it really thin and then stuff it the classic stuffing mix is breadcrumbs soaked in milk, with parsley and garlic. Lay the skirt steak out and lay a cured meat, such as prosciutto, on top of it. Then you add a little bit of stuffing, roll it up and tie it with string. Then brown the meat in a hot pan. The sauce is basically a ragu: onion, garlic, celery, carrot. Return the braciole to the pan with a load of red wine, let that bubble away and add tomatoes. You want it to simmer for 2-3 hours. Then you cook your pasta – fresh orecchiette is best. Remove the braciole from the pan, stir the pasta through the sauce, then serve with the braciole on top or on the side with a load of parmesan.Lara Boglione, managing director at Petersham Nurseries, LondonZucchinis are such a summer vegetable and this dish always transports me to the sunshine. You want the nice little baby courgettes, with their flowers if possible. Cut them finely, and fry along with the flowers and chunks of garlic – I like to add quite a lot – in olive oil. They’ll go soft and the edges will start to brown. Simultaneously, add pasta to salted water and boil – I think this recipe works best with spaghetti. Take a cup full of the pasta water and add to the bowl from which you’ll be serving your pasta and add a generous amount of parmesan, a little black pepper and olive oil. Mix so that it becomes a saucy paste. Add the pasta and the zucchini to the bowl and mix. You can serve it like that, which is very delicious, or if you want to be ultra indulgent you can mix in an egg yolk. It’s really good.Nicholas Balfe, founder and chef director of Salon, Levan and Larry’sPrawn linguine reminds me of evenings spent dining by the seaside in southern Italy. This is a good one for a date night as the prawns make it feel a bit more fancy, but it’s quick and easy to prepare so you’re not spending the whole time cooking and cleaning up. Get a skillet or frying pan medium hot with plenty of olive oil. If you are using dried pasta, get it on to boil now. Add some shallots and garlic and sauté with a pinch of salt for about three minutes. Add shelled prawns, season with salt, pepper and chilli flakes, stir everything to combine, and leave to sizzle for another couple of minutes before turning the prawns over, which should have turned pink.Add cherry tomatoes and leave for another minute. If you’re using homemadefresh pasta, get it in to boil now and cook until al dente, which will only take 1-2 minutes. Add white wine, turn the heat up and let everything bubble away for at least another minute while you grate in the lemon zest. When the pasta is cooked, lift it out of the water and into the skillet pan with prawns, etc. Add a knob of butter and squeeze of lemon and stir everything to combine. Add a little of the pasta water if you want the sauce wetter, before folding through torn basil leaves. Serve immediately with the rest of the white wine. aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

We can thank Sicilians for granita, who in turn acknowledge the Arabs, who, during their domination of the island, introduced sharbat, from the Persian “شربت”, which means a drink of sugar and water. Snow from Mount Etna and i Peloritani, a mountain range in north-east Sicily that has historically been used to cool wine, finally met sharbat and became granita (also sorbet and Roman grattachecca). It is a perfect example of how alimentary traditions never stay the same how, as food historian Massimo Montanari notes, “they change with time, becoming modified as they come into contact with other traditions”, how identity comes from exchange that traditions invent themselves.In the absence of an ice-cream maker, I often put things in the freezer – whole fruit, syrups, the end of the syrup of the cherries in wine, creams in the hope that they can be scratched or blended into something roughly good. This year, though, tethered to Rome in these white-hot, stinky days, and encouraged by my son, who enjoys suspending everything – Lego, leaves, Tampax – in ice, has been the summer of frozen things. Many were familiar – lemon granita (500ml lemon juice, 500ml water and 250g sugar) coffee granita (300ml strong espresso, 200ml water and 200g sugar) watermelon granita (a litre of juice, 100g sugar and the juice of a lime) and almond granita (a litre of unsweetened almond milk, 200g sugar).All of them follow the same procedure. Warm the liquids and sugar just enough to dissolve the sugar, pour into a shallow dish, leave to cool, then slide into the freezer. After an hour, use a fork to break down the newly formed crystals, pushing them down from the sides, and return to freezer. Repeat this process every half-hour, the initial fork swishing turning to scratching as the liquid ices and hardens.Our favourites, though, have been new freezings. A tin of pear halves in light syrup – a taste of my childhood and a favourite of my dad’s – blitzed into a puree, frozen, then scratched. Also, tins of alphonso mango pulp – booty from wonderful, multicultural Piazza Vittorio market, treated the same way. Whether lemon, coffee, melon, almond, pear, mango or any inventive mix you chose to invent, the key to granita is attention: the half-hourly trips to the freezer for a scratch, the ideal end point being a soft, crystalline slush that you can spoon into a bowl or glass. Of course, there is always the alternative of leaving the mixture alone, simply pouring it into moulds and making lollies. Without which I wouldn’t be here, my dad having wooed my mum by pulling over the ice-cream van he was driving one summer, from which he sold Orange Maids, strawberry Mivvies and squares of ice-cream sandwiched between two wafers.The mosquito coil was invented by a Japanese businessman called Eiichiro Ueyama in the late 1800s. Pyrethrum powder, which derives from the chrysanthemum plant, had long been use to repel insects, often mixed with sawdust. Ueyama mixed pyrethrum powder with dried orange peel and starch to make incense sticks, which his wife Yuki proposed he make thicker and form into a coil so they would last longer. The coils we buy here in Rome last about 40 minutes – 35 minutes if there is a welcome breeze, which means the smell might drift across our flat-roof terrace and into the kitchen, and possibly into the freezer as I scratch, the sound and a smell of summer cornered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0114d35f047bbe07355bb8642b5e22e6cb8713f/23_0_1594_957/master/1594.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ca694f3d43f34263a1f6e99bee26fb14","title":"chelsea close to 90m kai havertz deal and expect to land thiago silva","story":"Chelsea are on the verge of an agreement with Bayer Leverkusen over a £90m deal for Kai Havertz and are poised to Thiago Silva on a free following the defender’s exit from Paris Saint-Germain.Frank Lampard has focused on reshaping his attack since becoming manager last year and although he has already spent big on Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner, the chance to bring Havertz to Stamford Bridge is regarded as too good to ignore. The Germany winger is one of the best young talents in Europe and has been targeted in the past by Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Liverpool and Real Madrid.Chelsea, who were under a transfer embargo last year, are giving Lampard strong backing as they look to close the gap on Liverpool and Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. They are close to strengthening at left-back by buying Leicester’s Ben Chilwell for £50m, have offered Silva a deal and are poised to sign Havertz after negotiations with Leverkusen over a fee for the 21-year-old.Havertz, who has agreed a five-year deal, had made it clear he wanted to leave Leverkusen following their failure to qualify for the Champions League. Chelsea had an initial offer of €65m (£58.6m) plus €15m in add-ons rejected last week.Chelsea are expected to pay an initial €80m plus €20m in add-ons for Havertz, who is an international teammate of Werner. The deal would represent a coup for Lampard, who was keen for greater quality in attack after losing Eden Hazard to Real Madrid last summer.Ziyech brings creativity after joining from Ajax, Werner scored 34 goals for RB Leipzig last season and Havertz would add a further layer of class.Although there is some surprise at Chelsea targeting Havertz, Lampard often felt his team lacked cutting edge against negative opponents. Chelsea, who bought Ziyech for £37m and Werner for £47.5m, needed to widen their options in attack after relying on Hazard for so long. Pedro and Willian have left on frees, joining Roma and Arsenal respectively, and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Christian Pulisic, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham remain inconsistent at the highest level and suffered injuries last season.The need for more depth up front does not mean Chelsea have forgotten the need to improve their defence. They conceded 54 goals last season and have looked at RB Leipzig’s Dayot Upamecano, Atlético Madrid’s José Giménez, Brighton’s Ben White and West Ham’s Declan Rice. They are also interested in the Atlético goalkeeper Jan Oblak as a potential replacement for Kepa Arrizabalaga.However, those players will be difficult to sign this summer and Chelsea were presented with a quick fix when offered Silva last week. The Brazilian centre-back, whose contract expired following PSG’s defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League final, is set to accept Chelsea’s offer of a one-year deal with the option of another year and would provide Lampard with more experience. Fiorentina have offered Silva, who turns 36 next month, a two-year deal.Left-back has also been a problem position for Lampard and he is prepared to sell Emerson Palmieri, who has been strongly linked with Internazionale. Emerson has not agreed anything but Chelsea have pressed ahead with a move for Chilwell. The 23-year-old England international missed the end of last season with a heel injury but it is understood the problem will not stop the transfer. While the deal has not been finalised, Leicester could replace Chilwell by moving for Ajax’s Nicolás Tagliafico.Chelsea are looking to raise funds by shifting unwanted players and are close to sending Tiémoué Bakayoko on loan to Milan and the arrival of Havertz would raise doubts over Ross Barkley’s future. Rennes are interested in signing Fikayo Tomori on loan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae4cbd0be829b6947a5ccda9fefdf6b9fe403dc3/0_62_2917_1751/master/2917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77c8ded8d55ee4d40c894a22c9ee6e86","title":"luis suarez and ivan rakitic on notice as koeman starts barcelona clearout","story":"Luis Suárez, Ivan Rakitic, Arturo Vidal and Samuel Umtiti have been told they are not part of Barcelona’s plans as Ronald Koeman’s cull begins. With pre-season training scheduled to get under way in a week’s time, meanwhile, the uncertainty over Lionel Messi’s future continues. There has been silence from him, despite reports last week that he had told the new manager that he feels “more out than in”. Aged 33, he has one year on his contract.On Monday the Catalan radio station RAC-1 announced that Koeman had called Suárez to inform him that the club planned to rescind his contract and as the day went on the names kept coming. Rakitic, Vidal and Umtiti received similar calls telling them to leave. Philippe Coutinho, though, has been told that he will continue at the Camp Nou after a season on loan at Bayern Munich.The names of Sergio Busquets, Gerard Piqué and Jordi Alba, conspicuously absent from the list of “untransferables” offered up by the president Josep Maria Bartomeu and all over the age of 30, did not appear on the list of those being shown the door – suggesting that there is a chance that they continue. The Catalan newspaper Sport reported that Alba, who renewed his deal last year and whose contract runs until 2024, has been told he will stay.What happens now is far from clear. In the aftermath of Bartomeu’s strikingly short and public list of players who are “untransferable” – Marc-André ter Stegen, Clement Lenglet, Ousmane Dembélé, Nelson Semedo, Frenkie de Jong, Ansu Fati and Antoine Griezmann – Koeman had preferred to talk about an evolution rather than a revolution. There is also a significant difference between what the club plan to do and what they are ultimately able to do.The lawyers and representatives of those who have been told to leave must negotiate an exit. In some cases, Barcelona hope to be able to complete sales but, having publicly admitted that they want to move players on, a more likely solution is the termination of their contracts – at a cost for the club. Rakitic wants to rejoin Sevilla but the Europa League winners remain reluctant to pay a fee. Barcelona’s wage bill is more than €390m a year and they are desperate to bring that down.As for Messi, RAC1 reported last week that he had told Koeman he was not sure of his place at Barcelona, even though he was aware of the contractual ties that make a departure unlikely. Few clubs can afford him. His salary is the biggest in world football and his buyout clause is €700m (around £625m) although he can go for nothing at the end of this coming season and open negotiations with overseas clubs from January.“It is a pleasure to have a player like Messi in your team,” Koeman told the club’s TV channel. Internally, though, some may not be averse to the idea of a departure if a significant offer arrived – which is far from clear. So long, that is, that it can be portrayed as purely his decision. On Monday evening, ESPN said that Messi’s camp denies he had told Koeman he wanted to leave. A battle to control the messaging may have begun.Suárez, 32, also has a year on his contract, with an optional second which depends on the number of games he plays. He is the third-top scorer in Barcelona’s history. In an interview with El País this weekend he had said he believed he could still give Barcelona a lot and insisted he would accept a substitutes’ role, “as I have done throughout my career”.He also said no one had told him he was on a list of players to leave and the “person responsible” should contact him directly, rather than his finding out through the media. On Monday morning, Koeman did just that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8754db283416c8590808ae48c25f5f3540e2530e/0_126_1887_1132/master/1887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40667eb380295379e624298fbf575961","title":"manchester city chairman says he holds no grudge against uefa over ban","story":"Manchester City’s chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, has said there is no grudge against Uefa after the club’s successful appeal against a two-year ban from European competition.City won the case in July at the court of arbitration for sport, overturning the penalty imposed by Uefa after its adjudicatory chamber concluded the club contravened financial fair play regulations.“How I can help this club compete in this competition and win it and how to have a constructive relationship with Uefa, I think it’s the only way to go.”Mubarak welcomed Kevin De Bruyne being voted the EA Sports Premier League Player of the Year, which is decided by a fan vote and those of the 20 club captains and a panel of experts. The chairman expressed relief, suggesting City players have previously missed out because of the club they represent.“It was a combination of being pleased but also a bit relieved,” he said. “I was worried because we have seen it before with City players – them being overlooked for this very important award – and I was worried that Kevin would be overlooked this year, because in my view it was unquestionable. My vote was clear, obviously it is subjective because of who he plays for, but Kevin is the best player in the league this year.”City have signed Ferran Torres, a forward, and the defender Nathan Aké for a total £65.5m. Mubarak stated there would be more. “There are additional players we will be bringing in.”Oleksandr Zinchenko interrupted his wedding day to clarify his wife’s claim that City’s Champions League defeat by Lyon last month was Pep Guardiola’s fault.Guardiola’s team selection – leaving out Phil Foden, Bernardo and David Silva – and his 3-5-2 shape was pointed to. The defeat moved Vlada Sedan, Zinchenko’s partner who is a sports journalist, to criticise the manager on her YouTube channel. “To put it mildly, and in order not to swear, this is completely Guardiola’s fault,” she said.Zinchenko responded via Instagram. “We totally understand now that she shouldn’t post it on social media because she is my wife but she was now trying to make a journalist’s opinion on the manager of the team,” he said. “She was simply reacting to her disappointment as a fan.“I’m writing right now from my wedding and instead of enjoying that unbelievable moment I have to do this because I can’t skip it and leave it like that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30c2ae915c9d3011722846ec15f10eddaa10fa5/0_119_6538_3923/master/6538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87d982eeadfaa8173a60aa6f708733de","title":"mathieu flamini former arsenal midfielder sustainability athletes positive impact","story":"Former Arsenal midfielder has made sustainability his life goal and wants more athletes to follow the example set by Marcus RashfordMathieu Flamini wants to be certain we are getting down to business. “I’m quite hyperactive as you know,” he says. “If we’re beginning the interview I need to start walking around. Sitting down is something I’m not good at doing for a long time.”Moments later he is off and running. At times over the next hour it feels hard to keep pace, the ideas pinging around in a manner familiar to anyone who can picture him eating up the yards during the peak of his football career. Flamini is on a mission. He wants athletes to seize their opportunity, in fractured and rudderless times, to disrupt the status quo and use their voices meaningfully. He would like them to channel their life experience and, when the subject matter is relevant, become activists. Essentially, he would like more of them to follow in the footsteps of Marcus Rashford.“I sent him a message telling him: ‘You’ve made us all very proud, you’ve been an inspiration,’” he says of his reaction to the government U-turn prompted by Rashford’s articulate, persistent and flawlessly reasoned argument that free school meal vouchers should be continued over the summer. “We all have to stand together so more and more athletes can understand they have a social responsibility, and can use their platform to drive positive change. We don’t accept being told to shut up any more.”Flamini is not merely sounding off. While Rashford can speak compellingly about the sacrifices his mother made during his childhood in Wythenshawe, the former Arsenal midfielder found much of his own world view shaped when growing up in southern France. His involvement as co-founder of GF Biochemicals, a dazzlingly successful entity that focuses on finding sustainable alternatives to oil-based products, is well known and bears no resemblance to tropes around footballers discovering sidelines in, say, real estate.“Growing up by the sea, I could see from a very early age the impact of plastics in the water, on the beach,” he says. “It’s horrendous and makes you realise that, if we don’t change something, the place where we live won’t be liveable any more. I was very aware of everything, very curious. I always told myself: ‘If I do something else later on outside football, I want it to be around sustainability.’“The opportunity came along, we started, and I was not very knowledgeable around everything when I began. But through the years I’ve become part of this world of passionate people who give their lives to put the planet, the environment, the sea, before even themselves. It’s very inspiring but what they are missing is a voice, a platform. So as a footballer I’ve always tried, after developing my knowledge, to create awareness and make a small impact myself.”What he calls his “journey around sustainability” began with GF Biochemicals’ birth in 2008, when he was 24. It happened during a year in which he enjoyed the best season of his life at Arsenal and earned a move to Milan. Even for a man who just kept on going – the sight of Flamini fuelling himself with colossal bowls of pasta at the London Colney training ground was a common one – there should not be enough hours in the day. But he says such weighty external interests affected his football positively, constituting “an escape, clearing my mind, refreshing myself to come back stronger”.During his second spell in north London teammates would look on in a mixture of amusement and genuine interest when, after training, he would change into a suit and drive off to a meeting. Héctor Bellerín, a kindred spirit, reminded him of that recently. “He told me: ‘I was thinking, wow, one day I also want to do something like that.’ We need more players like Héctor that are thinking outside the box, using their platform to create a positive impact. We speak too much about negative things. Let’s speak about beautiful things let’s speak about love, let’s unite people.”By now he must have completed several laps of the building – in France, though he is based in London – in which he is taking the call. The thoughts keep coming, though: Flamini is particularly interested in how elite footballers, blessed with access to some of the best doctors and nutritionists, can exert a direct influence in public health. At length, he expounds the benefits of cutting animal protein and dairy, while increasing one’s water intake, and how such decisions need not only benefit athletes. There is, he believes, an obvious place to begin informing wider society.“I was reading about the UK standing up to obesity, the NHS being under a lot of pressure and the government doing a campaign around it. Great, finally we are talking about it – so why don’t we involve athletes, footballers, in pushing these messages to educate younger generations? Football has a role to play here. Let’s bring players into schools to speak about how important it is to eat healthily, and let’s use social media. If we want to reach a large number of kids, that’s how we need to do it.”Flamini worries young people are “living in a system that is killing the dreams of their generation” and, more than once, points to a lack of trust in established institutions. The space between them is the one he thinks sportspeople, with their huge social media followings, can inhabit and use to bring back that faith in public figures.Although now a businessman enjoying considerable success, he still wants to be viewed as a footballer. The sport is, he stresses, the first thing he thinks about upon waking up. As recently as last year he was playing in La Liga for Getafe all that conditioning acumen has helped ensure that, at 36, he still feels more than physically capable. “Everything is possible,” is all he will offer on the topic of a comeback in the meantime he stays in constant touch with developments at Arsenal, expressing particular satisfaction at the managerial promise of his former teammate Mikel Arteta.“It was always clear he’d go in the direction of coaching,” he says. “Even back then, he’d mention it. I’m very happy the club has trusted an ex-player because for too many years that was missing at Arsenal: someone who feels, breathes and lives the club. I really hope he’ll be successful and that we’ll be one of the main contenders very soon.”Now he is taking a seat once more and the camera, switched off while he darted about, is back on. We are finishing up but it is clear that, for Flamini, this will only be a momentary pause. “These days people really value authenticity, honesty and transparency,” he says. “We have a great opportunity to help so many people in our communities. For me, a champion is someone who not only wins on the pitch, but takes the lead off it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19ed0583483c6c03a5939f88a6d2ad4d622ec0fc/0_81_847_508/master/847.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=20f269bee1f7719c8e91e0847fa14bc0","title":"david olusoga racism in tv has led to lost generation of black talent","story":"Lack of BAME people in executive and behind-camera roles down to being ignored or worn down by industry, says historianSystemic racism in British television has forced out a generation of black talent who quit because they were being ignored or worn down by their experiences, the industry’s leaders were told last night.In a devastating critique, the prominent broadcaster and historian David Olusoga said the impact of this “lost generation” could be seen in unrepresentative programmes that failed to reflect modern Britain.Delivering the keynote MacTaggart lecture at the virtual edition of the Edinburgh television festival, Olusoga said a recent incident where the BBC defended the decision to use the N-word on air had “genuinely damaged faith in the BBC among many black people” and would not have happened if there were more senior black staff in newsrooms.Olusoga, who spent the early part of his television career as a producer, said his own experience of the British television industry had left him feeling so “isolated and disempowered” that he was diagnosed with clinical depression.“I’ve come close to leaving this industry on several occasions. And I know many black and brown people who have similar stories to tell.”“They left because even when they got work, their voices were too often not listened to their stories too often were not of interest to the tastemakers and programme pickers who, over the same period, grew ever more powerful within the structure of TV. They’re not here now because we didn’t have the will to keep them and – worn out by it all – they gave up on our industry.”His comments come at an acutely sensitive time for the media as leaders grapple with the fallout from the Black Lives Matter movement. And they echo sustained criticism of the industry’s racism in recent years. Two years ago, Michaela Coel, the creator of I May Destroy You, used the MacTaggart lecture to describe her experience of racism and sexual assault, while in 2014 Sir Lenny Henry told an audience at Bafta that black British actors were having to go to the US to build their careers.Olusoga said that while television is becoming more erse on screen, progress at the top of the food chain has been slower. “There is willingness to accept black people as performers, in front of the camera, but unwillingness on the part of the industry to make space for them behind the scenes, in the rooms where the decisions are made and the real creativity happens,” he said.“When I became a presenter, I could not help but notice that that our industry was far more comfortable with me in that capacity than it ever has been with me as a producer.”He also said the media regulator Ofcom should require broadcasters to have racially erse staff rather than simply produce reports highlighting the issue – or be replaced by a regulator that is willing to take tough enforcement action.Olusoga, who runs his own television production company while serving as professor of public history at the University of Manchester, said the iniduals who commission television programmes are drastically unrepresentative of the audiences they served. As a result, black people in the industry are constantly having to deal with accusations that they are troublesome or awkward when they make points to those iniduals.“One colleague I worked with complained endlessly that I was especially difficult. I was difficult whenever I talked about the sensitivities of black history, or warned of the danger of racial tropes, or of unintentionally reinforcing racial stereotypes. I was, they told me, too political, too sensitive, too difficult.“But my colleague had a solution. What I needed to do, I was told, was to be more like another black person they knew. This other black guy was far more relaxed, less caught up in all of this history stuff, he didn’t feel the need to discuss race, racism, stereotypes and all the other annoying stuff. If only I could be more like him, because then we would all just ‘get along’. This ideal black guy was someone my colleague would hang out with. He’d come round their house and listen to music – in perfect racial harmony.“As this piece of advice went on, and I learned more details about this ideal black person, I began to wonder if perhaps the reason they were so unthreatening, so relaxed and so laid back might have been because the black person I was being urged to emulate was my colleague’s cannabis dealer.”He highlighted the case of Marvin Rees, who was a BBC journalist in Bristol before quitting the corporation and later becoming the city’s directly elected mayor. “When I asked Marvin Rees why he had finally given up and left the industry, this is what he said: ‘The truth is, the BBC just wore me down with hopelessness.’”“If, however, in another alternative existence, Marvin might have been there, or on the end of the phone, as a senior colleague, to give advice, that incident, that has genuinely damaged faith in the BBC among many black people, might have been avoided.”Many of the major announcements at the television festival concerned ersity and the elevation of black voices. The BBC’s director of content, Charlotte Moore, said the television industry would “not survive” if it did not embrace ersity and highlighted the forthcoming five-part series Small Axe by director Steve McQueen.Earlier in the day, former BBC journalist Marcus Ryder asked panellists at the television festival whether questions of media ersity were too fixated on traditional channels: “Are we focusing on too much on BBC and Channel 4 and not enough on platforms like Netflix? Are we being too old-fashioned about this?”Duane Jones, who runs his own production company, said the new streaming companies had an advantage over many established outlets: “I feel like the less traditional platforms are more open-minded when it comes to working with erse talent and company founders like myself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f37e51f606ebe7dc66de075ab470ff414822fb/0_137_3579_2148/master/3579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8fac7795af3e501f936f5f0b609a65","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

That said, the festival, co-founded by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan, promoted a narrow form of feminism in its initial incarnation: Tracy Chapman and India.Arie were among the few black artists on a roster that skewed towards the “sensitive” end of the musical spectrum, as the Observer put it at the time.The festival’s second incarnation, however, branched out into edgier territory with the likes of Erykah Badu, Liz Phair and a breaking rapper hailing from Portsmouth, Virginia, named Missy Elliott. She already had a platinum-certified 1997 debut album, Supa Dupa Fly, and an iconic image immortalised in video collaborations with Hype Williams. But her sets at Lilith Fair, beginning in Palm Beach, Florida, on 26 July 1998, would be her first live performances ones that demonstrated the potency of this legend in the making and expanded industry perceptions of what gigs could even be.Only 25 at the time, Elliott was making a name for herself in the intensely masculine world of hip-hop. The genre was in flux, partly in the wake of the deaths of 2Pac and the Notorious BIG, and inventive artists such as Melissa Arnette Elliott could thrive: with a debut album recorded in just two weeks, her withering flow was partnered with a futurist sound: Timbaland instrumentals that Ed Simons of the Chemical Brothers said at the time had “an English experimental feel” to them. Supa Dupa Fly felt more in line with the optimism of the new millennium than the strife of the 90s Missy said: “Rap’s coming around again to stuff that isn’t all about discussing negative things. That’s why I think my music may be getting over.”Edward Helmore of Mojo magazine claimed in April 1998 that “an invitation to join Lilith was an opportunity to demonstrate industry clout and a public display of unity”. This much is evident throughout Elliott’s set, the first time she used the nickname “Misdemeanor”.The first misdemeanours were her outfits, including one reused from the music video for hit single The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly): imagine a black Michelin woman. With mute “video vixens” the pervasive face of femininity in rap music videos at the time, Elliott’s inflatable black orb was a clear indication of an artist doing things on her own terms. Her frame didn’t match the typical vixen silhouette, and so she played on this in the most extreme way possible, pointing to the absurdity of those who might use her weight against her to undermine her talent. She represented middle America’s worst nightmare: a gigantic black woman in full command. More prosaically, it was also difficult to move about on stage in the outfit, demonstrating Elliott’s dedication to putting on a spectacle. “Why was I in that?” she replied to a fan wondering about the outfit on Twitter last year. “I don’t know – cuz I’m Missy.”Elliott came on stage to Breathe by the Prodigy, signposting her unpredictability and irreverence accompanied by a live band, her sets only lasted around 15 minutes, but left the crowd “stunned” according to Rolling Stone’s Rob Sheffield. This rule-breaking set her apart, along with her cartoonish playfulness. While there were several other male acts such as Busta Rhymes, Wu-Tang Clan and Outkast who were tapping into a more exuberant image during the “shiny suits” era of rap, Elliott pointed towards outright fantasy, where aesthetics could be transcendent. Many hip-hop artists, like Elliott, had a tough upbringing, amid poverty and a violent father, and her wild creativity perhaps comes from wanting to make art that hoists you out of your circumstances through sheer imagination.Everything is carefully curated and had wider meaning for Elliott, right down to the Betty Boop finger waves in her hair and her ruler-length coloured acrylic nails. This was a look that was distinctly black, not watered down to suit the once melanin-deficient Lilith Fair. Helmore compared Elliott’s bravado to that of Chaka Khan, suggesting that she “breathed new life into a genre that has been in danger of setting rigid as karaoke with beats” and that she was “destined to become hip-hop’s first female media mogul”, an accolade that she achieved, and then some.A review of the set from Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo commented that Elliott “spent more time changing clothes during the performance or running through the audience than singing”, clearly a criticism, but actually pointing to one of the most pioneering aspects of Elliott as an artist. This month saw the release of the music video for WAP by Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B. The concept was clearly an homage to the black camp aesthetic that Elliott perfected at the beginning of her career: seeing the two artists stroll down the corridor of an ostentatious and surreal mansion is a clear callback to Elliott’s Beep Me 911 and their kinship is arguably reminiscent of that of Elliott and fellow female rap pioneer Lil’ Kim. Elliott was quoted as saying in i-D Magazine in 1998, “if I was to talk and rap what everyone else sung about, it wouldn’t make me special … Hopefully females that might have been scared to go out there and be a writer and producer will see that I’m successful and give it a try.” This mindset is her legacy, clearly apparent in rap today. The recent cadre of female rappers such as Flo Milli, CupcakKe and Megan Thee Stallion are clearly drawing on the misadventure and unashamed filth that made us fall in love with Elliott.Though there is little archival documentation of Elliott’s Lilith Fair sets, they are indicative of something much bigger. Elliott, now in the fourth decade of her career, is both benchmark and blueprint for much of the female-led hip-hop and campy pop that is now ever-present. At Lilith Fair, she blew up, in every sense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e901be841c4d95df745c4bb1c5705f9e99ea95b2/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7638ab7f96fd1580f77c3d41f377c0a 700w","title":"my blue passport has arrived and with it a crushing new sense of our brexit nightmare","story":"We definitely are not in the EU any more. No stars, just a lion, a unicorn and a peculiar illustration of the UK. Yet that’s not even the worst thing about this documentIn February, I lost my passport in the stupidest way yet. I was not mugged, pickpocketed or burgled (passports one to three), I did not drop it in a pond (passport four), or lose it in a house move (passport five), I just walked through a station in a bit of a daze, and by the time I got to my platform, it was gone. I tried to self-soothe with the fact that, at least I now had time to renew before the blue ones came in, but that plan did not square with the global pandemic, and the document arrived today, as blue as midnight and also as dark.Some observations: we definitely are not in the EU any more. There are no stars, just a lion, a unicorn and a peculiar and bereft illustration of the UK, with Northern Ireland a floating blob, the rest of the landmass etched out like Trotsky’s face. I don’t know why I should find this so disappointing. Obviously on some subconscious level, I thought it was all a dream, or a joke.The colour, meanwhile, is not the nostalgia kick you might have hoped for, if that was your thing, since it genuinely is blue, while the pre-EU ones looked more like black. This somehow says it all about the Brexit project, that it would fight to the death over a principle that was trivial and wrong. Three flowers and a shamrock are embossed on the back, for poetry I suppose, except the daffodil could be any flower, and the overall effect is of someone finding free graphics on the internet for a superbly boring PowerPoint presentation.Yet by far the worst thing about it was my own photo, as ever, contriving to look meaner and more like Myra Hindley than the last, which was itself the worst picture I had ever taken. Remarkably, and powerfully, this lifted my spirits. Some things never change. Every passport has a worse photo than the last – even, mysteriously, one you lost after only six months.

On Monday this became a waiting game especially for England fans yearning for something to celebrate.The obstacles came from the weather (of course) and from some excellent, obdurate batting from Pakistan on a pitch that declines to deteriorate. Around the corner was the possibility of an England victory and, as we have been reminded so frequently, Jimmy Anderson’s 600th Test wicket and that is where those landmarks remained. As things stand the latter is more likely to take place than the former on the final day. Pakistan are 100 for two and Anderson took the wicket of Abid Ali, his 599th in Test cricket.It was not a good day to drop what seemed like a straightforward catch behind the stumps since there were so few chances of taking a wicket. Not for the first time in his career Anderson found the edge of Shan Masood’s bat the ball sailed towards the gloves of Jos Buttler but never actually hit them. It must have deviated treacherously before hitting Buttler’s thigh. On this occasion Anderson was more mystified than mortified. After the chaos of Sunday night this was the fourth drop off Anderson’s bowling in 37 deliveries.We have been informed that on Sunday night these dropped catches stemmed from dangerously dark light on Monday morning from devious swing after the ball has bounced. But they say it has absolutely nothing to do with the imminence of Anderson’s 600th wicket, which might add a bit of tension to those hands.The impression given is that no one in the dressing room is conscious of an impending record wins rather than personal landmarks are the goal. Well, yes, maybe, but these things are not mutually exclusive there is no shame in being conscious of the stats. Players expressing surprise about personal records, their own or somebody else’s, are not always convincing. In a distant era the protestation “I never read the papers” was always dodgy, especially after a good day. Some are motivated by the stats the great Richard Hadlee was one of them and Stuart Broad probably is today this does not make them lesser cricketers it may enhance them.Admittedly Anderson gives the impression that he is not too bothered by landmarks they seem a bit of a hindrance to him. He may not want all that attention. It took him an age to get past Ian Botham’s 383 in the Caribbean in 2015. Here the news bulletins have decided that Anderson’s 600 is a national event. This does not appear to have affected the bowler greatly, just the catchers.So there was frustration for England. Ollie Pope was compelled to leave the field after damaging his left shoulder trying to save a boundary nothing much was happening out there and then it started to rain. After an early lunch Broad managed the breakthrough when Masood padded up against him. Masood reviewed but he need not have bothered since it was the impeccable (so far) Michael Gough who had raised his finger.This heralded the arrival of Azhar Ali, who might have been expected to open the batting since he appeared on Sunday night with Masood. However it transpires that since the umpires took the players off before announcing that play had started Pakistan could resume with their normal opening pair.Azhar was watchful yet assured from the start of his innings. He was now moving automatically into the right position. Before his century on Sunday one could sense him fretting about that. At the other end Abid was digging in dutifully, deflecting the ball away for his runs. The pitch was now brown and true and the ball soft.Soon Root turned to Dom Bess but there was not much help for him either – except from the experts in the commentary box. Earlier in the day he had enjoyed chatting to Shane Warne on the subject of spin bowling – and who wouldn’t? So every delivery seemed to be scrutinised. It was just as well Bess had discarded his earpiece by then.Bess bowled perfectly well. There is a tricky balance to be found especially for a young spinner, bowling on a true surface to Pakistan batsmen who are adept against slow bowling. The yearning is to have him aiming wider of off-stump in pursuit of either edge of the bat but the margin of error when bowling that line is greatly reduced.Bess has advanced significantly over the past 18 months he is eager to listen and improve. Now there is more energy on the ball and he has become more accurate he is also learning how to bowl on non-spinning pitches. His meteoric rise came about because he had the opportunity to play on helpful surfaces at Taunton without that he would not be anywhere near the England team. As I may have mentioned before, in the modern game the spinner leaving the bat has become more successful, partly because they can benefit from those “DRS” lbws and this summer there have been a lot of right‑handers in the opposition. Hence Bess has had a tough gig.Eventually Anderson found a glimmer of reverse swing and Abid was lbw just before bad light and more rain intervened. No doubt the slip cordon, like everyone else, will be on red alert when he resumes on Tuesday (weather permitting)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/292fbccd675f8985bdd4eb40fc843408b86f9dd8/223_41_2777_1667/master/2777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bbd1fc539ebac3b6ee32b470422163f","title":"england v pakistan third test day four live","story":"Jimmy Anderson moved one wicket away from 600 Test dismissals as Pakistan reached 100-2 amid the downpours As feared, play has been abandoned. The day belongs to Pakistan’s top order, who reacted to being blown away in the first innings by being thoroughly solid in the second. In 56 overs, they have lost only the openers, both LBW, both umpire’s call. Azhar Ali came out to bat for the third time in the match – file that one away if you’re a pub quizzer – and simply carried on where he had left off last night. He has now faced 364 balls in this Test and scored 170 runs. Jimmy Anderson found some reverse swing to take one wicket and reach 599 in Tests, but now he’ll have to sleep on it and hope that the rain forecast for the morning is erted in the night. The last word goes to Brendan Large, the visionary reader who worked out just before Stuart Broad did that yorkers were the way to go when faced with a soft ball and a slow pitch. “Can we all agree,” he pleads, “that it was a mistake not to start at 10.30 today and ensure that we plan to tomorrow, whatever the forecast? If England are one wicket short at the end, that may well have been the difference.”Thanks for your company, your emails and your erudite comments on the terminology of cricket in Russian. “For me,” says Jim Haddow, “Joe Root is not a great inspirational captain. He does not have the character and charisma to lift a side when they are down and not much seems to be happening. These are the very times when you need your captain to lift the mood of his side, instil the belief in them that the most unlikely breakthrough not only can happen, but is probably just about to! Like Warney and the great Botham used to kid batsmen and sow doubt in their minds, even when the pitch was completely placid.“There is always the risk of upsetting dressing-room morale if you change a popular and respected captain, but he does not seem to be the most tactically astute and his batting form is not overwhelming either. I feel at the right moment he should be replaced as captain and left to focus on his batting. He will have to improve even in that department to be assured of his place in the side, as England seem to have plenty of exciting options coming through.” That’s a bit harsh on his batting – he’s so good at his best that his place should be safe for quite a while. But I have to agree about the captaincy. If he were to give it up, which he shows no sign of wanting to do, England would lose nothing in terms of leadership, and gain a fair amount in terms of runs. He’s such a likeable guy that he would surely be able to cope with no longer being the boss. He slots easily into the one-day team under Eoin Morgan, who is the great England captain of the age. And raining hard. That is surely that for the day.Time for another Russian lesson. “No no no Iain,” says Oleg Smirnov, spying the 35th over. “Off to the back of the class you go. точки means points only in the sense of geometrical points (or a typographical period). очки is exactly the right word for points or runs scored. And yes it also means spectacles. And in the singular (очко), the colloquial meaning is sphincter or toilet. And очко играет (literally, a playing sphincter) would be the appropriate colloquial expression for the sensation produced in a batsman by a well-directed Archer bouncer.” Good to have got to the bottom of it.And off they go, with Jimmy Anderson stuck on 599. He may be asking the team analysts if they can check the forecast.56th over: Pakistan 100-2 (Azhar Ali 29, Babar Azam 4) A couple of singles off Root and up comes Pakistan’s hundred. It’s been a doughty performance, decidedly old-school.55th over: Pakistan 98-2 (Azhar Ali 28, Babar Azam 3) Bess continues and produces one good ball, which Azhar inside-edges into his pad. Pulling himself together, Azhar plays a classy guide for three. The camera finds Anderson. “He looks like someone about to be sung to on their birthday,” says my daughter, who has joined me on the sofa. “Pleased, but awkward.”54th over: Pakistan 93-2 (Azhar Ali 25, Babar Azam 1) Regrettably, Anderson is not going to show us how to bowl spin. Joe Root brings himself on, round the wicket, and slips in a leg-break amid the gentle off-spin. Babar gets off the mark with a flick to square leg.53rd over: Pakistan 92-2 (Azhar Ali 25, Babar Azam 0) Meanwhile old man Azhar just keeps rolling along. He’s now faced 354 balls in this match without being dismissed once. The umpires seem to be saying that the light is too bad for fast bowling. In which case, Anderson should just bowl some slow leg-cutters.52nd over: Pakistan 90-2 (Azhar Ali 23, Babar Azam 0) Back to Anderson, who lets Azhar have a single off his legs, possibly on purpose, so he can have a go at the new batsman. The all-seeing Michael Gough has got the light meter out, and the groundstaff are getting the covers ready. Noooo....51st over: Pakistan 89-2 (Azhar Ali 22, Babar Azam 0) Breaking news: Bess is off! Back comes Jofra Archer, bowling bouncers from round the wicket with a catcher on the leg side, almost as if he thinks he’s Stuart Broad. There’s nobody at first slip, but then, it’s not easy keeping the runs down when you’re 220 ahead and your opponents are racing along at 1.8 an over.50th over: Pakistan 88-2 (Azhar Ali 21, Babar Azam 0) The man is a phenomenon. If he gets the 600th wicket in the next 13 deliveries, he will have done it quicker, in terms of balls, than anyone else. He is already, as you know, the most prolific seamer of all time.Umpire’s call! And that is Test wicket no. 599 for Anderson. The end of a fine rearguard from Abid Ali, who faced 162 balls and hit only two of them for four. Given by Michael Gough, so it may well be out, but it is a bit leg-stump-ish...49th over: Pakistan 87-1 (Abid Ali 42, Azhar Ali 20) Bess continues, even though he is making nothing happen and there’s some reverse for the seamers. I feel like Michael Spicer in The Room Next Door. 48th over: Pakistan 87-1 (Abid Ali 42, Azhar Ali 20) There is a change at the other end, as Broad gives way to his old mate Anderson. Can he make something happen? He hasn’t taken a wicket in the second innings this summer, which means another five-for is just around the corner. He finds some movement right away, beating the outside edge, but Azhar gathers himself and punches into the covers for a couple. 47th over: Pakistan 85-1 (Abid Ali 42, Azhar Ali 18) A pause, a drink, a chance to come up with something different – and Joe Root decides the answer is to have an 11th successive over from Dom Bess. It goes for one run. If there was a crowd in, they might be tempted by the slow handclap.46th over: Pakistan 84-1 (Abid Ali 42, Azhar Ali 17) Paging Brendan Large! Broad bowls not one yorker but two, one from over the wicket, the other from round. “Didn’t quite get the length right,” says Michael Holding, which is a bit like having Picasso commenting on your painting. Then out of nowhere Broad swings the ball in, possibly a sign of reverse swing. “Broad’s got something happening,” says Ian Ward. Thank God someone has. And that’s drinks, with Pakistan winning the last hour, in a quiet way. England have taken one wicket in 46 overs and shown little urgency. Do they not know how bad the forecast is? 45th over: Pakistan 84-1 (Abid Ali 42, Azhar Ali 17) Bess appeals for LBW against Abid, but there’s a thick inside edge. Azhar square-drives for a couple. Come on Joe, time to take Bess off and get Anderson back on. He does have a bit of an incentive.44th over: Pakistan 80-1 (Abid Ali 41, Azhar Ali 14) Broad gets a talking-to from the great Michael Gough. My guess is that he’s saying “Aren’t you a bit elderly to be an enforcer?” And then, right on cue, Broad bowls a yorker. Abid digs it out comfortably enough but still, Brendan Large, you have made your mark on the game.43rd over: Pakistan 80-1 (Abid Ali 41, Azhar Ali 14) Another helping of bread and butter from Bess. It’s mystifying that Jack Leach hasn’t even made the XIV for one Test this summer.“Hey Tim,” says Brendan Large, “what’s the reason that Test cricket teams don’t use more yorkers? I understand they are more difficult in terms of effort but couldn’t the express bowlers like Archer and Wood mix them a bit more with the short stuff? Or is it too easy for top-class batsmen?” That’s a great question. The yorker was good enough for Michael Holding.42nd over: Pakistan 79-1 (Abid Ali 40, Azhar Ali 14) After failing to ruffle Abid, Broad feels his senior citizen’s version of Bodyline may yet work on Azhar. He thinks he’s got him, poisoned down the leg side, but Michael Gough says no and Joe Root knows a review would be wasted. Sure enough, the reply shows the ball flicking Azhar’s shirt. 41st over: Pakistan 79-1 (Abid Ali 40, Azhar Ali 14) Bess goes back to being Mr Uneventful, stringing together some dots before Azhar takes a quick single off a thick edge to point.“Fascinated to follow the Russian cricket terminology,” says Brian Withington. “Wondering whether an opposition batsman caught behind leg glancing would be referred to as ‘poisoned’ rather than ‘strangled’?” Heh heh.40th over: Pakistan 78-1 (Abid Ali 40, Azhar Ali 13) Joe Root gets the message and summons Stuart Broad, but he too gets tickled to fine leg for four. He’s coming round the wicket, with a leg slip and a short square leg, looking to bomb Abid and his sore finger. Abid sees this cunning plan and says, “I’ll just get out the way”. By the time he bowls the sixth ball, Broad has gone back over the wicket.39th over: Pakistan 74-1 (Abid Ali 36, Azhar Ali 13) Abid decides it’s time for a sweep and paddles Bess fine for three. Azhar then gets four in the same direction with a nice little tickle. Come on Joe, make something happen.38th over: Pakistan 67-1 (Abid Ali 33, Azhar Ali 9) Azhar, facing Woakes, plays the shot of the session, a gentle push past mid-on that’s so well timed, it goes for four.37th over: Pakistan 62-1 (Abid Ali 32, Azhar Ali 5) Bess keeps plugging away and gets a moral victory as Abid edges another arm ball, but it’s wide of slip and brings only a single. 36th over: Pakistan 61-1 (Abid Ali 31, Azhar Ali 5) If you had to back an England bowler to get a top-order batsman top-edging a bouncer over the slips, that bowler would surely be Archer, but it’s just happened to Azhar and the man responsible was Woakes. What a trouper he is.35th over: Pakistan 59-1 (Abid Ali 31, Azhar Ali 3) Bess has an appeal for caught at short leg as Abid plays outside a bouncy off break, but it was off the thigh pad, and miles from the bat.Back to Russian. “I think ‘ochki’ (очки) as suggested by Robin Haslehurst as runs or points is wrong,” says Iain Noble. “The Russian word for points is tochki (точки). The word ‘ochki’ also means a pair (of spectacles) so that is the likelier meaning.” Then he adds: “Arthur Ransome, former foreign correspondent of this great organ, married Trotsky’s secretary.” Random but riveting.34th over: Pakistan 59-1 (Abid Ali 31, Azhar Ali 3) Off goes Jofra as Root sticks to his new policy of giving him short spells. That one was four overs, which only went for three runs. On comes Chris Woakes, Cinderella finally making it to the ball. He goes past Azhar’s outside edge with a beauty. 33rd over: Pakistan 59-1 (Abid Ali 31, Azhar Ali 3) Azhar takes a comfy single. Bess bowls a few more nothing balls, and then he gets it right, going wider to Abid and beating him with the one that goes on with the arm. That’s Besser.32nd over: Pakistan 58-1 (Abid Ali 31, Azhar Ali 2) The ball has gone soft and the game has gone quiet. If there were any spectators in, they’d be nodding off. Another maiden from Archer and that’s drinks, after 14 of the allotted 52 overs. Pakistan are showing some grit England, while still well on top, are not making things happen fast enough.31st over: Pakistan 58-1 (Abid Ali 31, Azhar Ali 2) Abid pushes for two and flicks for a single. Bess is bowling too straight, the commentators reckon, and Joe Root seems to be saying the same thing with a signal from slip. If Root gets really irritated, he can always turn to his other off-spinner – himself.30th over: Pakistan 55-1 (Abid Ali 28, Azhar Ali 2) Jofra is mostly into his steady mode, bowling 88mph in the channel. Azhar, watchful, is leaving or blocking. The over ends with a snorter, touching 91mph, but Azhar is equal to it and jags his head out of the way. 29th over: Pakistan 55-1 (Abid Ali 28, Azhar Ali 2) A maiden from Bess, who’s made a decent start without threatening at all. Story of his Test career so far.28th over: Pakistan 55-1 (Abid Ali 28, Azhar Ali 2) Sore finger or not, Abid keeps Archer out and dabs a single to fine leg. Azhar gets off the mark with a tuck for two maybe his eye is still in from last night. “Afternoon, Tim,” says Phil Sawyer, picking up on my remark about the number of overs in this session (15:45). “52 is obviously also redolent of the controversial ‘New 52’ continuity introduced by DC comics several years ago to try to attract a new readership after decades of often bewilderingly complex plotlines and crossover events. Why yes, I’ve been single for quite a while now. Why do you ask?”27th over: Pakistan 52-1 (Abid Ali 27, Azhar Ali 0) It’s a double change as Anderson gives way to Dom Bess. The milestone-hunters may have to wait for another hour or so. I suspect Azhar is quite pleased to see some slow stuff so early in his innings. And Chris Woakes mildly displeased. 26th over: Pakistan 51-1 (Abid Ali 26, Azhar Ali 0) Broad goes off the field, presumably to check his bowling average for the summer (13.13). On comes Jofra Archer, whose average is rather different – 43.75. He deserves better, and begins with a maiden to Azhar, moving through the gears from 84mph to 88.25th over: Pakistan 51-1 (Abid Ali 26, Azhar Ali 0) With one opener gone and the other one bruised, Anderson tries to turn the screw by bringing in a leg slip for Abid Ali, but he stands firm and pushes into the covers for two. 24th over: Pakistan 49-1 (Abid Ali 24, Azhar Ali 0) So Azhar Ali comes out to bat for the third time in this match – he sent himself out to open last night, but wasn’t required and was able to change his tune this morning. Also, Pakistan maintain their long-standing policy of not having an opening partnership of 50 in England. The last was in 1996, apparently.It was umpire’s call, so Shan Masood was a little unlucky – but he did play no stroke to a ball that was either brushing off stump or missing it by a millimetre. That’s yet another wicket for Broad, his 29th in five Tests since being left out.He’s reviewing, but he played no stroke and it just brushed his pad, slap in front of off..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c693ac7f1ad4fa52ab8687220250942f38970ff0/0_16_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ab19dd3de1498baa3d5b422610f9c2c","title":"behind the scenes of sleepless in seattle musical kimberley walsh jay mcguiness","story":"The first new indoor musical since theatres closed in March is a version of the Meg Ryan romcom starring Kimberley Walsh. Will it persuade West End producers that the show can go on despite Covid? Kimberley Walsh and Jay McGuiness have spent the first part of their morning standing in a theatre foyer, waiting for their daily Covid-19 clearance before entering the auditorium for rehearsals.They are at Troubadour Wembley Park theatre in London, which is putting on the first socially distanced, indoor production of musical theatre since venues went dark in March and it is quite an operation. Cast and crew are tested for the virus every day and one part of the foyer has been turned into a makeshift testing centre. It is big, bare, with segregated “bubbles”: those waiting for tests on the right, those for results on the left, and a queue in the middle that leads to a team of nurses taking swabs.Walsh and McGuiness signed up for Sleepless, A Musical Romance long before lockdown and both felt apprehension on day one of their return, but all nerves have been dispelled by the Covid test, which returns results within the hour, alongside rigorous social distancing measures during rehearsals. “Even though things are different, I’m really comfortable with how organised it is,” says McGuiness. “It’s thrilling to be able to do this again,” adds Walsh.The show is based on the 1993 romcom Sleepless in Seattle, in which Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan teamed up to play star-crossed lovers. He a widower, Sam, with a young son, Jonah she a journalist, Annie, who listens in on a radio show in which he speaks about the death of his wife, which sparks a deluge of romantic propositions to him from single women across America.The actors, whose tests have just come in negative, are now at the back of the room, reflecting on putting on a romance without any physical contact. How does that work? “It’s a little bit as if the stars aligned for us,” says Walsh. “There’s no other movie I can think of, off the top of my head, where you genuinely believe that these two people are in love without any physical contact.”It is true that the romance has distance built into its storyline: Sam lives in Seattle while Annie is in Baltimore. One half of the cast never interacts with the other half and the stage here is so large that it would have led to a natural distance between actors, before it became a requirement.Just as their characters’ destinies are written in the stars, so there is a certain serendipity at work in staging this show at this time, they say. “It’s a sign!” says Walsh, while McGuiness rolls up his sleeve and shows me a tattoo with reads: “Every Moment”. “This is something else that freaks me out. I got this tattoo about five years ago and I was a week into rehearsals when I realised that ‘every moment’ is also a repeating phrase that the chorus and cast sing in this show.”But it may well have stayed ill-fated and unmade, had it not been for the herculean efforts of its producer, Michael Rose, to ensure the show goes on. An additional £60,000 to £70,000 has been spent on safeguards, including the reduction of audience capacity from 1,200 to 400, alongside one-way channels around the building, temperature checks, socially distanced seating plans with additional corridors in the auditorium, and Perspex screens along the bar. Creatively, its director, Morgan Young, has had to expunge one kiss and make sure that actors are not singing directly in front of each other.McGuiness says this way has its plus points from an actor’s point of view, too. “You have to use your voice in more exciting ways and your body language has to be much more animated. Just doing that is making me a more engaging actor.”While both Walsh and McGuiness are singers who have proved themselves as talented dancers (both competed in Strictly Come Dancing, McGuiness winning the glitterball in 2015 and Walsh a runner-up in 2012), there will be more singing than dancing in this show. Young, who previously worked on musical adaptions of Big (with McGuiness and Walsh) and Elf (with Walsh), said it became evident that “this wasn’t going to be a jazz-hands musical like Elf or Big. It’s more of a play with music.” But a splashy dance number does come at the end as a homage to 50s MGM films – and maybe a crowd-pleaser for Strictly fans, too.The music and lyrics by Robert Scott and Brendan Cull are new but it has the same, big band sound as the movie, complete with a live, 12-piece orchestra. It is still set in 1993 and Michael Burdette’s book stays faithful to the original screenplay, co-written by Nora Ephron, David S Ward and Jeff Arch. In fact, Sleepless is among a crop of musical revivals of 80s and 90s films such as Pretty Woman and Back to the Future. Are these finding refuge in nostalgia and is there an even greater desire for escape now, after the harsh realities of the pandemic? “It’s maybe about going back to a place where everything seems surmountable,” says McGuiness. However, Walsh thinks Sleepless is not just straightforward escapism. “The one thing that’s come out of this lockdown, if people didn’t already know it, is that family is everything. That is what this show is about, and also seeing love and affection on stage again. When Sam hugs his son, it’s going to kill people because so many feel they’re not even allowed to hug any more.”The musical’s other big, resonating theme is mortality and a family torn apart by the loss of a mother and wife, says Rose. “The show, at its heart, is how you move on from that. It’s about mending and healing the family, and having a happy ending.”• Sleepless, A Musical Romance plays from 25 August until 27 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60901d10061e7c75e0f6b090449312dcc1913d7e/0_54_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa6ff348dda3fe2e3c9a07c46b57932","title":"how much do you know about hybrid cars take our quiz","story":"From better batteries to regenerative braking, test your knowledge on these low-emission vehiclesHonda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned. On the path to this goal, they’ve released their first hybrid SUV, the CR-V, which features Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive (i-MMD) technology, enabling it to shuffle seamlessly between power sources.

If you’re one of the thousands who have saddled up for the first time during or post-lockdown, fear not – this isn’t your average commuting kit.I’m on my way to catch a train to Lyme Regis, the starting point of a coast-to-coast bikepacking trip (basically, cycling and carrying your camping kit) via four of England’s oldest trails. Known collectively as the Greater Ridgeway, the 362-mile mixed-terrain route has neolithic roots and is a favourite with hikers. Departing from Dorset’s dramatic Jurassic Coast, it meanders along the Wessex Ridgeway, the Ridgeway, the Icknield Way and Peddars Way to Holme-next-the-Sea in Norfolk. OS Maps suggest there’s a corresponding cycle route, with bike-friendly ersions along the way, making it a (seemingly) ideal route for a bikepacking expedition.Although not a new phenomenon, bikepacking is a growing trend. Panniers and racks are out the preferred option is now specialist luggage attached to the bike by Velcro and straps in a streamlined set up. “We’ve seen an increase in sales and new customers,” says George Huxford of bag maker Apidura, confirming that, as with the rest of the cycling industry, Covid has had a positive impact on business.While a hedge and a waterproof bivvy bag are the preferred choice of sleeping quarters for hardcore enthusiasts, most bikepackers opt for a bothy or official campsite. This makes bikepacking bang on trend, combining camping with a more enjoyable method of arriving at your pitch than sitting in a car or taking public transport. Cycling UK is a valuable resource, starting with advice on how to plan a simple weekend ride and camp miles from your doorstep.What I’m attempting is certainly on the more extreme side (minus the hedges). An experienced cyclist with a number of 100-mile sportives under my belt, I’m looking to cover the Greater Ridgeway in four days – those looking for a more leisurely ride could choose a shorter section over more time. Four hours in, though, I’m questioning the plans I’d made from the comfort of my front room.Boulder-packed descents, loose gravel climbs and impassable sections of path that look like they haven’t been walked on, let alone ridden, since the stone age mean it’s slow going over Dorset’s undulating countryside. When I find myself 42 miles short of my campsite in Sixpenny Handley with only three hours of daylight left, I need to find a more direct route. Unlike the druids before me, I have the benefit of switching to smooth asphalt roads.I arrive at Church Farm Caravan and Camping Park (pitches from £11.50) as the sun is setting, the tougher travails of the day softened by my catching a glimpse of the Cerne Giant while descending into the village of Cerne Abbas. Hastily assembling my tarp – a sheet that provides the shelter of a tent for a fraction of the weight – in the light of a friendly neighbour’s car headlights, I conclude that I need a plan B. My routes will have to change, allowing me to reach my remaining campsites in daylight, see some more sights and average 90 miles a day. I will cut out some of the winding, time-consuming tracks and trails in favour of the streets of Newbury, Cambridge and Thetford.New routes plotted, I find the riding improves immediately. I have time for a leisurely pit stop at The Bridge Inn, Upper Woodford, north of Salisbury, for coffee and a thick slice of carrot cake, and continue across the Salisbury Plain military training ground (there are various routes, but the clearly marked danger zones should, obviously, be avoided). The views across the hills are breathtaking and I even spy muntjac, hares and pheasants.This was the bikepacking experience I’d hoped for: Wilton Windmill appearing on the hillside from a quiet country lane waving to barges on the canalside paths of the Kennet and tackling the Ridgeway’s woodland trails with hearty helpings of calories every few hours. Reaching White Mark Farm campsite in Watlington (pitches from £8) ahead of schedule, I down a well-earned pint and devour a pizza in the Spire \u0026amp Spoke’s sunny beer garden before I tend to my tarp, queue for my socially distanced shower and bed down for the night as red kites circle above.A 5.30am wakeup call courtesy of that distinctive screech doesn’t dampen my spirits, and I’m soon back in the saddle – a 110-mile epic standing between me and the Kings Forest Caravan Park (adults only, pitches from £15) on the NorfolkSuffolk border. It starts with a rollercoaster ride past Chequers, and by lunchtime I’m grateful to have swapped the punchy peaks of the Chilterns for the pan-flat Fens. The addition of luggage makes the climbs rather harder (an off-piste ascent on Aldbury Common sticks in the mind), but the trick is to embrace bikepacking’s slower nature. The environment then takes on a new vividness, making for a much more rewarding experience.I rise with the sun, the scent of the pine forests lingering while I pack up for the last time. There’s just 50 miles to go and the waves of Norfolk’s coast are pulling me towards the end – even a ford, ripe for a spot of wild swimming in Castle Acre, can’t break their magnetic spell. I grin when I spy the Wash and don’t stop smiling until I reach the sandy beach of Holme-next-the-Sea.After a train ride from King’s Lynn, I’m back grinding through traffic on London’s streets. While my expedition may have got off to a choppy start, I’ve been bitten by the bikepacking bug. I’m plotting my next escape from the city before I even reach my front door.• Charlie Allenby is the author of Bike London (Spring 2021, ACC Art Books).

We can only guess what prevented him from returning to collect this treasure.”It is thought the area housed workshops at the time the treasure was hidden. The identity of the owner is a mystery.“It was amazing,” said Oz Cohen, one of the volunteers who found the treasure. “I dug in the ground and, when I excavated the soil, saw what looked like very thin leaves. When I looked again I saw these were gold coins. It was really exciting to find such a special and ancient treasure.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dfb59d46eecc4318f8c6ec887ab0776446400f9/0_182_5467_3281/master/5467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da91b247736b5b1d89018ea08ba3d85b","title":"coronavirus home test kits run out in england and scotland","story":"People told to travel long distances to test centres because daily allocation has been takenEngland and Scotland ran out of coronavirus home testing kits within hours on Monday, amid a backlog in laboratories.People were advised to travel long distances to test centres after being told that the daily allowance of home tests had run out.Callers to the NHS 119 number for Covid-19 were told: “We’re very sorry – the available allocation has already been issued at this time.”The reason behind the apparent shortage is unclear, but laboratories have been struggling to clear a backlog of tests since the end of July. The Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted for a comment.The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, announced on 28 April that his department was increasing the number of home testing kits available from 5,000 a day to 25,000 a day by the end of that week.Several people expressed their displeasure on social media after trying unsuccessfully to order a home test on Monday. One man said he had been told to travel to a testing site 36 miles away in Tiverton, south Devon, despite living closer to two testing sites.Another wrote to Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, saying there were no available slots at regional testing sites “within 100 miles of Glasgow” on Monday.The UK government does not release figures on how many home testing kits are posted out each day but the number of results recorded from them remains well below 25,000 a day.In the most recent week for which figures are available, an average of 16,000 results a day were recorded from home testing kits although the number has steadily increased over the past three months.Home test kits make up about one in four of all coronavirus tests carried out each week in the UK. The self-administered test, in which a swab must be inserted deep into the user’s throat and nose, is far more convenient for those who do not have access to a vehicle or live in remote locations far from the privately run testing sites.The time taken to produce results from coronavirus tests has risen sharply in recent weeks, owing to an IT failure and an increase in the number of tests being carried out.The government said the worsening turnaround times were due to an IT systems failure at one of the laboratories which resulted in a delay to the processing of results. It added that the increase of tests had also resulted in backlogs in some laboratories."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57f44d8045becfddd23925ed3864b3526a1e535e/0_239_4487_2691/master/4487.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=aece85ca45e8ef7bfec258f2e1f43323","title":"flordelis case brazil evangelical preacher politician accusations","story":"Singer-turned politician known as Flordelis was alleged ringleader of lurid family plot to kill husband, including poisoning himA gospel-singing Brazilian congresswoman has been accused of masterminding the “barbaric” murder of her preacher husband after at least six failed or aborted attempts to kill him with poison or in staged robberies.Anderson do Carmo was 42 when he was shot dead in June 2019 as he returned to the home he shared with the church crooner-turned-politician Flordelis dos Santos de Souza.The celebrity congresswoman, who congregants and fans call simply Flordelis, claimed her husband – with whom she had famously raised more than 50 children – had been slain by thieves.But allegations of a bizarre and lurid family plot to murder the evangelical preacher emerged on Monday as police arrested five of Flordelis’ children and one granddaughter for involvement in the crime.The 59-year-old lawmaker – who has made records for one of Brazil’s top gospel labels and was elected to congress in 2018 – could not be arrested because she enjoys parliamentary immunity.But investigators said they had no doubt Flordelis, who reportedly wept uncontrollably as police raided her home, was the ringleader.“The conclusion the investigation reached was this: that she planned this cowardly murder,” homicide chief Antônio Ricardo Lima Nunes told reporters as the singer’s handcuffed relatives were led away by heavily armed officers.“The motive was that she was unhappy with the way in which pastor Anderson lived his life and handled the family finances.”Do Carmo’s grisly murder – he was reportedly shot more than 30 times, predominantly in the groin and thighs – made nationwide headlines and has continued to do so since.Brazilian newspapers have published a succession of sensational allegations, including that the evangelical couple frequented a swingers club in west Rio where the singer was spotted in a state of inebriation. Flordelis denied those claims and has repeatedly denied involvement in her husband’s murder.“Let’s say we were surprised by today’s events,” her lawyer, Anderson Rollemberg, told the website UOL on Monday.Police, however, say they are sure she was the architect of his killing.Monday’s pre-dawn round-up was dubbed “Operation Luke 12” – a reference to the New Testament chapter in which Jesus tells his disciples: “There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.”Local reports alleged the conspiracy began in May 2018, when scheming relatives began secretly spiking pastor Anderson’s food with arsenic. It ended just over a year later, in the early hours of 16 June 2019, when the preacher’s body was riddled with bullets at the couple’s home in Niterói, a city near Rio.In the intervening period newspapers claimed there were at least five other failed or aborted attempts on his life, either by poisoning his food and drinks or staging robberies.One of the congresswoman’s daughters, Simone, was found to have trawled the internet for information on “cyanide in food” but claimed that was merely out of curiosity and to help a friend whose dog had a tumour.The O Globo newspaper reported that the pastor had actually discovered plans to murder him and threatened to bug all of the telephones in the family home, forcing the plotters to communicate with burner phones.Flordelis was born and raised in Jacarezinho, a sprawling Rio favela, where she began her singing career and met her future husband in the early 1990s. The couple went on to found a church together – the Ministry of Flordelis – and became famous for their huge family which was made up of 55 children, the majority adopted.Flordelis used her celebrity as a springboard into politics and was one of Rio’s most-voted federal lawmakers in 2018 with nearly 200,000 votes. “I’m going to fight for the family, for life and for women,” she vowed as she took office.“It was a barbaric, cowardly crime,” he told breakfast TV.Just a week earlier Flordelis had posted a photograph to Instagram – where she has nearly one million followers – in which she appeared straddling a camel with her late husband during a trip to Israel.“I still feel lost … part of me died with you … I feel a mixture of pain and disgust – what they did to you was so cruel,” she wrote before signing off: “I love you my Baby”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/604ccfbb0969026df6de425b5ab06d94809a9d8b/0_99_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5070b5d141bafbc3e8c47cd75a9b951","title":"six of the most promising treatments for covid 19 so far","story":"While a cure-all drug or therapy is a long way off, there have been some breakthroughsMany different drugs and therapies are being trialled and used on patients with Covid-19. There are some positive results, which may be beginning to bring the hospital death toll down, but there is still a long way to go towards something that will cure all comers. These are some of the most promising.This is the success story – a very cheap drug, in plentiful supply around the world – that has been shown to save lives. The low-dose steroid was responsible for the survival of one in eight patients on ventilators during the Oxford University-based Recovery trial. The results were announced in mid-June and the steroid is now standard treatment for the sickest patients. The data is reliable because it comes from the biggest randomised trial of Covid-19 treatments in the world, involving almost all hospitals in the UK. Dexamethasone has been around for 60 years, so is out of patent and cheap.The drug has been authorised for emergency use in the US, India and Singapore and approved in the European Union, Japan and Australia for use on people with severe symptoms. It’s an expensive drug, made by the US company Gilead Sciences, originally for hepatitis C, which it was ineffective on. It was then repurposed for Ebola. In Covid-19, it appears to shorten the length of an average hospital stay from 15 to 11 days, but it is not clear whether it has a dramatic effect on reducing deaths.A number of anti-inflammatory treatments are being tested to see if they can help. The coronavirus attacks the immune system, which leads to inflammation. Tocilizumab, an antibody normally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, is given by injection to block the inflammatory protein IL-6. Patients given the drug during the serious Covid-19 outbreak in Italy in March appeared to benefit and were less likely to end up on a ventilator or die. But the numbers were relatively small and this was an observational study, not a randomised trial set up to judge the outcomes of people with and without the drug. The Recovery trial is also investigating Tocilizumab.Scientists think people on medication because of their blood pressure would be well advised to stay on it. A paper from the University of East Anglia found that the risk of critical illness or death from Covid for people with high blood pressure was found to be significantly lower if they were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). That does not mean those drugs would be helpful to anyone with coronavirus infection who does not suffer from high blood pressure.A small study from scientists at Southampton University suggests that an inhaler containing the drug interferon beta, used to treat multiple sclerosis, could be effective. The three academics behind it, who formed a spin-off company for their product in 2004, became paper millionaires when they announced the results of their trial on Covid-19 patients in July. The trial involved just 101 patients at 9 hospitals. Those inhaling the drug left hospital sooner and were more likely to recover, but the data was not published in full. Larger trials are needed. “There is a big difference between encouraging early results and definitive evidence that transforms clinical practice,” commented Martin Landray, professor of medicine and epidemiology at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Recovery trial at the time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1199f987999f45a5f91b7e208570ac216edc2bb7/0_91_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=894c94cf10341f85cb1b83bc29c08cfd","title":"coronavirus live news send children to school uk pm urges france sees highest cases since may","story":"Man cleared of virus in April but has now tested positive again France to impose reciprocal quarantine on travellers returning from UK ‘Very low evidence’ for plasma therapy authorised by Trump — WHOA Florida judge temporarily blocked governor Ron DeSantis and top education officials from forcing public schools to reopen brick-and-mortar classrooms amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, ruling that the states order arbitrarily disregards safety.In his ruling, Leon County judge Charles Dodson said the mandate to reopen schools usurped local control from school districts in deciding for themselves whether it was safe for students, teachers and staffers to return.The Florida Education Association had sued the state after education commissioner Richard Corcoran issued an order earlier this summer mandating that schools reopen classrooms by 31 August or risk losing funding.The districts have no meaningful alternative, the judge wrote in his opinion.If an inidual school district chooses safety, that is, delaying the start of schools until it inidually determines it is safe to do so for its county, it risks losing state funding, even though every student is being taught, he ruled.As the outbreak began spreading across the state last spring, officials shuttered schools and teachers began providing instruction virtually to the states 2.9 million public school students.The Florida Education Association, which includes unions representing teachers and other school employees, expressed concerns about the ability of schools to keep children and teachers healthy.The ruling came as Florida’s coronavirus spread appeared to be waning, although it still outpaces the ability of contact tracers to contain outbreaks.With several key metrics on the decline, the governor says Dolphins and Hurricanes fans can attend football games again, under careful conditions.State-provided statistics showed 4,655 people being treated for Covid-19 in Florida hospitals on Monday, less than half of the peaks above 9,500 a month ago.A total of 72 new deaths were reported, bringing the seven day average down to 123, the lowest rate in a month. Average daily increases in cases over the past week have declined to a level not seen since late June.Apple plans to start reopening US retail stores that have been closed over the past several weeks due a resurgence in Covid-19 cases, Bloomberg News has reported.The company will open a small number of stores as soon as the end of August with most stores operating on an appointment-only basis for the immediate future, the report said. An Amman summit between Jordan, Iraq and Egypt will go ahead on Tuesday with extra precautions, officials said, after Iraq’s telecommunications minister tested positive for Covid-19.Minister Arkan al-Shaybani and fellow Iraqi officials were tested upon landing in Amman on Friday and the entire delegation was placed in confinement after the minister tested positive, according to a statement by Jordan’s information minister Amjad al-Adayla.“This required implementing medical procedures put in place to protect the health of our guest while he is in the kingdom,” Adayla said in comments reported by Jordan’s official Petra news agency.Shaybani was travelling to Amman for a tripartite summit on Tuesday between the leaders of Iraq, Jordan and Egypt to discuss trade, telecommunications and oil.The one-day meeting will bring King Abdullah II of Jordan and Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi together with Iraqi prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi for the first time.The gathering comes just days after Kadhemi’s return from Washington, which has long urged its allies in the region to band together against Iranian influence.Jordan, Egypt and Iraq have held similar meetings in the past two years, mostly focused on infrastructure and coordinating the fight against jihadists.“The summit will still take place on Tuesday but the size of the delegations and the meeting times will be limited as a precautionary measure,” Kadhemi’s spokesman, Ahmad Mullal Talal, told AFP.Iraq’s coronavirus caseload neared 208,000, with deaths at nearly 6,500 - making it one of the hardest-hit countries in the Middle East.On Monday, the deputy speaker of Iraq’s parliament Hassan al-Kaabi also announced he had tested positive. Between lawmakers and their staff, there are more than 60 cases in parliament.The virus claimed the life of one Iraqi parliamentarian last month and a presidential adviser last week.The World Health Organization has warned that Iraq’s cases are “exponentially rising to an alarming and worrying level, suggesting a major health crisis soon”.Brussels is one of the European regions recording the fastest-growing surge of new coronavirus cases in recent weeks, state virologist Marc Van Ranst has said.Brussels registered 997 new infections from 7-14 August, one of the fastest weekly spikes across Europe, according to data shared by Van Ranst on Twitter.“Brussels, together with large parts of Spain and Moldova, is in the top 10 regions with the largest Covid19 increase this week,” Van Ranst said. “The politicians of the Brussels-Capital Region should consider how they can either better enforce or tighten up the corona measures.”Authorities have been focusing on clusters in Antwerp, The Brussels Times reports, but Van Ranst suggested that measures adopted by local authorities have helped slow down the spread there. The latest protective measures in Brussels mean it is now mandatory to wear a face mask in public, but officials have stopped short of stricter measures. Germany has issued a travel warning for Paris and the French Cote d’Azur region due to rising coronavirus infections there, the foreign ministry in Berlin has said.The foreign ministry said it was warning against unnecessary tourist trips to the Île-de-France region, which includes the French capital, and the southern region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, which includes Marseille and Nice, due to the high number of infections. UEFA has ruled that Slovan Bratislava and FC Pristina have forfeited European qualifying matches called off after coronavirus outbreaks at the clubs.Both were judged to have lost 3-0 and their opponents awarded places in the next round.The Slovaks were scheduled to play Klaksvikar Itrottarfelag (KI) in the Faroe Islands, originally on 19 August and then on 21 August, in the first qualifying round, but the entire Bratislava team was quarantined by local authorities after two consecutive positive tests in two days for one of Slovan’s players.Pristina, from Kosovo, were due to face Lincoln Red Imps in Gibraltar on 18 August in a Europa League preliminary round.Their players tested negative before leaving Kosovo but were tested again when they arrived in Gibraltar and several members of the delegation showed positive and the entire team was quarantined.The match was postponed from on 18 August until 22 August and the club was allowed to bring in additional players. Unfortunately, eight players among the reinforcements tested positive and the match cancelled.In the next qualifying round, KI will face Swiss team Young Boys and Red Imps will play Union Titus Petange from Luxembourg.Zoom, the video conferencing app that has proved very popular with people working from home during the coronavirus pandemic, has suffered a partial failure that left thousands of people in the US, UK and across the world unable to connect to work meetings or classes.The California-based company behind the app apologised to customers and said it was working hard to fix the problem that had left users “unable to start and join Zoom meetings and webinars”.“We are in the process of deploying a fix across our cloud. Service has been restored already for some users. We are continuing to roll this out to complete the fix for any users still impacted,” Zoom Video Communications said on its website on Monday.The number of new, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in France has risen by 1,955 compared to the previous day, although the increase in new cases was less than in previous days.The French health ministry said the number of deaths from Covid-19 had risen by 15 from the previous day to stand at 30,528 casualties, while the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases stands at 244,854.France has the seventh-highest Covid-19 death toll in the world, and the government is monitoring the figures closely to see if any new restrictions or lockdowns are needed to curb the spread of the virus.“The circulation of the virus is progressing markedly, and is at its most intense among young adults,” the ministry said in a statement.The number of new cases was less than the 4,897 new cases registered on 23 August, although 22 new clusters had been discovered in the last 24 hours, added the ministry.Hi everyone, this is Jessica Murray taking over the blog for the next few hours.

Bolt does not confirm if that is true, but says took a test on Saturday and is isolating while he waits for the “protocol” on quarantining from the Ministry of Health.On Friday Bolt attended his surprise birthday, along with celebrities including Manchester City footballer Raheem Sterling and Bayern Leverkusen winger, Leon Bailey.In his Twitter video, Bolt said he would be contacting all his friends and telling them to quarantine “just to be safe”.Here is the main quote — make of it what you will: I am trying to be responsible so I am going to stay in and stay here for my friends. And also, having no symptoms, I am going to quarantine myself and wait on the confirmation to see what is the protocol and how I should go about quarantining myself, from the Ministry of Health. So until then I will talk to all my friends and tell them that if they have come into contact with me they should quarantine by themselves and just take it easy and just to let people know, be safe out there.Usain Bolt has responded to media claims that he has tested positive for Covid-19. He said he has no symptoms but is self isolating and did a test on Saturday, the day after his 34th birthday. Watch this video for yourself and decide what he is saying. It’s not entirely clear whether he has Covid or not.A Hong Kong man who recovered from Covid-19 was infected again four-and-a-half months later in the first documented instance of human re-infection, researchers at the University of Hong Kong said on Monday.The findings indicate the disease, which has killed more than 800,000 people worldwide, will continue to spread amongst the global population despite herd immunity, they said.The 33-year-old male was cleared of Covid-19 and discharged from a hospital in April, but tested positive again after returning from Spain via Britain on 15 August.The patient had appeared to be previously healthy, researchers said in the paper, which was accepted by the international medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.He was found to have contracted a different coronavirus strain from the one he had previously contracted and remained asymptomatic for the second infection.The World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said on Monday there was no need to jump to any conclusions in response to the Hong Kong case.Instances of people discharged from hospitals and testing positive again for Covid-19 infection have been reported in mainland China.However, in those cases it was not clear whether they had contracted the virus again after full recovery – as happened to the Hong Kong patient – or still had the virus in their body from the initial infection.One explanation was that the virus still existed in the lungs of patients but was not detected in samples taken from upper parts of the respiratory tract, he said. Other possible causes were low sensitivity of tests and weak immunity that could lead to persistent positive results, he added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4333940.1598013679!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoStaggering\u0026rsquo study indicates sea level rises could reach a metre by the end of the centuryOne Change: We need to rethink the value we place on the natural environmentActivist says ongoing denial about scale of crisis contrasts with urgency of Covid fight"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337823.1598293373!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"clifden golf dinner former junior minister %C3%A1ine brady apologises for attendance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer junior minister Aine Brady is chief executive of Third Age, the organisation that supports older people in Ireland. File photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Former junior minister Áine Brady has apologised for attending the Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in Clifden, Co Galway last week, describing it as a distraction from the work of her charity. Ms Brady is chief executive of Third Age, the organisation that supports older people in Ireland. She became the latest of the more than 80 guests at the controversial event to publicly acknowledge her error and apologise. The dinner was held by the society after it hosted two days of golf at the nearby Connemara Golf Course in Ballyconneely, Co Galway. The event was attended by several TDs and senators, along with former TDs and senators.Ms Brady had accompanied her husband Gerry, who had played in the golf tournament, to the function in Clifden.Third Age did not immediately supply a comment from Ms Brady when contacted but in a statement reported by the Leinster Leader, she said she wished to sincerely apologise. “I am disappointed that my actions may have distracted from the tremendous work that the organisation does, and I will re-double my efforts to ensure that these programmes will continue to deliver positive outcomes for older people and communities in Ireland,” she said. “I unreservedly apologise and deeply regret my attendance at last week’s event.”Ms Brady lost her Kildare North seat in the 2011 general election, having represented the constituency as a Fianna Fail TD since 2007.She became minister of state with responsibility for older people in April 2009 and was appointed head of Third Age 2013. On Monday morning, another former TD, Dr Michael Harty also apologised for his attendance. Media interviews with those at the dinner have been rare but Dr Harty told his local station Clare FM that he had made an error of judgment and did not initially suspect there was anything wrong with the event. He said he was not aware of the changes to Covid guidelines made the day before which further limited indoor gatherings. “I turned off completely in relation to what was going on in the outside world for two days,” he said. “I have been working hard in relation to this pandemic for the past six months since it started at the beginning of February and ya, I let my guard down.”He said he should have known something was amiss when he walked into the room and used his common sense but he assumed the dinner was in compliance with the rules. He explained he was not a member of the “tight knit” committee group who organised the meal and that he “certainly would have seen the dangers” if he had been. “I walked into a trap basically. I walked into a room which looked fine the tables were distanced. I didn’t see any difficulty.”The former Clare independent TD and GP, said he intended to learn from his mistakes which have cost him personally and professionally. “I acknowledge the hurt and distress that it has caused and has undermined the commitment and sacrifice that everyone has been making during this pandemic,” he said.

Video: RTE\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tActing Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn during a press briefing at Government Buildings in Dublin. Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireThe State’s public health emergency team has issued a “note of caution” about rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in Dublin where people should take “extra care” to prevent spreading the virus.There were a further 147 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team, including 73 in Dublin. No further deaths were reported. This brings total confirmed cases to 28,116 with the death toll from the virus remaining at 1,777. Acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn told a press briefing that there was not a major problem with rising cases in Dublin over the last number of days but that it was “something that we are watching closely.”“It is not an alarm it is simply a note of caution for people to take care and take all the basic measures,” he said, referring to the long-standing public health measures that people should follow and last week’s specific guidance to avoid house parties and other larger gatherings.The increased cases in Dublin were spread across the county but the number of infections were “slightly higher” in Dublin West, Dublin North West and Dublin North Central, he said. “Unlike what we saw in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, there isn’t one or two defined clusters guiding this in Dublin. It is spread out across areas, across settings, across workplaces and with a significant proportion of community transmission,” he said. One in three Dublin cases are from community transmission, which is higher than one-in-five national average. Some 34 of the 73 Dublin cases are close contacts of other Covid-19 cases.There was “no suggestion” that a county lockdown or any further restrictions were needed in Dublin and that if people followed guidance, the benefits would be seen next week, said Dr Glynn. Countrywide, there were 27 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in hospitals, including six in critical care units, and that this was up from 17 last Thursday. “We do need to monitor that very closely,” said Dr Glynn.He challenged claims from some commentators that the pandemic was now a “case-demic”, that public health officials should “stop worrying” and that “the virus has weakened.” “That is simply not the case,” he said. If cases kept rising, “it will only be a matter of time before it spreads into other groups,” he said. Dr Mary Favier, president of the Irish College of General Practitioners, acknowledged the anxiety amongst parents with schools reopening this week.She said parents should not worry about children who “have a runny nose for every single day of winter” but should “start to pay attention” when children have a high temperature, a cough or other respiratory symptoms and should keep them home for 48 hours until symptoms settle.Dr Glynn said it “won’t be a surprise” if there are cases among schoolchildren but the challenge was “to response to that appropriately and listen to the appropriate information sources.”There were 84 children under the age of 14 last week who tested positive for Covid-19 and overall children under 14 accounted for less than three per cent of cases.“The vast, vast majority who have Covid have very mild, if any symptoms,” he said. “If we can suppress this and keep this low in our community, we can protect our children and protect our education system.”Dr Glynn said he didn’t believe that it was possible to pursue a strategy to eliminate Covid-19 completely and that Nphet’s strategy was to “keep the cases as low as possible” and to protect education, vulnerable people and healthcare. Dr Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said that alternative testing methods were being evaluated for children, including saliva testing.Some 57,670 Covid-19 tests were conducted last week with a 1.3 per cent positivity rate.There were two new Covid-19 outbreaks reported at direct provision centres, in Bray and in Limerick and eight new cases spread over all eight outbreaks in these centres. Separately, another 10 cases of Covid-19 have been reported across Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours.There have been no more deaths.The first pupils have returned to schools across Northern Ireland since the coronavirus lockdown started in March. Some parents have expressed concerns while teachers’ unions say educators had not been given enough time to respond to rules issued earlier this month. Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride has insisted it is safe to return. However three schools did not reopen following the detection of Covid-19 cases.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"147 new cases but no further deaths reported in the StateFormer chief justice Susan Denham has been asked to begin work immediately on the reviewPolice Federation call for urgent review of sentencing lawsTerrorism charges brought after 10 people are arrested under Operation ArbaciaMany parents commenting on the NPIC\u0026rsquos Facebook post criticise it for being alarmist\u0026lsquoStaggering\u0026rsquo study indicates sea level rises could reach a metre by the end of the centuryLisa McGowan seeks identification of people she claims are defaming and stalking her onlineFirm alleged to have been besieged in an occupation by members of the INLAEU commissioner has faced calls to resign after attending event with over 80 guests\u0026lsquoGo home , hug and kiss your loved ones, tell them how much they mean to you,\u0026rsquo Geraldine Mullan saysDara Calleary resigns as deputy leader of Fianna F\u0026aacuteil, Taoiseach confirmsWoman (26) and Teenager (17) die following road accidents on Sunday eveningPressure building on Hogan to step down from EU role since last weekOrange rainfall warning and yellow wind warning in place for TuesdayMan arrested and being detained after incident in ClontarfTaoiseach confirms Calleary has also resigned as Fianna F\u0026aacuteil deputy leaderIt is understood the child (9) was swept out to sea on an inflatable deviceStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337727.1598288008!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hand sanitiser q a should send my child to school with a bottle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChris Donnelly, principal of St John The Baptist Primary School in West Belfast uses sanitiser on pupils’ hands, as schools in Northern Ireland reopen on Monday. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA What’s this I read about the dangers of hand sanitiser, I thought it was a good thing?Oh, it is a good thing and one of the key – one of the only, truth be told – weapons we have in the fight against Covid-19. However, concerns have been expressed in recent days about the alcohol content and presentation of some products particularly when in the hands of young children heading off to school for the first time in six months.Great, another thing to worry about. Who has expressed this concern?The National Poisons Information Centre (NPIC) based in Beaumont Hospital. In a Facebook post over the weekend it asked a simple question. “Would you send your child to school with a naggin of vodka?” Of course not, why would they even as that?Because, as the NPIC points out, a 100ml bottle of 80 per cent alcohol hand sanitiser has the same amount of alcohol as a 200ml bottle of 40 per cent vodka.Yes the NPIC warns that even small amounts of hand sanitiser if consumed can lead to INTOXICATION (their caps). The social media post also points out that some hand-sanitiser bottles look like water bottles and may be mistaken for a drink and it expresses concern that “toy-like novelty hand-sanitiser containers may appear attractive to children and their contents easily ingested.”Are they suggesting the kids will drink the stuff? Have they ever tasted it? It is vile tasting all right but the NPIC is still erring on the side of caution. It is true that consumption of it would pose a risk for a young child even if it is not one, perhaps, that many people will have considered until now. The Department of Education has also made it clear that young children should not have independent use of containers of alcohol hand sanitiser.How did the warning go down online?Not entirely well. Many parents posting on the NPIC’s Facebook post criticising it for being alarmist and are seeking actual evidence that children have been ingesting hand sanitiser and asking whether it has been a previously documented problem. Others said it was the parents’ responsibility to teach their children not drink their hand sanitiser. But my school is asking us to send hand sanitiser in with my child?Many schools are doing that, even those who are saying they have sufficient stocks in school dispensing units.So, what should I do?Talk to your school and talk to your child. Obviously sending a very young child to school with a potentially toxic or liquid in an attractive container in the school bag alongside their lunchbox is probably not a good idea, particularly if the hand sanitiser is liquid and the bottle easily opened. But there is probably less risk if the hand sanitiser is a thick gel or foam and comes in a bottle that could in absolutely no way be confused with a drink. Make sure to avoid any gels that smell nice and this is one instance when the more toxic smelling and tasting the product is, the better.

The initial impact of Brexit was two price hikes of 10 per cent each, both caused by a fall in the sterling to euro exchange rate.But the impact on sales was virtually zero and a World Trade Organisation tariff of 7 per cent, which will apply to Silverhill goods entering the UK without a UKEU trade deal, doesn’t faze the company’s head of sales, Barry Cullen.“It’s not a major price difference,” he says. “We are a premium product. We are about twice as expensive as our competitors, so we’re not price sensitive.”Two years ago when the implications of Brexit were sinking in, the company leased temporary warehouse space near Manchester where 100 pallets, each holding 420 frozen ducks, could be stored, thus ensuring UK customers would continue to be supplied if ports became jammed. The warehouse option can be revived after January, if needs be.The Silverhill breed, which is half Aylesbury, half Peking, is popular in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East so as regards exporting to the rest of the world, the company long ago abandoned the UK land bridge and exports now, via Dublin Port, to Cherbourg and Rotterdam.Silverhill duck has become a far-travelled delicacy. In Singapore, what is marketed as “London Fat Duck” began life as an egg in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone. It was hatched in Slieve Bragan, Co Monaghan and reared for 42 days on farms in Monaghan and Tyrone before being processed in Emyvale – all by a workforce of about 250.Cullen believes their UK customers, who are overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese enterprises, are well used to importing from outside the EU and the prospect of WTO tariffs and regulations doesn’t worry them. “They’re all fine about it,” he says.Longer term, Cullen sees Irish-based businesses turning away from the UK.Then there’s the prospect of increasing Silverhill’s burgeoning trade with the Far East.“Indonesia,” he says excitedly, “the population’s 260 million and you think it’s a poor country but you take the top one per cent. . . you start thinking in terms of selling pallets of duck and end up thinking of container loads.”PortwestLike Silverhill, warehousing became a solution for another major exporter, Portwest, the €180 million turnover, outdoor leisure and work clothing company which is based in Westport, Co Mayo and employs 4,500 people worldwide.“Before Brexit we had one main distribution warehouse in the UK, with 250 staff, serving every country in the EU,” says Portwest managing director Harry Hughes. “After Theresa May announced that the UK were leaving the customs union, we decided to open a second distribution warehouse in Poland and were ready when the first deadline passed.”The Polish warehouse has 150 staff and serves all of Portwest’s EU customers. The UK warehouse, with 100 fewer staff, serves UK and Portwest’s non-EU customers – England’s loss was Poland’s gain.“We are now Brexit-proof from issues associated with customs and borders,” says Hughes. “No company will be exempt from the possible political or commercial fallout.”CombiLiftCombiLift is another Monaghan-based company with a global reach that has also had to react to the potential worst-case scenario in January.The company, a hugely successful maker of forklift trucks, has grown over 22 years into a €300 million turnover enterprise employing 650 people.Most of the staff work at an enormous assembly plant that is 11 acres under roof and sits on a 100 acre site at the edge of Monaghan town. Four production lines, now working two at a time in staggered shifts because of Covid-19 distancing restrictions, crank out customised forklifts trucks.Their multi-directional wheel and steering system gives them extra manoeuvrability, allowing them operate in very confined spaces. This allows CombiLift to market itself as a space saver, selling customers the notion that their existing warehouse has greater capacity, if storage aisles are reconfigured and made narrower, thereby allowing for more shelving.While the company’s two largest markets, accounting for half of output, are the UK and US, it also exports to more than 80 countries throughout Europe and the Americas, as well as to Asia, Africa and Australia.The company’s single most significant response to Brexit was to obtain from Revenue the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), a process that took 10 months and culminated in the issuing of a prized AEO certificate in June 2019.What the status means in effect is that the CombiLift plant in Monaghan becomes a customs and excise frontline, rather than the frontline being at the port through which exports flow. On a day-to-day basis, this means the plant operates like a bonded warehouse so when finished products or spare parts reach a port, they pass through the green channel, without delay and unchecked.“You become a trusted partner with Revenue and as long as you do everything properly, there is no reason for them to check what you do.”That said, the plant can be subject to inspection at any time and the perimeter of the site is laser beam protected. CCTV is everywhere.CombiLift has an articulated truck or container leaving the Monaghan plant every hour of every day. The company also takes in 40 truck-loads of imported parts, the company’s manufacturing raw materials.Whatever way Brexit pans out in January, CombiLift will be able to deliver spare parts to UK customers overnight.So McVicar hasn’t given up on the UK.“Whatever happens in Brexit is not going to stop us investing there, for multiple reasons,” he says. “The UK clients are still going to need forklift trucks to move goods around. In fact, their demand for warehousing space is going to be at a higher premium because the minute a company comes out of that European block, they’ll want to want to make sure they’ve goods on their island.“UK companies are going to be stocking higher levels of components and food to deal with border scenarios and where our products come into value is, even though we make forklift trucks, we are actually in the business of selling warehouse space. We sell forklift trucks that save warehouse space and as the demand for warehousing increases, there’s more demand for our product.“So even post-Brexit, whether there’s no deal or there is a deal, we’re still going to invest in the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Emmanuel DunandAFP via Getty ImagesIf Phil Hogan thought he could leave the drama and consternation behind him when he flew out of Dublin Airport on Saturday morning for Brussels, he was wrong.Only one story is dominating in the Brussels bubble, and it’s the fallout from the fateful golf soirée in Clifden. The Hogan affair has topped one of the busiest August periods most can remember in a city that usually shuts down for the month, consuming the day’s news cycle and the European Commission’s press conference.Mr Hogan is one of the highest-profile commissioners, at the helm of the powerful trade portfolio which shapes policy around the world through the force of the European Union’s economic and regulatory might.National political stories do not always break through in Brussels, where they are often drowned out by international priorities and the clamour of the affairs of 27 different member states.But the coronavirus pandemic is not a national story. It’s an issue that the European Commission has been consumed with addressing since February. A top official accused of breaking rules designed to curb the pandemic would have been a major story wherever it broke. The commission itself designed and launched an online service – Reopen EU – to help citizens know and follow local rules wherever they are travelling.Whatever happens next Mr Hogan’s reputation as a canny operator has suffered major damage. Not least because he would have a better chance at weathering this scandal were it not for a series of traps he set for himself.His team initially insisted he had travelled directly from Kilkenny to Galway. It subsequently emerged that he had been in and out of Kildare en route despite local lockdown restrictions, as he was stopped by gardaí there for using his mobile phone while driving.This development made a spoofer of the European Commission press office, which had repeated Hogan’s claim about travelling “directly” to the golf event. And the manner of it – coming to light due to a driving infraction, which he had not disclosed – left a decidedly bad taste in the mouth.The commission’s spokeswoman Dana Spinant took a noticeably cool tone towards Mr Hogan as she revealed that his boss, commission president Ursula von der Leyen, had received an account from him of his movements, but had sought further clarifications.“She’s in the process of gathering facts and this is where we stand,” Ms Spinant said. “It is important of course for the president that rules are respected in respect to coronavirus rules, and quarantine regulations and recommendations in particular.”Commissioners are hard to dislodge. Only one has been sacked in the past: Malta’s John Dalli, due to allegations that the tobacco industry tried to bribe him to change proposed legislation in 2012.There are some who argue that commissioners should be above the fray, as once they are in place they represent the whole citizenry of the bloc, and to give the executive the necessary stability to persevere regardless of whatever intrigue might seize Budapest or Rome.Logistical headacheReplacing commissioners is also a logistical headache. Appointments need to be approved by the European Parliament following hearings. The commission cabinet is a careful balance of geography, gender and political persuasion: a replacement would have to come from the Fine Gael pool to avoid triggering a wider reshuffle.It would be a stretch for Ireland to retain the beefy trade portfolio. Dr von der Leyen might be more likely to move an existing commissioner into it, giving Ireland whatever vacancy emerges.Unfortunately for Mr Hogan all of this has already been thought through, due to a move that is now transpiring to be a serious error.In June he floated himself as a potential candidate to be the next director-general of the World Trade Organisation.The bid fell flat. Allies who had supported him to become trade commissioner were puzzled and alienated, wondering why they had thrown their weight behind him, only for Mr Hogan to eye another prize just six months in.Campaigning would have required him to step back from his job for months at a time when the pandemic poses unprecedented challenges to the global system, a trade war between the United States and China was rumbling on and talks about the future trade relationship with Britain near their denouement.This makes it difficult for him to make what would be his strongest argument now – that he is indispensable – given that he himself was willing to walk off the job.And it seriously ticked off his boss, Dr von der Leyen, who now holds his fate in her hands.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337457.1598271925!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"von der leyen requests clarifications after hogan hands over dossier on golf dinner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU Commissioner Phil Hogan who has been asked for more information by  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Photograph: Bloomberg European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has asked for further clarification from Ireland’s Commissioner Phil Hogan after receiving a dossier describing his movements in the country because “details count” a spokeswoman has said.Mr Hogan is under pressure after it emerged that initial statements by his spokesman claiming he travelled “directly” from Co Kilkenny to the controversial golf event in Co Galway were incorrect.Mr Hogan’s team have since admitted he returned to Co Kildare on his way to the golf event, to collect items from his residence at the K-Club, and was stopped by gardaí in the county for using his mobile phone while driving.A spokesman for the European Commission had on Friday also repeated that Mr Hogan travelled to Co Galway “directly”.“This is a matter that requires careful assessment on our side. This is a matter where details count. Therefore the president has requested Commission Hogan to provide a full report covering the matters,” European Commission spokeswoman Dana Spinant said.“The President has received such a report from Commissioner Hogan last night. She is now looking at it. Details are important as I said. The President has requested further clarifications because details are important and she wishes to have them.”Trade portfolioMs von der Leyen has the power to dismiss Mr Hogan, who is in charge of the vital trade portfolio at a time of crucial sensitivity amid a trade war between the United States and China and with time running out to clinch agreement with Britain about its future trade relations with the EU following Brexit.Ms Spinant said that so far the Commission’s work on trade had been able to continue, and that it was vital that this remained the case.“It’s important to ensure that nothing distracts the Commission from its very important work, in particular at these times when we need to deal with a serious crisis provoked by the Coronavirus, ” the spokeswoman said.Mr Hogan had presented a dossier to Ms von der Leyen last night and was then subsequently asked for more detail.The Commission spokeswoman indicated she expected Mr Hogan, who has yet to appear in public to take questions from journalists, would make a public appearance.“We feel for the people of Ireland who like many other people and communities in the European Union over the past months had to go through difficult times to comply with strict regulations to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus. Many have lost loved ones, many have been ill and others have suffered from the restrictions,” Ms Spinant said.“So this is why it is important that rules are respected. This is a matter not just on respecting the rules but this is also a matter of public health. There are legal aspects involved and there are moral aspects involved as well.”It is understood Mr Hogan’s dossier has not yet been provided to senior members of the Irish Government.The Government will now await Ms von der Leyen’s judgment on the report and any additional information from Mr Hogan.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has not spoken to Ms von der Leyen about Mr Hogan’s future, indicating that, if she is satisfied with the former Fine Gael minister’s explanations, the Government will not seek his removal as commissioner.Officials in Dublin and Brussels said she is expected to make a decision about Mr Hogan’s future after considering his account.Ms von der Leyen, who is said by her spokesman to be “following the situation closely”, requested the detailed report from Mr Hogan about his attendance at the dinner and travel in Ireland prior to the event after new revelations emerged.Senior politiciansMr Hogan was one of more than 80 people, including a number of senior politicians and a member of the judiciary, who attend the dinner in Clifden, Co Galway last Wednesday, in apparent contravention of Covid-19 restrictions.On Monday Martin said a statement he issued on Saturday evening with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar calling for Mr Hogan to consider his position was released after emerged that he had been stopped by gardaí, Micheál Martin said on Friday.Mr Martin said on Monday he was very angry over the dinner in Galway and said it should not have happened.Mr Martin also confirmed that Dara Calleary, who resigned as Minister for Agriculture on Friday, has also resigned as deputy leader of Fianna Fáil.Yesterday Mr Hogan’s spokesman confirmed he went from Kilkenny to the K-Club on his way to Clifden last week to collect personal belongings and “essential” work papers.Mr Hogan’s spokesman said he was cautioned and he did not receive penalty points.On Saturday evening, following consultations with the Green Party leader, Eamon Ryan, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar called for Mr Hogan to “consider his position”.Uncompromising noteMr Varadkar sounded a less uncompromising note on Sunday when he said Mr Hogan’s second - and more contrite - apology “definitely helps”.However, Mr Varadkar said he needed to provide further explanations, especially about whether he may have broken the terms of the local lockdown in Co Kildare, where he has a residence at the K-Club golf resort.“He needs to answer any questions that people have,” Mr Varadkar said. “That’s not just in relation to the dinner, it’s also any questions that might arise from his movements within the country and his movements in and out of Co Kildare.”If Mr Hogan is unable to do this, “then he needs to consider his position”.Meanwhile, gardaí have been in contact with staff at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, where the Oireachtas Golf Society function was held.The Garda investigation into the gathering is focused on how the event was organised. Under current Covid-19 regulations, organising a large event is not permitted. The ban or organising an event is a penal provision meaning any proven breach is a criminal offence, though attending an event is not prohibited by law."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Locals and police search the debris after five-storey structure crumbles in MahadResearchers say \u0026lsquoapparently young and healthy\u0026rsquo patient had second Covid-19 episodeLuon Sovath, who has spent decades fighting for human rights, was the victim of a vicious smear campaign this summerFears that country teetering on edge of major outbreak supported by data on rise in daily casesWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337848.1598294416!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus first confirmed case of reinfection reported in hong kong","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA swab sample during testing for possible Covid-19 infection. File photograph: Andreas RentzGetty ImagesThe first lab-confirmed case of someone being reinfected with Covid-19 has been reported by researchers in Hong Kong. The findings could have significant implications for the development of vaccines for the disease and for what is known about natural immunity against the novel coronavirus.Researchers at the University of Hong Kong’s (HKU) department of microbiology said that an “apparently young and healthy patient had a second episode of Covid-19 infection which was diagnosed 4.5 months after the first episode”.They added that the case illustrates reinfection can occur a few months after recovery from the first infection.The man had no symptoms – was asymptomatic – during the second infection, which was picked up by screening tests on returning passengers at Hong Kong airport.Genetic sequencing of the virus showed he was infected twice by different strains of Covid-19, the researchers said.They added that the findings suggest Sars-CoV-2 may persist in the global human population, as is the case for other, common-cold-associated human coronaviruses, even if patients have acquired immunity via natural infection.Therefore, people with previous Covid-19 infection should comply with control measures like wearing face coverings and social distancing.‘Not lifelong’One of the researchers, Dr Kelvin Kai-Wang To, clinical associate professor at the department of microbiology, which is part of the Li Ka Shing faculty of medicine, said: “This case shows that patients recovered from Covid-19 can get reinfected.“Therefore, the immunity against Covid-19 is not lifelong.”In a statement the university said: “Since the immunity can be short lasting after natural infection, vaccination should also be considered for those with one episode of infection.”The researchers’ study has been accepted by medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, but the full research is yet to be published.However, experts in the UK say it is too early to say what the single case may mean on a global scale.Brendan Wren, professor of microbial pathogenesis at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “The first reported case of a potential reinfection with Sars-CoV-2 needs to be taken into context.“It appears that the young and healthy adult has been reinfected with a slight Sars-CoV-2 variant from the initial infection three months previously.“It is to be expected that the virus will naturally mutate over time. This is a very rare example of reinfection and it should not negate the global drive to develop Covid-19 vaccines.”Stronger evidenceDr Jeffrey Barrett, senior scientific consultant for the Covid-19 Genome Project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “This is certainly stronger evidence of reinfection than some of the previous reports because it uses the genome sequence of the virus to separate the two infections.“It seems much more likely that this patient has two distinct infections than a single infection followed by a relapse (due to the number of genetic differences between the two sequences).”But he added that it is “very hard” to make any strong inference from a single observation, and that seeing one case of reinfection is not that surprising.“This may be very rare, and it may be that second infections, when they do occur, are not serious,” said Dr Barrett.“And in a place like Hong Kong, where they have very strong facilities they can do that in, and in fact they have done, I understand there is a 24 nucleotide difference between the first virus and second virus.“What I think is really important is that we put this into context. There has been more than 24 million cases reported to date and we need to look at something like this on a population level.”She added: “But I don’t want people to be afraid, we need to ensure that people understand that when they are infected, even if they have a mild infection, they do develop an immune response.“In this particular case, it’s very important that we look, and I haven’t read the studies so I don’t have an answer to this yet, to see if this inidual developed a neutralising antibody response, which is what will protect from reinfection.” – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The request stems from Mr Hogan’s attendance at the Oireachtas Golf Society’s dinner in Clifden last week. Here we look at Covid-19 rules and how they apply to senior European politicians.Are top politicians exempt from Coronavirus rules?EU Commissioners have no special pan-European exemptions from local rules. Indeed the European Commission repeatedly stresses the importance of informing oneself about the local rules in place, and the personal responsibility of adhering to them, whether the restrictions are legally binding or not. It launched an online service, Re-open EU, to provide information in 24 languages on what rules are in place in different EU countries, to allow citizens to check what they need to comply with before they travel.Some EU countries exempt politicians who are travelling for work reasons from their Coronavirus restrictions, but Ireland has no such provision.For example under Belgian law, people with an “essential function or need” who are undertaking essential travel are exempted from requirements to quarantine for 14 days on arrival from most countries that apply to everyone else.Belgium’s official list of essential workers includes medical workers, cross-border commuters, agricultural seasonal workers, and diplomats and those working for international organisations.According to these laws Commissioner Phil Hogan, Members of the European Parliament, and any Irish officials travelling to take part in an official EU meeting in Brussels count as essential workers, and are exempt from quarantine requirements as long as they are travelling for work reasons.Firstly, the rules about self-isolating for 14 days are not set down in legislation at all. It is official advice from the Government, like the request not to travel abroad, but it’s not the law.The government offers no exemption for politicians in its quarantine advice: only aircraft, ship and transport crew are exempted.It is a legal requirement to fill out a Covid-19 Passenger Locator Form on arrival from another country. The only people exempted from this are “essential supply chain” workers like air, ship crew and hauliers and accredited diplomats.But there is no exemption for politicians such as Commissioner Hogan, MEPs, or indeed the Taoiseach.Nevertheless, when Taoiseach Micheál Martin returned from Belgium after attending a European Council meeting in July, he did not self-isolate for 14 days and instead went directly into the Dáil the same day to take leaders’ questions.How was he able to do this? When asked by the , the Taoiseach’s office replied with a quote from the Chief Medical Officer Ronan Glynn to say “the Taoiseach, the leader of the country will be doing will be essential work”.This indicates that the Government interprets its own rules to mean that some people can have an ad-hoc exemption from the quarantine requirements, if the chief medical officer deems them to be doing “essential work”.But unlike in Belgium, there is no public list of who counts as “essential”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Netanyahu says now is not the time to drag the country into an unwanted fourth electionSaudi minister says \u0026lsquopeace must be achieved\u0026rsquo on the basis of international agreementsOne found guilty, three acquitted in UN-backed tribunal into killing of former Lebanese PMCourt rules there is no proof Syria was involved in Hariri\u0026rsquos assassinationFour low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/03/12/hong-kong-election-masks.jpg","title":"coronavirus reinfected hong kong covid 19 study","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Hong Kong man experienced a second infection of Covid-19 just four months after recovering from earlier sicknessThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Scientists have reported the world’s first case of a human being reinfected with the coronavirus in a discovery that could have significant implications for the development of vaccines, and hopes of natural immunity against the virus.Researchers at Hong Kong University’s department of microbiology said genetic sequencing of the virus showed that a Hong Kong man was infected twice by different versions of the coronavirus months apart.According to the study, the patient was a 33-year-old man who was in good health. When he was first infected, he suffered a cough, sore throat, fever and headache for three days. He had a test that confirmed Covid-19 and he was hospitalised on 29 March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe was discharged on 14 April after two negative swab tests.Four months later, he was returning to Hong Kong from Spain via the UK when he tested positive during entry screening at Hong King airport on 15 August. He was hospitalised again but had no symptoms throughout.Experts cautioned against jumping to conclusions based on a single case, but they acknowledged that the discovery was a concern.Announcing the results, the Hong Kong University researchers said: “An apparently young and healthy patient had a second episode of Covid-19 infection which was diagnosed 4.5 months after the first episode.“This case illustrates that reinfection can occur just after a few months of recovery from the first infection. Our findings suggest that Sars-CoV-2 may persist in the global human population as is the case for other common-cold associated human coronaviruses, even if patients have acquired immunity via natural infection.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“Since the immunity can be short-lasting after natural infection, vaccination should also be considered for those with one episode of infection.“Patients with previous Covid-19 infection should also comply with epidemiological control measures such as universal masking and social distancing.”If the research, published in the medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, is correct, then it could mean that vaccines against the virus do not give permanent protection and people will not be able to rely on being immune to the virus after recovering from an infection.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDr David Strain, from the University of Exeter, said: “This is a worrying finding for several reasons. The first, as is laid out in this manuscript, is that it suggests that previous infection is not protective. The second is that it raises the possibility that vaccinations may not provide the hope that we have been waiting for.“Vaccinations work by simulating infection to the body, thereby allowing the body to develop antibodies. If antibodies don’t provide lasting protection, we will need to revert to a strategy of viral near-elimination in order to return to a more normal life.”There have already been a number of reports of patients being reinfected with the virus, but these were based on clinical features of the disease. In this case, however, scientists used genetic sequencing to analyse the separate strains of the virus.Dr Jeffrey Barrett, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, urged caution over the news, arguing that it was hard to draw conclusions until the full research study had been published.He said: “This is certainly stronger evidence of reinfection than some of the previous reports because it uses the genome sequence of the virus to separate the two infections. It seems much more likely that this patient has two distinct infections than a single infection followed by a relapse.“An important point about this one case, which is not mentioned in the press release, is that the second infection is asymptomatic. It was caught by screening tests on returning passengers at HK airport, and the inidual never developed any symptoms from their second infection.”He said that given the number of global infections so far, one case of reinfection was not surprising and he warned that the research “implications” were too broad given it was based on one case.“This may be very rare, and it may be that second infections, when they do occur, are not serious (though we don’t know whether this person was infectious during their second episode).”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “The significant thing here is that being reinfected with a mutated strain demonstrates that it is more likely to be reinfection, rather than the same infection that has hung around because the virus has not actually been got rid of, as some people have suggested happens.“The finding of a mutant strain is absolutely nothing to be shocked or surprised by. It would actually be more interesting if there were no mutations cropping up.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ever see 6 water spouts at once?” Mr Leday wrote on Facebook. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWater sprouts are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water,  according to the National Ocean Service.The watery vortexes have the same characteristics as a regular tornado, usually occur during storms and can be just as dangerous as regular tornadoes. Double hurricane threat as two tropical storms advance towards USMr Leday caught sight of the phenomenon as two tropical storms brewed off the coast of the US and hailstones in Louisiana.After a day as a hurricane, Storm Marco brought a surge of high water to the Louisiana coast on Monday, setting the stage for Tropical Storm Laura to enter the Gulf of Mexico and move towards the same stretch of US coast later in the week, most likely as a hurricane.People along the Gulf Coast braced for an onslaught from the twin storms, with many evacuees recalling the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when catastrophic flooding breached the levees in New Orleans and as many as 1,800 people died.“What we know is there’s going to be storm surge from Marco, we know that that water is not going to recede hardly at all before Laura hits, and so we’ve not seen this before and that’s why people need to be paying particular attention,” Governor John Bel Edwards warned at a Sunday briefing.Marco had grown into a hurricane early Sunday, and while its top winds dropped to 50 mph on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center cautioned that Marco could still cause life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds along the Gulf Coast. Marco was centred about 85 miles (135 kilometres) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River Monday morning, moving northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).

Haiti’s prime minister said at least eight other people died and two were missing. In the Dominican Republic, relatives told reporters a collapsed wall killed a mother and her young son.Hundreds of thousands were without power in the Dominican Republic amid heavy flooding in both countries.Despite Marco’s weakening, a storm surge warning remained in place from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A tropical storm warning included Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and metropolitan New Orleans.A storm surge of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast for parts of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In the Iowa caucuses, the first electoral contest of the campaign to become his party’s candidate, the -year old finished in a humiliating fth place. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch,” Biden declared after the disastrous result. One commentator on the news outlet CNBC was even more scathing: “His presidential hopes are finished.”Yet today, Biden stands on the threshold of the Oval Office. Victory is in his grasp. Having clawed his way back into the primaries and won the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump, he could soon be the most powerful man on Earth. It is certainly his fight to lose. Some nationwide opinion polls put him no less than  points ahead of Trump, whose popularity has taken a battering because of the coronavirus crisis and the consequent economic recession. This week’s Democratic convention, including his own powerful, well-crafted speech last night, will have done nothing to undermine his lead.But with some worrying signs of mental decline, Bidens coronation could mean the reigns of power are actually handed to the hardline leftists around him - rather than to the ageing politician himself.What makes Biden’s comeback all the more remarkable is that his two previous attempts to reach the White House failed so miserably. In  his campaign fell apart after he was exposed plagiarising one of the speeches made by Neil Kinnock during the British General Election the previous year. Some of the passages were lted almost word for word. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to go to university ” asked the Labour Leader.“Why is Joe Biden the first in his family ever to go to university ” asked the Democratic Senator. It does not say much for either Biden’s creativity or his judgement that he had to seek secret inspiration from a socialist mediocrity widely known at Westminster as the Welsh Windbag.In  Biden did even worse, dropping out after a woeful performance in the Iowa Caucuses, where he gained just one per cent of the total vote. During the campaign, he regularly put his foot in his mouth, most notoriously when he described his rival Barack Obama as “the first African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy”.This year, after Iowa, his chances seemed to be heading in the same sorry direction.But then, in the following months, he gradually emerged as the front-runner. This was mainly because the other leading candidates were seen as either too extreme or too unlikeable. Senator Elizabeth Warren was a hard advocate of toxic identity politics who unconvincingly claimed to have Native American blood. Bernie Sanders was North America’s answer to Jeremy Corbyn, complete with revolutionary economics and brutish tax plans. Peter Buttigieg was a sanctimonious mayor of a small city in Indiana, without any experience of the national stage.In contrast, Biden had not only been a Delaware senator for  years, but had also served as Vice-President throughout Obama’s time in the White House. Through these roles, he had built up a reputation as a moderate, helped by his image as an ordinary, down-to-earth guy rather than a member of the Washington elite.The son of a used car salesman, he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the place where the US version of Ricky Gervais’s comedy The Office was set. His popular appeal was further enhanced by his personal story of having to cope with agonising grief, which he spelt out in raw, emotive terms last night.The catalogue of anguish includes the loss of his first we and daughter, killed in a car accident in  and the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in . Yet none of this can hide a disturbing reality about Biden, one that makes him profoundly unsuited to be the leader of the free world or the commander-in-chief of the US military.It is something that the Democrats have desperately tried to downplay, along with much of the media. But, the fact is that Joe Biden is in steep mental decline. Already by far the oldest Presidential candidate in history, he shows all the signs of advancing senility. He might be able to read effective from an autocue, as he showed last night, but in other settings, away from the podium, he regularly stumbles over his words, confuses facts, loses his train of thought, and lapses into coherence. His supporters say that he has always been “gaffe-prone” and that is true, but the problem goes much deeper. In the past, Biden could be sharp, even witty, as he showed in his triumphant  Vice-Presidential debate against the Republican Paul Ryan.Today, when speaking off the cuff, he struggles to string basic sentences together.Without the help of a teleprompter, this is a man who mixes up his we and sister, gets the names of countries wrong, and keeps repeating the same phrases. In one bizarre outburst in Iowa, he called a female reporter “a lying, dog-faced pony soldier”. In another contribution, he declared that he will “choose truth over facts”. With a delusional grasp of arithmetic, he has said that million women will be put back to work by his tax credit plan, that million Americans have been killed by guns since , and that million have died from Covid-. That is why, throughout the campaign, his minders have tried to keep him in his Delaware home, almost like a hostage. Major interviews have been banned, public appearances strictly rationed. It is a strategy that his team cynically justy by claiming that they want to protect the -year-old candidate from Covid-. But the determination to shield the potential next President from any accountability makes a mockery of democracy.It might seem bizarre that the Democratic party should march under the tattered standard of such a weakened general. But from the viewpoint of political operators on the left, his decline actually makes him an ideal candidate.His senility might have to be concealed from the public, but it can be ruthlessly exploited in private. Broken and bewildered, Biden is a puppet whose strings can easily be pulled by his hidden masters. Behind the thin veneer of his supposed moderation, the radicals can seize power and enact their hardline policies, like defunding the police, imposing financial reparations for slavery, rewriting American history, confiscating wealth, promoting transgender ideology, extending public ownership, and widening the scope of affirmative action. Precisely because he is now an empty vessel, a Biden Presidency would mean the ruthless enforcement of woke dogma. In fact, its unlikely that he will last a full four-year term. Therefore his Vice President Kamala Harris, an ambitious operator can start preparing for her reign.But perhaps she should not be too hasty. The Democrats’ opportunism could backfire badlyvoters become alienated by the idea of an enfeebled President.After all, the American political structure – in contrast to our Parliamentary system – is built on the concept of a strong executive headed by a powerful, elected head of state. Already Trump, never one to pull his punches, is running adverts that highlight concerns about the “cognitive decline” of “Sleepy Joe”. The commercials seem to be having an impact. Almost  per cent of Americans do not think that Biden will serve a full term, while other polls show the race narrowing. Trump could also be boosted by revulsion at the radical Democrats’ agenda, especially the collusion with urban violence.In  widespread unrest fuelled by the civil rights movement enabled the Republican Richard Nixon to defeat the Democrats under Hubert Humphrey. Famously, Nixon said that the “silent majority”, ignored by the media, had spoken. Today the same public mood could give Trump a second term.It would be no more than the Democrats deserve for their eagerness to hide the real Joe Biden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politicians have repeatedly let us down, their lack of clarity is baffling and there still appears to be no coherent plan.I’ve watched as people cared for the sick and mourned their dead, and at times, like many of you, I’ve been overwhelmed by dread.Then I look at my friend and colleague Kate Garraway, who has had to bear the burden of her husband Derek being ambushed by Covid- in April.Kate has been extraordinary, which is why I am furious with those who have criticised her for ing to work, when they have absolutely no idea of what she has been going through. She has decided to step back from GMB for a while to concentrate on Derek and their children and those who have criticised her should be ashamed of themselves for making things even more dficult for the whole family. Derek may now be free of the virus but the after-effects have been catastrophic.The poor man has been in an induced coma, and although now more aware of his surroundings, he is still extremely ill.Kate’s mantra “where there is le, there’s hope”, has kept her going, and I reckon on some level Derek is aware of how much she and their children, Darcy, , and -year-old Billy are willing him to make a recovery.Kate has been astonishingly brave and positive throughout this whole ordeal, although she was tearful this week when talking about Derek’s recent birthday. His family sang Happy Birthday to him via Facebook, which must have been bittersweet for all of them.She has had to maintain a brave face for her children and give them some sort of stability for the past five months.To try to further give their lives a bit more normality, Kate went back to work last month.In fact, she was actively encouraged to do so by doctors who felt it was essential for her wellbeing, and frankly, she has to make a living because she has two children to take care of.I know coming back to presenting duties on Good Morning Britain wasn’t easy for Kate, and there have been a few wobbles when she has given updates on how Derek is doing, but all of us are so proud of the way she has coped.That’s why the nasty, malicious carping from moronic trolls is so upsetting. How dare they have a go at Kate for hosting the show and having the “audacity” to smile and laugh at funny items with her co-hosts. It’s sickening, and no matter how much anyone tries to ignore such malevolent cretins, Kate will have been deeply hurt.I had a horrible feeling this might happen, but thankfully the vast majority of viewers wish her nothing but the best, and would be overjoyed to see Derek on the road to recovery. All of us admire Kate’s courage and honesty and know that even in the darkest of times, it’s vital to hang on to positivity and yes, to even have a giggle at something silly or absurd.Watching their mum back on TV gave much needed routine and stability to Darcy and Billy, especially seeing her smile and having fun. They knew it didn’t mean she is not worried sick about their dad, but were well aware he would want her to continue working and providing for the family.As a journalist, Kate has amassed so much knowledge about Covid- and she has also been tested to her very limits.Typically, she wants to pass on that knowledge to help others and is planning to write a book about her experiences and what she has learned during this tough time. It was always her plan to do a self-help book and she had begun it before the pandemic, but now her wise words will be even more relevant and helpful than ever. I can’t wait for the day when Derek is back home, growing stronger every day and the whole family is finally reunited, and I hope she is back at work with us very soon.Happy Birthday Madonna –  years old, mad as a box of frogs but looking utterly radiant surrounded by her children at a party in Jamaica.She can be infuriating and even downright bonkersbut there’s no one quite like her.She’s a trailblazer, was always a staunch ally for the LGBT community before it was trendy and has always paddled her own canoe.Long may Her Madge continue to reign, especially as right now we need some light relief wherever we can get it. I’M not in the least bit surprised that “dad bods” have become so popular among women of all ages. These are the bodies belonging to men who proudly show off rather cute little pot bellies and love handles.Becoming softer round the edges usually happens to blokes after the birth of a couple of kids, when they start to comfort eat due to lack of sleep and stop being obsessed with going to the gym.These boys trade top-of-the-range bikes and tight Lyrca cycling gear for comfy joggers while pushing a pram, and are all the better for it.Having a dad bod is also seen as a sign of confidence, being happy in your own skin and showing that you enjoy le and that having a weekend pizza and a couple of beers is more than OK.I reckon there’s nothing more off-putting than a man with a ripped six-pack who is no stranger to the mirror and exists on steroids and just steamed vegetables.They are usually dull, self-obsessed and not in the least bit alluring.Dad bods are far less intimidating and much more fun to cuddle. Like a lot of men, famous stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron have developed the Dad Bod during lockdown and have been roundly showing off their new physiques.I think they are far more sexy and desirable than when their cheekbones could cut through a home-made loaf. You have to get the balance right, though. When it tips over into a very large balcony hanging over “the nursery” then that’s no longer a Dad Bod but just a big old beer gut and it shows a man who has simply given up and is on a fast track to obesity and a heart attack. BRITNEY Spears is a grown-up woman with two teenage sons, a hugely successful music career and an adoring fan base. But the -year-old has less freedom than an impoverished girl in a Jane Austen novel.Since her much-publicised meltdown in  – when she went into a beauty salon and shaved her head, looking like a little lost deer caught in the headlights – Britney has had very little control over her le.Her father Jamie has legal “conservatorship” over his daughter, basically deciding where and how she lives her le and conducts her career. He also keeps hold of the purse strings.Last year he stepped away from the role, citing health problems of his own . . . and Britney doesn’t want him back.Thirteen years ago she was clearly suffering with mental health issues and needed her father’s help.But now Britney understandably wants control of her own destiny.This week she decided to fight back and took to the courts to have her human rights and civil liberties restored.But her bid was unsuccessful and she will need to wait until February  before taking further action.She is a fragile woman and obviously needs support. But looking at it from the outside, the kind of control her father exerts over Britney’s le seems way too much.Surely some kind of compromise can be reached, with the situation regularly revised to ensure Britney isn’t left feeling trapped like a songbird in a very gilded cage.I SIMPLY cannot begin to imagine the pain actor John Michie and his family are going through right now.This week, the man who supplied the drugs that killed John’s daughter in  had his manslaughter conviction quashed.Louella Fletcher-Michie had gone to a music festival with her boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, who gave her the hallucinogenic C-P drug and filmed her tripping for hours. Belatedly realising she was in real trouble and crying for her mum, he phoned her family. They rushed to the scene but were too late to save her. Crucially, he did not at any point take her to a medical tent or seek expert help.This week a High Court judge decided that evenhe had called for paramedics, it was not clear Louella would have survived – so Broughton’s appeal against his sentence of eight and a half years was upheld. Broughton has to live with his actions but not from behind bars.Meanwhile, John and his family – who have maintained a dignied silence through the most recent twist of the kne in their tragedy – continue to mourn their lost Louella.For them, it is a le sentence of heartbreak and pain.JUST when you thought reality telly’s Below Deck couldn’t get any better, they go and set a whole series in Tahiti.There are all the usual shenanigans. Entitled and demanding guests, the crew squabbling one minute and at it like rabbits the next and Captain Lee sailing above it all while coming out with hilarious one liners like: “I’m madder than a p***ed-on chicken”, which I plan to use as often as possible in my daily le.Meanwhile, all the action takes place amid the amazing sunrises and stunning sunsets of the South Pacic.It’s no exaggeration to say that this utterly ludicrous, vacuous and extremely daft series has kept me sane during these scary times.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like.

Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way.

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes. But Angela bounced back.Her advice this week to family and friends is to keep calm and occupied.Angela, from North London, is adamant Britain “will get through this” – and given all that she has survived, she should know.So let’s all take that on board. This lady has a great attitude, something we should all adopt.Frankie Bridge is under fire for posting a photo of her children watching iPads at the dinner table – with some people up in arms about how unacceptable it is.But perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones.By which I mean that anyone who has children and wants to have a nice time knows kids are not always great at sitting through long, fancy dinners out.Some people think going out to dinner is a treat and children should learn to behave properly.Butyou ask young kids to sit and wait for their food, they will get restless.And there is a definite argument that going out to dinner should be a treat for the adults too.If that means a bit of screen time for the kids while at the table, well, who am I to judge GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Strict rules do not work as people seem to break them.The Scandinavian country recorded  new cases on Friday and  on Saturday.Stefan Lofven, the prime minister, insisted on Friday their response to the pandemic was right.He told the newspaper Dagens Nyheter: The strategy that we adopted, I believe is right - to protect iniduals, limit the spread of the infection.What has been discussed most, and what we did dferently in Sweden, was that we did not close schools. Now there are quite a few people who think we were right.From the beginning in the global outbreak, Sweden introduced voluntary social-distancing rules, home-working and recommendations for people to avoid public transport.The compulsory measures that were brought in included a ban on gatherings of more than  people, restrictions on visiting care homes, and table-only service in bars and restaurants.However, the decision to not lockdown has come with consequences.A total of , Swedes have died of Covid- - signicantly higher than its neighbours Norway,Denmark and Finland.Anders Tegnell, the top epidemiologist leading the response to Swedens pandemic, claimed the infection rates of Spain, Belgium and France have increased after mask mandates in public spaces came in. He said last week: The belief that masks can solve our problem is very dangerous.When looking at the total number of people infected since the pandemic began, Sweden has one of the highest figures in Europe with  cases per ,.That is more than double of France - recording  cases per ,.However, Dr Tegnell claims the higher level of cases indicates a form of immunity among the population by people carrying antibodies for Covid-.Dr Tegnell told the Unherd website last month: What we are seeing now in Sweden is a rapid decline in the number of cases, and of course some sort of immunity must be responsible for that since nothing  has changed.A study published last week by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm people who test negative for antibodies may still have a high level of immunity.Dr Tegnell said: I think it is likely that such outbreaks will be easier to control in Sweden because there is immunity among the population.Professor Marcus Buggert, an immunologist at the institute, said: T-cells are a type of white blood cells that are specialised in recognising virus-infected cells. Our results indicate that roughly twice as many people have developed T-cell immunity compared with those who we can detect antibodies in.Earlier this month, the BBC pointed out that Swedens antibody rate is fairly similar to the UKs.The broadcaster said it compared with  per cent of Londoners found with coronavirus antibodies when tested in April and May, and five-to-ten per cent of people living in Geneva.Sweden has faced sharp criticism for the governments decision to not lockdown.

The investigation came after Dame Margaret was said to have shouted at Mr Corbyn in a corridor, accusing him of racism and being antisemitic. A new book by journalists Gabriel Pogrund and Patrick Maguire claims the relationship fell apart because Mr McDonnell felt it was wrong to hold the probe.  The book says: “A question that preoccupied aides was whether McDonnell and Corbyn were comrades or personal friends first. “For a period that summer it was clear they were neither.” It said McDonnell “exploded” over the  investigation into Dame Margaret, a party member for more than  years. The book claims: “One senior aide said, ‘They never spoke for months. Never spoke the whole summer.’ The leader refused to contact the man to whom he had once been a lone friend in politics. By the end of the summer, neither was answering the other’s calls.”  The book quotes another Labour staffer saying: “They were walking past each other in the corridor and blanking each other – it was that level of not talking.” The book, serialised in The Times, says Mr Corbyn’s senior policy adviser Andrew Fisher was sent to Norfolk, where the Shadow Chancellor was on holiday on the Broads, to negotiate a settlement. It adds: “After a call with Corbyn and his aides, McDonnell agreed to bury the hatchet.” The book, ‘Left Out: The Inside Story of Labour Under Corbyn’, adds: “A question that troubled some was whether Corbyn categorised antisemitism as the kind of racism he set himself against.” "},{"url":null,"title":"schools covid 19 safe scientists","story":"NewsAre schools Covid- safe  Scientists advice explained as Boris Johnson demands The Prime Minister says theres a moral duty to send children back to school - but does re-opening classrooms pose a risk to students, teachers and family members  Heres what experts thinkShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsBoris Johnson wants all children back in school next month \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

And ministers have warned parents they risk a finethey refuse to send their children back to school, as a last resort.But with the coronavirus still present and being transmitted in communities, is it safe for children toto schools Hereaposs a look at the safety and logistics of schools reopening. What have the experts said  The UKaposs chief medical officers have warned children are more at risk of long-term harmthey do not attend school thanthey . In a joint statement, the advisers said children have an exceptionally low risk of dying from the disease and very few,any children and teenagers would come to long-term harm from the virus solely by attending school.Should parents be fined for not sending their kids back to school  Tell us in the comments below And what is the latest scientic evidence   A study by Public Health England , published on Sunday, found there were  single confirmed cases, four co-primary casesand  outbreaks of Covid- in schools during June. It said the majority of cases linked to outbreaks were in staff, transmission between students was very rare, and where children did contract the virus, they were more likely to catch it at home, usually from a parent. Is there a risk to clinically extremely vulnerable pupils or parents  As the shielding programme for children and adults was paused on August , guidance says that pupils in this group canto school, as can those who have family members who are shielding. But,a local area sees a spike of Covid-, children or family members who live there will be advised to shield while rates remain high, and so may be temporarily absent from school. What about the risk of children coming home from school and infecting parents or grandparents   The Chief Medical Officers say international evidence suggests transmission from school-age children to parents or family members is rare. But they admit this evidence is weak. Teenagers, they say, may be more likely to transmit to adults than younger children. And they say that because schools connect households, itaposs likely reopening them will put some upward pressure on transmission more widely. But the Chiefs say this is as much to do with aposindirectapos linking as it is a direct result of opening schools. That means some of the bump in transmission is likely to be from parents being able toto workplaces because schools are open, and from parents meeting up at the school gates. What measures are schools putting in place  The Government has set out a series of measures that all schools must follow, including good respiratory hygiene and enhanced cleaning procedures, such as hand sanitiser stations in classrooms. More regular hand-washing is advised and staff should ensure that children do so when they arrive at school,from their break, change rooms and after eating. Those who have symptoms of Covid-, or are in a household with someone displaying symptoms, should be kept away from the school. How dferent will the school day look for pupils  Staggering break and lunch times should be looked at and, ensuring that teaching time is maintained, schools should consider staggered start and finish times to keep groups apart as they arrive and leave school. When timetabling lessons, schools should ensure that dferent groups, or bubbles, are kept apart and movement around the school should be kept to a minimum. What are school bubbles and how will they work   As a way of minimising contact between students, and so reducing transmission of the disease, guidance recommends keeping groups of children separate in bubbles. Guidance suggests that in secondary schools the bubble is likely to be the size of a year group to enable staff to deliver the full range of curriculum subjects, while smaller group sizes may be implemented with younger children. Groups should be kept apart where possible, and older pupils should be encouraged to keep their distance from other children and teachers within the same group. But how will the groups be maintained  A headteachersapos union has warned that it will be enormously challenging for schools to keep children apart in year-group-sized bubbles. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: The logistics of keeping apart many dferent aposbubblesapos of children in a full school, including whole year groups comprising hundreds of pupils, is mind-boggling. Whatsomeone becomes unwell at school  If a pupil or a member of staff has symptoms of the virus, they should stay at home and arrange a test. In the case of a positive test, everyone within the school that had been in close contact with the pupil or staff member will be asked to self-isolate. A school will be said to have an outbreakthere are two or more confirmed cases within  days or an overall rise in absence where Covid- is suspected.

Researchers made the discovery by injecting saline with tiny microbubbles into the veins of  critically ill Covid- patients and tracked the bubbles using ultrasound. Normally, the bubbles would travel through the heart and enter the lungs, but would not get through the lungs because they would not fit through the capillaries. In more than % of these patients, however, the bubbles passed through the lungs and reached the blood vessels of the brain, which means the lung#xs capillaries were abnormally dilated, researchers reported earlier this month in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. The more bubbles that made their way beyond patients#x lungs, the lower their oxygen levels, researchers said.This #xCmay explain the disproportionate low oxygen levels seen in many patients with Covid- pneumonia,#xD coauthor Dr. Hooman Poor of the Mount Sinai - National Jewish Health Respiratory Institute in New York City told Reuters.It is possible the higher than normal amount of blood flowing to the brain could be linked to neurological conditions associated with the coronavirus, such as tiredness.

Warren Harrison who has been headmaster of The Premier Academyaposs Eaton Mill Primary School, in Milton Keynes, Bucks, for  years, issued a newsletter last week to parents on the schoolaposs new safety measures. Mr Harrison instructed them that all children will be required to wear surgical masks when being dropped off and picked up from school. The letter stated that all staff, children, parents, carers and visitors must don a mask when on site, or they will not be allowed access. Children will then be allowed to take off the masks and switch them for a named face visor - provided by the school - once in their classrooms. The newsletter also stated that pupils will be required to wear face masks or shields while moving around the school, for instance visiting the toilets. Masks and shields may be removed when outside of the school buildings, for eating purposes and during the class bubbleaposs daily walks. These rules will be applied to all pupils from Year  upwards, when pupilsto the school - which holds an aposOutstandingapos rating from Ofsted - on September . The decision was taken after the headteacher says nearly a third of parents had threatened to keep kids away.  Mr Harrison revealed that another factor was that five members of staff resigned at the start of summer citing Covid- as the reason. He also told how over a quarter of staff at the school were found to have underlying health issues. This means that these staff members - who made up % of school faculty - could not go into the school to teach children of key workers early on in lockdown. Mr Harrison said today that he hopes the schoolaposs safety measures will encourage all pupils and staff to- for the sake of their mental and social wellbeing.  He said: The school has now spent £, on preventative equipment for pupils. These includes PPE and thermal scanners, as well as everything they will need in classrooms throughout the day - face visors, water bottles, pencil cases. Nothing will need to be brought into school with them, and nothing will be taken home. It is all provided in classrooms. Thataposs a hell of an expenditure on our part - but itaposs all about minimising risk. What is the problem with putting in an added layer of protection  You wouldnapost put your child on a bicycle without putting a helmet on their head. And itaposs also about making sure the staff with underlying health issues feel comfortable coming back in to school. Teachers will be wearing face visors in classrooms, too. Iaposm hoping that all the staff will come back in. We know the importance of getting kids back into school. What we donapost want is to be one of those schools, like weaposre seeing in Berlin at the moment, that re-opens - and then has to send kids home again because of a surge in cases.

The fast food chain axed its -year-old catchphrase amid concerns it “doesn’t quite fit in the current environment”. It has released images of new advertising posters with the two world famous key words blurred out leaving just “it’s good” visible. KFC said it was a temporary suspension as the message did not suit the hygiene message in the new normal. But bosses vowed the phrase would make a comeback “when the time is right”. KFC admitted it had set itself a major headache trying to find a substitute slogan more than six decades after “it’s finger lickin’ good” was enough to identy its fried chicken pieces. Kate Wall, head of advertising at KFC UK said: “People often say that it’s the second movie that’s hardest to get right. The follow-up, the next step. And we are facing the same conundrum at the moment. “How do you follow a slogan that’s lasted for  years and is as iconic as ours  “Well, we know we can do it with a little help from our friends. And you’ll be hearing more from us on this soon.” Unveiling the new look ads with “finger” and “lickin’” pixelated in a YouTube video, KFC told viewers: “That thing we all say  Ignore it. For now.” Catherine Tan-Gillespie, global chief marketing officer at KFC said: “We find ourselves in a unique situation - having an iconic slogan that doesn’t quite fit in the current environment.  “While we are pausing the use of ‘It’s Finger Lickin’ Good’, rest assured the food craved by so many people around the world isn’t changing one bit.” The fast food chain which has more than  restaurants across the UK and Ireland and employs , staff recently fell foul of public opinion after its “finger lickin’ good” ads in late February showed diners greedily licking their hands after a meal.

Doug, a -month-old pug, miraculously survived the ordeal without the need for surgery although the large needle became lodged in his stomach. His owner Sonia Wheeler, , had been sewing at her dining room table in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, when the needle fell onto the floor. Doug swallowed it whole, along with a small thread during lockdown. The pug was dashed to animal hospital Wear Referrals, in Bradbury, County Durham, where X-rays showed the metal had become stuck in his stomach and he needed emergency treatment.  Sonia, who is a hairdresser, today told : I was sewing at my dining room table when the needle dropped to the floor - Doug darted straight to the needle and picked it up in his mouth. Panic ran through me as he’s a typical puppy who swallows anything you attempt to take from him but it was gone before I knew it. Doug was not phased and was his usual bouncy, playful and ever-so-charming self, as though he’d done nothing wrong.  The opportunity for him to have the needle removed without having surgery was fantastic to hear. Vets safely removed the needle and thread without any surgery and Doug has since made a full recovery. Heaposs now back home with his owners. Doug has recovered remarkably well and is back to his cheeky little self, with a love of cuddles, sunshine and the outdoors, Sonia added.  Chiara Giannasi, internal medicine clinician at Wear Referrals, led Doug’s treatment and carried out an endoscopy to remove the offending object.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed. Buckingham Palace is usually open to the public for  weeks each summer and selected dates during winter and spring. But due to the coronavirus pandemic it has remained closed to visitors after a decision made by the Royal Collection Trust last month because of the operational challenges of social distancing in their palaces and properties.

On August  elaborate celebrations will be held to mark the anniversary of Kim Jong-il founding of Songun. Songun is a political ideological unique to North Korea that claims all problems in society can be corrected by giving priority to military affairs Ahead of the event the North Korean government released a film containing images of current leader Kim, his birth mother Ko Yong-hui and his we Ri Sul-ju.The  minute video shows Ko Yong-hui in Osandeok City in the North Hamgyeong Province - the hometown of Kim Jong-il, Daily NK reported.The film later shows Kim as a child, reading, making art and planting trees together with his mum. In North Korea Kimaposs mother is only referred to by titles, such as The Respected Mother who is the Most Faithful and Loyal aposSubjectapos to the Dear Leader Comrade Supreme Commander. The circumstances surround her death are unclear.On  August , ious sources reported that she had died in Paris from unspecic illness, probably of breast cancer.Other reports claims that she was treated in Paris in the spring of  and then flown back to Pyongyang where she fell into a coma and died in August that year.The previous regime attempted to build a cult of personality around Ko prior to Kimaposs ascent to power.Such moves have been frustrated by her lowly origins, as considered by North Koreaaposs songbun class system. Not only did Koaposs Korean-Japanese heritage make her part of the lowest hostile class, her fatheraposs work in a Japanese army sewing factory rendered her the low of the low in North Korean eyes. Kim is said to be fearful that public knowledge of details of his motheraposs upbringing would undermine his familyaposs pure bloodline. As a consequence Koaposs name became an official state secret after Kim Jong-il died in . She is now referred to by her nicknames. It was reported earlier today that rumours about Kimaposs health are circulating again.  Whispers that he could be dead started again after a South Korean diplomat sensationally claimed the North Korean leader is in a coma. Chang Song-min, a former aide to South Korea’s late president Kim Dae-jung, didnapost provide any evidence to back up his claim - the same one he made months ago only for Kim to be pictured in public days later.

The Queen and Prince Philip will spend the next few months at their ,-acre Scottish estate and their relatives and in-laws will come and stay at dferent points.According to her granddaughter Princess Eugenie, the stunning castle is where the Monarch is the most happy, and she loves spending time with her children and their familes. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their kids George, Charlotte and Louis, Prince Charles, Camilla, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry and the York sisters all pop in to stay with the Queen and Philip during their holidays - making it a very busy time for them.But what exactly do the royals get up to during their Scottish break  Due to social distancing, relatives will stay at separate accommodation rather than sleeping in the Castle itself. However the majority of their normal holiday activities take place outdoors anyway, so they wonapost have to make many changes to ensure everyone is safe. Speaking on ITVaposs documentary Our Queen at , Eugenie, who was spotted arriving at the Castle last week, talked about previous trips to Balmoral.  She said: Itaposs the most beautul place on earth. I think Granny is the most happy there, I think she really, really loves the Highlands…walks, picnics, dogs, a lot of dogs, thereaposs always dogs, and people coming in and out all the time. Family-wise weaposre all there, so itaposs a lovely base for Granny and Grandpa to be - for us to come and see them up there where you just have room to breathe and run. But according to an insider, itaposs not almost the most relaxing break and things can be pretty hectic.  They told Vanity Fair: “It can get quite busy at what they call ‘the big house’ and it’s not especially relaxing even though it’s a holiday. “There’s a daily routine which evolves around meal times, several outfit changes every day, sometimes five, and the Queen likes everything to run like clockwork. The focus is on being outdoors and in the countryside walking, grousing, fishing and hunting.” Balmoral is a working estate with highlights including grouse moors, the lush green forests and farmland, as well as plenty of animals from the herds of deer to Highland cattle and ponies.  The Royals love grouse hunting, and go out regularly during their time at the castle. Prince Charles, William, Harry and Kate have all been known to go out shooting over the summer months, and last year they even took little George along to watch.However, they were forced to call off the whole grouse shooting season last year as there was a drop in the number of the birds in the area due to insects and bad  weather. Photographer Milton Gendel said he was invited to Balmoral back in  , and opened up about the experience to  Vanity Fair  .He wrote: On some days there were excursions into the country. The Queen had been taught to drive by auxiliary army officers during World War II, and she handled a Land Rover with intrepid skill on the hilly and winding roads. When we went riding, she saddled her horse, and afterward carried the saddle back to the stable herself.  At a shoot on the grounds a truck delivered a sumptuous buffet lunch. The aposgunsapos lay on the grass for a postprandial respite. The Queen and her sister walked about, deep in conversation. They were very close when apart, they telephoned two or three times a day. The atmosphere was always agreeable, buoyed by the light touch of the Queen and her sister.

But these widely prescribed drugs can come with a hidden cost. They are just a few of the le-saving and le-changing medicines which can disrupt nutrient absorption. And the more of them you take – and the longer you take them — the greater the risk of developing potentially dangerous nutrient deficiencies. Michael Wakeman, a pharmacist and specialist in nutritional medicine, was alerted to the danger after spotting a scientic paper which was aptly titled: “Effects of widely used drugs on micronutrients: a story rarely told.” It led to five years of research, trawling medical journals and scientic papers, which he says “was like peeling an onion. The more you dig and the more layers you peel away, the more problems you discover. “Some of the links – such as metformin and vitamin B – are quite well-known, but the more you look, the more you find.” NHS dietitian Catherine Collins says: “Medications impact nutrient status in a number of ways. They reduce uptake by binding with the nutrient, or a co-factor needed for absorption there can be issues with increased clearance and there can be metabolic changes influencing absorption.” In many cases, the impacts are quite subtle, so they are not listed as potential side effects. But taking several medicines, each with a small effect, can easily add up to a serious deficiency. Problems are compounded by the fact that the number of medicines we take tends to increase as we get older, when our bodies are less efficient at absorbing nutrients. Dietary gaps and bad habits, such as smoking and drinking alcohol, add to the risk of shortfalls. Catherine Collins says not to take nutrients in large doses, unless it is on medical advice, but adds: “A generic vitamin and mineral supplement can be useful to mop up micronutrient deficiencies.” Just  medicines account for almost a third of prescriptions dispensed each year and Mr Wakeman says four out of five of them have some impact on nutrient status. Metformin impairs uptake of vitamin B, and this is flagged up as a “very rarely reported” side effect on information ­leaflets. However, one study warned as many as % of diabetics taking metformin for three or more years develop problems. Eating a vegan or vegetarian diet and older age, also increase the risk of being low in vitamin B. Shortfalls can cause muscle weakness and nerve damage, which is also a common complication of diabetes. Mr Wakeman suspects some cases of deficiency are being misdiagnosed as diabetic neuropathy. Metformin also reduces levels of folate, thiamine, magnesium and vitamin D — which is important for immunity. Mr Wakeman says: “The last thing I want to do is scare anyone into stopping taking metformin, but it is important people are aware of the issue and, in my opinion, it would make sense to take a multivitamin with a higher level of vitamin B.” Emma Elvin, senior clinical adviser at Diabetes UK, says: “It could be dficult to identy the exact cause of any nerve ­problems in people with diabetes, ­especiallythey have a B deficiency too. The most important thing is that it is identied and treated appropriately.” Proton pump inhibitors such as ­omeprazole, lansoprazole and other drugs ending in “azole” are often taken alongside metformin and medicines for high blood pressure and heart problems. They are also sold over the counter as Nexiumor Guardium. These PPIs reduce stomach acid, which disrupts absorption of a range of nutrients including vitamin B,vitamin C, betacarotene, iron, folic acid, magnesium and calcium. Several studies have reported low magnesium levels in patients taking PPIs for a year or more.Magnesium is found in a range of foods including green vegetables, nuts and wholegrains, but the National Diet and Nutrition Survey found that % of working-age adults and % of over-s have low levels. Signs of a deficiency include tiredness, cramps, nausea and abnormal heart rhythms. Diuretics such as bumetanide, furosemide and metolazone alter the way the kidneys work and this can accelerate excretion of potassium, magnesium, thiamine, vitamin C and folic acid. Loss of potassium is the most common problem, and patients are often advised to take a supplement. Signs of a shortfall include fatigue, weakness, muscle cramps and constipation. Potassium-rich foods include bananas, spinach and avocados. Ace-inhibitors – which usually end in “pril”, such as ramipril, captopril and ­enalapril – are associated with low levels of vitamin D. We make vitamin D, which is important for immunity, from sunshine and shortfalls are common. The Chief Medical Officers suggest everyone takes a mcg supplement of vitamin D in winter. Millions of Britons take statins to reduce their risk of heart disease. However, these cholesterol-lowering drugs also reduce absorption of coenzyme Q, which cells need for growth and repair. The impact of statins on vitamin D ies, but there is evidence that people with already low levels are at increased risk of muscle pain – a known side-effect of these drugs.

She describes herself as a Plain Jane and says she was a geek, but in the years since sheaposs undergone a complete transformation, both mentally and physically, and is much happier for it. In fact, Roxy is now so dferent that she claims many of her old classmates donapost recognise her when she runs into them in her home city Cardf. At , sheaposs now a bikini model and has recently retrained as a personal trainer, and is proud of the outgoing adult sheaposs become. She said: “You wouldn’t recognise me physically and mentallyyou knew me when I was at school - a lot of people don’t. “I was really skinny growing up - my legs were just as thick as my arms. Now I’ve got an athletic figure and I’m a completely dferent person. I was painfully shy as a child. I was a geek and academic and didn’t get into trouble. “I had a bit of acne and never wore makeup because my dad didn’t like it - so I wasn’t really able to explore it. I was a bit of a plain Jane.  “Things changed when I went to sixth form and I was put with people I didn’t know. I was forced to talk and thrown in the deep end. “When I was  I bought a self-help book and that really started to build my confidence. “That and more le experience have made me a dferent person. It has been a gradual process but wearing makeup and glamming myself did help.  “If you feel confident on the inside, you feel confident on the outside. After finishing school Roxy studied health nutrition at university and got a number of office jobs. But her confidence started to grow when she began lting weights about four years ago and saw how her body was changing. Teaching herself with YouTube videos and books she quickly turned her skinny physique into a sleek athletic one which motivated her further to start wearing makeup and doing her hair. She went on to enter bikini competitions before qualying as a personal trainer three years ago - something she initially did part-time. But since being furloughed due to the coronavirus pandemic, Roxy has now dedicated all of her time to her passion and is hoping to turn it into a full-time career.This involves her confidently speaking to strangers - something she’d never have done as a teenager. And the transformation has given her a more lucrative career, as well as a new lease of le.  She said: “I make more money per hour doing personal training. My office job was £ an hour but personal training is around £ an hour so there’s potential to make a lot more money. “Before lockdown I was working  hours a week. I worked from .am until pm so I could only train people before or after work or on the weekend.

According to a tracker by John Hopkins University, there have been ,, Covid- cases globally and the killer virus has claimed , lives to date. More than  million people have recovered. But there are  nations where their government claim they have managed to remain coronavirus-free. Some authorities are unlikely to admitthey have an outbreak while countries that are remote islands are able to evade the virus by refusing to let outsiders in, the Business Insider reports. The Cook Islands The South Pacic island is self-ruling but is in free association with New Zealand so closed its borders to the country when it saw a spike in cases. Last week week its former prime minister Joseph Williams was hospitalised with coronavirus but he is in New Zealand Prime Minister Henry Puna said: We are taking very serious measures in order to protect our people and to control and keep this deadly disease away from our shores.  Federated States of Micronesia The Pacic Ocean island country is made up of more than  islands and has a population of ,. It closed its borders and formed a task force which has rehearsed what the nation would dothere were any cases. Citizens of Federated States of Micronesia that have ed to the island from abroad must quarantine. Kiribati The Pacic Island nation has a population of more than ,. People wishing to enter Kiribati from a country with an ongoing transmission of the virus must spend  days in a coronavirus-free country. They must also produce medical evidence they have tested negative for the virus on entry to Kiribati. The Marshall Islands The Pacic Ocean island has almost , people and comprises of , inidual islands and islets. Its official name is officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands and it has closed its borders to all international travellers. Domestic flights between Majuro, the islands capital, and Kwajalein, the southernmost part of the country have also been cancelled.  Nauru Nauru is a Pacic Ocean island country of more than , people. Itaposs the worldaposs smallest island nation measuring just eight square miles. Its government has expressed concerns about the growing number of coronavirus cases in surrounding countries including Australia and New Zealand.  Niue Niue is one of the worldaposs smallest countries with a population of less than , people. The South Pacic Ocean island country has close links to New Zealand. It lies between Tonga and the Cook Islands.  North Korea The countryaposs dictator Kim Jong-un has denied any confirmed cases but has repeatedly warned the virus is a threat. It already has little contact and travel with the rest of the world but it closed it borders further in January, and recently quarantined a border town after a defector entered from South Korea. Experts are sceptical about its claims of no cases and believe the country may have had an outbreak in March or even earlier.  Palau The Pacic Ocean country is an archipelago of more than  islands and around , people. Its health ministry has issued guidelines on how citizens can protect themselves from contracting the virus and all travellers must quarantine on entry. It said: While we do not want people to panic, we need to be vigilant and cautious, and to practise current recommended preventive measures, including frequent handwashing, practicing respiratory etiquettes, social distancing, and preparing aswe are going to get that first confirmed case.

Solomon Islands The nation, made up of a series of islands, rolled out very strict entry restrictions early in the pandemic. The country has a population of around ,. The government is currently drawing up plans on how it can allow tourists back without bringing the virus into the country.

Since March, Tonga has quarantined people, implemented a curfew, banned large groups and contact sports, and urged social distancing in case the virus had entered the country. It also closed its borders to flights and cruise ships.  Turkmenistan The dictatorship claims it is coronavirus-free but experts say Turkmenistan is one of the most repressive and secretive countries in the world. The island, which gained independence the Soviet Union in , already claims it has no citizens with HIV Aids, which experts say is not possible. But Turkmenistan is already one of the hardest countries in the world to enter and at the beginning of the outbreak it made things tougher which may have helped it avoid any cases.

The scientists say the case illustrates that reinfection can occur a few months after recovery from the first infection. The findings indicate the disease, which has killed more than , people worldwide, will continue to spread among the global population despite herd immunity, they said. The -year-old male was cleared of Covid- and discharged from a hospital in April, but tested positive again after ing from Spain via the UK on August . The patient had appeared to be previously healthy, researchers said in the paper, which was accepted by the international medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. He was found to have contracted a dferent coronavirus strain from the one he had previously contracted and remained asymptomatic for the second infection. The finding does not mean taking vaccines will be useless, Dr Kai-Wang To, one of the leading authors of the paper, told Reuters.  Immunity induced by vaccination can be dferent from those induced by natural infection, To said. [We] will need to wait for the results of the vaccine trials to seehow effective vaccines are. World Health Organisationepidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said today that there was no need to jump to any conclusions in response to the Hong Kong case. Instances of people discharged from hospitals and testing positive again for Covid- infection have been reported in mainland China. However, in those cases it was not clear whether they had contracted the virus again after full recovery - as happened to the Hong Kong patient - or still had the virus in their body from the initial infection. The preliminary number of patients in China who tested positive again once being discharged from hospital was %-%, Wang Guiqiang, an infectious disease specialist in Chinaaposs expert group for COVID- treatment, said during a press briefing in May.

The History of Dundee FC’ and ‘They Wore The Dark Blue’ books, told Tele Sport: “The season before they went to Dens Park,  , the club had gone for more high-profile players and had spent a lot of money on wages.“There were some controversial things happening, some disciplinary issues with players and then some directors not backing up other directors when it came to dealing with it.“To save money, they went with largely local lads the next season. I think the only top player they had was Sandy Keillor who was an outstanding player for a decade.“Dundee couldn’t pay off the debt, though, and were wound up. But the Scottish League stepped in, they wanted to keep a presence north of the Tay, and asked them not to pack in but to wait a while.“Essentially Dundee Football and Athletic Club liquidated and they played the last two games of the season with the new set-up under the name Dundee Football Club.“The club were fortunate that the lease for Carolina Port was changed for commercial use and the new like-minded committee moved to Dens Park.“There were now a group of like-minded people with the same drive and determination to grow the club. And the supporters responded.”Indeed, a packed Gilfillan Hall saw a new committee formed with the influential Bailie John Robertson appointed president.Soon, though, the club were without a home as their Carolina Port ground was being taken over by dock work.Gussie Park was considered before the committee settled on leasing some agricultural land alongside Provost Road and Dens Road.It was a steeply sloping bit of land but Robertson remarked the creation of the ground had been by “putting stout hearts to a stf brae” while the stand at Carolina Port was dismantled and rebuilt on the south side of the new pitch.The new era for Dundee Football Club started on August , , with , spectators and £-s-d – around £, today # taken at the gate.President Robertson kicked off for the visiting Edinburgh side St Bernard’s ahead of a - draw.Dundonian Fred McDiarmid made history by scoring Dundee’s first goal at Dens Park.Dens Park has been the scene of many happy memories for a great many people in its  year history.The ground has hosted a European Cup semi-final between the Dark Blues and AC Milan, a Fairs Cup semi-final with Leeds the visitors, three internationals between Scotland and Wales in ,  and  as well as two League Cup Finals in  and .Those were some of the great occasions but what does it mean to fans who have been heading through the turnstiles week after week, year after year Tele reader Malcolm Stewart has fond memories of watching Dave Curlett, Shug Reid, Jimmy Gabriel, Alan Cousin, Doug Cowie and many more in his early days at Dens.He said: “My first memory of going to Dens Park was when I was eight-years-old, so that would be . I went with my grandfather who had been supporting Dundee way before then.“My grandfather would take me to the Provie Road end but I was in the Main Stand for the big European games and that’s where I go now, too.  That stand has barely changed since!“I have a lot of memories about the  team, I was at Muirton for the league win. I think about half a million people say they were but I certainly was!“That team was outstanding and there was hardly ever any space anywhere in the stands in those days.“The TC Keay and Provie Road ends were open then of course, not the stands like they are now and there was an incredible atmosphere at Dens.“My favourite player was Charlie Cooke, he was something . He was later on after the European games and was only around for a couple of years but he was my favourite.“There have been plenty of good memories for me at Dens Park. Goodness knows what it will be like next season but I hope there are more to come.”The Main Stand at Dens, unique in its angled shape, will next year look back over a century of Dundee goals, moans and celebrations.Built in  by Archibald Leitch, whose other works include Old Trafford, Anfield, Goodison, Highbury, Hampden, Ibrox and Tynecastle among many more, the ‘bend’ in the middle was designed to ensure a great viewing angle whether watching from the middle or the ends of the stands.Just  years after almost being wound up, Dundee were making their presence in Scottish football felt.Price added: “The building of the stand in  was such an ambitious move. That showed from being almost liquidated  years previously and given a reprieve from the league to building one of the best stands in the country.”Thirty-two years later and the Main Stand, along with the other three sides were filled to the brim.A record , fans piled into the stadium to see a Scottish Cup second-round tie between the Dark Blues and Rangers.The Glasgow side would win - that day and go on to lt the cup as well as the ‘A’ Division title, as it was known then.The massive crowds wouldagain in the early s as the greatest Dundee team of all time celebrated their league success in  with a European adventure.Twenty-five thousand saw a Gilzean hat-trick as Bob Shankly’s Dark Blues thumped FC Cologne -, , saw another treble from Gilzean in a - victory over Sporting Lisbon and then just under , were there to see Alan Cousin and Gordon Smith see off Belgians Anderlecht in the quarter-final.Among those , was a young Norrie Price. He recalls: “I was there for what would be one of the top half-dozen attendances in what was only my second time at Dens at the age of .“Anderlecht with just short of , people at Dens Park was one of the greatest experiences of my le.“Anderlecht were a fabulous team as well, had just beaten Real Madrid. For the first  minutes it was just non-stop Anderlecht passing. Under the floodlights they had this white and mauve strip and played fabulous football. I was thinking ‘gosh, Dundee can’t get a hold of the ball!’“The experienced players helped and in the second half turned the game.“It was a fantastic atmosphere, electric. You could see puffs of smoke coming from supporters all over the ground whether the breath in the night air or cigarettes. There were lights all around the ground.“Big crowds have a le of their own and it absolutely hooked me forever.“First of all, just going to the game. It had been talked about for weeks. The newspapers were fantastic, had been talking about the game for ages and there were real souvenirs made.“Even now I have fabulous memories of all the build-up.”Gilzean would net nine times in that European run to the last four, stopped only by AC Milan, and scored a record  goals for Dundee.“Gilzean was my favourite,” added Price.“We used to pretend to be all the dferent players, Andy Penman, Alan Cousin, Alan Gilzean. Everyone wanted to be Gilzean because he scored the goals.“He had a tremendous burst of pace and would often be on the halfway line with teams trying to play offside.“It was a great team and the interchanging of passing was great to behold. You look at that era and there were so many heroes. Today the best teams have maybe three or four the kids like to pick out but it doesn’t happen so much now.“That night against Anderlecht it was Smith that made the dference, he transferred the ball from one foot to the other and wandered past the full-back and put it across for Penman. It was a goal out of nothing.”The Ibrox disaster of  saw regulations brought in and the days of huge crowds were over. Bench seats were installed which brought the capacity down from more than , to ,.Further improvements in fan safety saw that reduced even further during the s.Then , packed out the new-look Dens Park in December  as the eyes of the entire country were focused on the home of Dundee Football Club.For the second time in two years, the Scottish League Cup would be decided at Dens. This time the Dark Blues would be playing after rivals Dundee United had defeated Aberdeen in a replay of the - final the year before.The Tangerines were back to defend their trophy in what would be an all-Dundee affair, even referee Bob Valentine was local.Former Dark Blues inside forward Jim McLean, who turned out  times for the club, was in charge of United and leading them to their own glory days.Dundee were very much the underdogs, battling for promotion to the Premier Division, with United enjoying European football for the fourth-straight season.A first-half goal from Davie Dodds was added to by Paul Sturrock’s second-half brace as the Tangerines ran out - winners and lted the cup at the home of their rivals.Come the end of the campaign, it would be more cheerful for home fans at Dens Park with promotion secured at East Stirling thanks to an Eric Sinclair goal.Dundee historian Kenny Ross remembers that time as he began his love affair with the club.He said: “One of my early memories was in the run up to promotion in  .“I didn’t get to go to the League Cup Final in  at Dens, we couldn’t get tickets. My dad queued up but the shutters went up and we ended up watching it from the top of the Law with hundreds of others, from both sides, with the car radios on. It was packed up there. It was amazing.“Later that season, I remember going to a game against Berwick Rangers in March and being in the Stand Enclosure swinging my legs on the barriers! I think it finished - which tells you why I was doing that.“Myself and my dad then moved to the Provost Road end and watched games from the Bobby Cox until I started doing some of the media stuff for the club where I’m now at the back of the Main Stand.”He added: “There were , at that cup final. The last time the gates were shut were for a Skol Cup quarter-final, again against United, in  where , watched. The queues were horrendous that night before the gates closed.“The day Hearts lost the league at Dens in  was just under , and there were , in the ground when United won the league three years earlier.“The last time it was sold out was for the Championship win in  – that was a total sell-out against Dumbarton.”The next major changes came at the tail end of the th century with promotion to the top flight in  dependant on the redevelopment of Dens Park.Up came two near-identical stands at either end of the ground in record time, just  days, to meet the SPL’s required seating capacity.The Bob Shankly and Bobby Cox stands popped up and Dens Park as we recognise it today emerged into the new century.Along with the new millennium came glitz and glamour with the Bonetti revolution.Club stalwarts like Barry Smith and Gavin Rae were joined by Argentine great Caniggia and the likes of Georgi Nemsadze, Fabian Caballero and Juan Sara to boost the average home gate to ,.Fans would also see a Champions League winner in Fabrizio Ravanelli and English Premier League star Temuri Ketsbaia turn out in dark blue at Dens Park before administration hit.Supporters once more stepped in to help save the club in  through another administration, just like they did  years before.Fast forward seven years and owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms revealed plans for a new stadium to take Dundee from Dens Park to a new home at Camperdown Park.Initial hopes were that would be ready for the start of the   campaign but funding issues and a global pandemic have delayed the first spade in the ground at ‘New Campy’, the fans’ name for the potential new ground.Whenever that might arrive to replace Dens, fans will continue to flock to their club’s home of  years.However, the next home match, a League Cup clash with Forfar on October , will be a competitive match like no other at the old ground.Depending on government guidelines at the time when the new season starts, there could be no fans there for a competitive fixture. At the very least there will be social distancing measures in place to combat spread of coronavirus.The days of , at Dens Park may be gone but that won’t stop thousands still wanting to get their fix of football from the Main Stand, South Enclosure, Bobby Cox or Bob Shankly.“It’s almost a marker for your year, when the first game at Dens is,” Price added.“We were looking forward to the better weather and the play-offs earlier this year but they didn’t happen. Reality kicked in and everyone was aware how dangerous a situation it is for everyone now.“When you see football where kicking off, you do feel left out. This situation shows just how much we take for granted.”Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history\" title\"#Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-andrew-nelson-jim-mcintyre-james-mcpake embed # secretONRAQjKlL\" data-secret\"ONRAQjKlL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Football with fans is what it’s all about.“It will be terric to get supporters back and I am really looking forward to getting back to having them in the stadium backing us.“Common sense will tell you that in order for football clubs to grow you need finances and part of that is getting fans through the door.“So I would imagine it will have a positive impact on that front but, as a manager, it’s about having that backing from the stands.”With impeccable timing, Mellon revealed he himself had been unable to attend a game – Tuesday’s Champions League qualying tie between the Hoops and KR Reykjavik at Celtic Park on Tuesday night.He wanted to see Neil Lennon’s men in the flesh ahead of their league clash but Mellon explained: “We tried to get into the Celtic game but we couldn’t get tickets.“Celtic told us Uefa are not allowing anyone in to watch the games.“But with the technology you have now we have been able to watch all the games they have had recently.”Mellon witnessed, albeit virtually, that - thrashing of the Icelandic team and knows this is the greatest challenge his players will have faced since stepping up from the Championship.He said: “Whenever you play the champions in any country you know the challenge will be a big one.“But it is something you want to be involved in and get excited about.“We will be encouraging the players to get involved in all games so this is an opportunity to play in a fantastic game against the champions.“It is all positive because it gives us a chance to see where we are as a club and go attack it.“We believe we can make a positive impact – that is what we are in the Premiership for.“Given the size of this football club, that is what we should we doing. That is what the fans and the owners of the club expect.”The Tangerines have impressed in the way they have nullied threats from their opponents thus far, with Motherwell and Hibs in particular struggling to make headway against a solid midfield.This test is on another level but Mellon said: “We will be trying to find a way to make it dficult for Celtic. Every team has strengths and weaknesses, so we have to get an awful lot right on the day to get a result against Celtic.“But this is football and you always have a chance.”Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretJTZmAXcxG\" data-secret\"JTZmAXcxG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The vehicle was in the Premier Inn car park and given his presentation and the smell of alcohol, they were under the impression that he was under the influence.”Ovenstone was taken to police headquarters just before am where he refused to provide two specimens of breath.He stated: “If you hadn’t treated me like crap I wouldn’t be so disrespectful.”Appearing from custody, Ovenstone pleaded guilty to breaching his curfew by being out with his home after pm and before am and refusing to provide the specimens of breath.Defence solicitor Paul Parker-Smith said Ovenstone and his cousin had been drinking the previous evening when they became “hungry”.Mr Parker-Smith said: “It seemed to have gone well in the sense that he was served.“He realised he may have been over the limit and took the foolish decision to refuse a specimen of breath.”Sherf George Way deferred sentence on Ovenstone for reports to be prepared and disqualied him from driving on an interim basis. He was released on bail.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Wait ages for one and suddenly three turn up at once.The three were also available for yesterday#s home victory against Livingston.Just  hours after completing a loan move from Bristol City, attacker Marley Watkins was thrown in at the deep end leading the line.Striker Bruce Anderson, unavailable for the Perth clash, was also back.Then there was a further boost just minutes before kick-off, with Curtis Main added to the squad when Craig Bryson felt his calf in the warm-up.Main had been out since knee surgery in the summer and also suffered a thigh strain during his rehabilitation.His appearance off the bench against Liv surely gives McInnes the option of going with two up top against NSI Runavik.New signing Marley Watkins was thrown straight into the action at Pittodrie just  hours after completing his loan move from Bristol City.Welsh international Watkins # who can also be played out wide # has had just  minutes of action since January, but he looked sharp and fast while leading the attack.On the basis of this debut, he can deliver goals and assists for Aberdeen. He was only denied a debut goal yesterday because of a brilliant double block from Livi keeper Robbie McCrorie.The stopper is the twin brother of Reds midfielder-defender Ross McCrorie.Aberdeen’s last appearance at Pittodrie was initially a cause for celebration as football ed to the stadium for the first time in more than five months due to the Covid- pandemic.It quickly turned sour with a turgid performance in a - loss to Rangers followed by the actions of the Aberdeen eight in attending a busy city centre bar on the night of that defeat.That plunged the Reds’ season into early chaos, but with two straight wins # away at St Johnstone and at home against Livi # they are getting it back on track, although there could be a further setback with the SFA serving notices of complaint to the eight players.They could be hit with bans of between two to eight games at Friday’s principle hearing.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

In the courtyard, Saoirse Amira Anisrsquo ldquoWe can still dance, a powerful work commissioned as part of the Black Lives Matter Scottish Mural Trail.ldquoThe exhibition would have been markedly dferent, more institutional perhaps,the lockdown hadnrsquot happened, says curator Claire Feeley. Liversidge had been going to concentrate on Brexit, but Covid changed that.And yet it has all come together remarkably well, and a testament to the unique working conditions in which the artists found themselves in these last few months.Feeley tells me that Kaprow taught throughout his career, ldquoand most of what we consider his artworks were mainly done with students. The main thing he was interested in was giving a simple set of instructions, which could remain as ideas or proposals, and seem at face value simple and succinct, but then the real world hits, and when people try to follow his instructions, the problems of organisation are part of the piece. The only people who experience the happenings are the people making them themselves!Kaprow had been allowing other artists to reinvent his work since relatively early in his career, and these are the latest reincarnations.The first artwork greets you at the entrance gate, or more accurately smothers it, a barrage of Thank Yous painted by Wilsons during lockdown at the behest of Peter Liversidge. Liversidge has reworked Allan Kaprowrsquos Out Exit piece, originally created by Kaprow for Edinburgh in . The signs, brightly painted, make the entrance look like a maximised incarnation of the thank yous and rainbows placed in windows around the country over the last few months. The Wilsons have also recreated the artistrsquos Yard , blocking off their own driveway with a wall of used tyres.Liversidge, with his ldquoProposals, many of which are never carried out, is a fine fit for Kaprow, who suggested lsquohappeningsrsquo in similar vein. His ideas were off-centre, humorous, an interruption of daily le, call it what you will. In the Steadings gallery, the upper level has been cordoned off for a sign painter in Liversidgersquos reinvention of Kaprowrsquos only UK happening. There is a book provided, from which you can pick a legend to be painted on a cardboard sign to take away ndash a donation is suggested.The phrases are all taken from the words of students from around the country, part of Jupiterrsquos Youth Council, whom Liversidge spoke with prior to and during lockdown, to listen to their thoughts and concerns. From ldquoDoes the hawk see us too  to ldquoThe sound of the wind in the pines, each phrase a skein of a le that thought it during lockdown, a human concern, packed in amongst many.Upstairs in the Tin Roof Gallery, Cinzia Mutigli has created a piece that takes its inspiration from Sweet Wall, Kaprowrsquos  ldquopolitical parody, as he called it, in which he built a concrete wall, joined together with slabs of bread and jam, on a piece of wasteland near the Berlin Wall.Mutiglirsquos work, which comes closest, as Feeley points out, to fulfilling the idea of a reinvention, deals in sugar and postcolonial identity, the film an overload of words and ideas and patterns repeated over and over, sledgehammer-like, as the viewer sits and watches in the repeat-pattern wallpapered room, whilst munching Mutiglirsquos homemade jam sandwiches.Itrsquos an overwhelming piece, and one which is very personal, in that lockdown has made this film largely of the artist, the narrative a mix of personal experience and ldquoexpert analysis, each filtering in and out of comprehensibility.In the Ballroom Gallery, James Hoff, based in New York, has used a short recording made by Kaprow on how to make a happening, broadcast it to a number of radios and made up thousands of copies of original posters Kaprow made to advertise his happenings, for visitors to take away free.They are also available in art bookshops across Scotlandfor those who cannot travel to Jupiter.

There is the work of RBGE taxonomist Dr Peter Wilkie, on natural plastic from the tropical tree family, Sapotaceae, and Carla Edwardsrsquo Miscellany, a series of forms made from gutta percha, an early ldquonatural plastic. Lorna Wilsonrsquos beautul Lichen Wallis an homage to clean air lichens made ndash ironically and deliberately ndash from recycled fridges, whilst Carol Sinclairrsquos floating mobile, made from dferent plastics, is an investigation into the use and reuse of recyclable plastics. There are also ldquogreen plastics created by the University of Edinburgh ndash a nascent area of research ndash used by artists in the exhibition.What emerges, amongst many things, is that plastic is more valuable than our throwaway culture deems it, but onlyit is seen as a reuseable resource . The paradox of the whole is seen in Lorna Fraserrsquos Parasol Fungi, pictured, glass-like, made from recycled water bottles, which reflect that same air of beauty and menace found in the curious forms of nature, and in the nature of the manmade material which has been used to create these strange, delicate forms.Think Plastic: Materials and Making, Royal Botanic Garden of Edinburgh, John Hope Gateway, Arboretum Place, Edinburgh,   , www.rbge.org.uk Until  Nov, Daily, am-pmDONT MISSCreated entirely during lockdown, An Lanntairrsquos inspired Sketchbook Project has been created with  of the islandrsquos residents, all of whom were sent a sketchbook by the gallery, with daily email prompts for drawing.

Signicant proposed changes include enabling the children involved to express their views and changing the way these views are obtained.But unless an amendment from Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur is agreed in tomorrows debate, a key opportunity will be missed to improve the chances that children will remain equally involved with both of their parents. The vast majority of research around the world concludes that equal time or close to it has enduring benefits for the children in separated families.Mr McArthurrsquos amendment introduces a factor into court hearings that has already been successful in other progressive countries. On the request of one of the parents, the sherf hearing a court case will have to consider whether children should spend approximately equal time with each of their parents.The amendment doesnrsquot force the court to order shared care. It doesnrsquot bind the hands of a sherf or undermine the overweening principle that the sherf will put the interests of the children first. It does mean thatthere are two safe, competent, loving parents both will have the opportunity to make their case for sharing the parenting responsibilities. It creates a dferent starting point for the decision from the winner-takes-all competition we currently have in Scotland.A similar law has been in force in Belgium since . It has reduced the number of such disputes that have to be brought to court. According to Belgian family judge Marie-France Carlier, ldquothere has been a huge reduction of parental conflict in the courts as parents now know what the law says. After separation, lots of them immediately decide to set up joint physical custody before having any court decision. A change in culture has gone hand in hand with a change in the law.Only about  per cent of Belgian decisions are for a : split with around % of remaining decisions for semi-equal care, with the children spending at least five days per fortnight with one parent.Usually it is the father who ends up with less time, but this still means he can be fully involved in weekday care ndash not relegated to the visiting role of a ldquoweekend dad. If the court considers that children will not benefit from full involvement of both parents it can order whatever contact pattern is best for them.Underpinning Mr McArthurrsquos amendment is an acceptance that the current system is expensive, unpredictable and inconsistent between courts and between sherfs. It has too many disincentives to cooperation between parents at a time when they need help to make things as easy as possible for their children, not a system that encourages them to criticise each other to win time with their kids.We have heard sherfs say from the bench ndash even before hearing arguments ndash that shared parenting never works. Of course sherfs also know they never see the successes. Only the failures come back before them.Politicians in countries such as Portugal, Greece and Brazil are currently considering whether to make similar changes in their family law.

The fact that the current First Minister has known it all along and, even worse, the civil service people dragooned into writing and supporting it knew it, is for me a much bigger scandal than what Alex Salmond got up to or Nicola Sturgeons involvement was.The deception and hype from Mr Salmond and his team bloated the Yes result from  per cent at the start to % and have fuelled all the ision, scandal, ridiculous parades and border patrols, neglected government and ravaging uncertainty ever since.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.I WAS stunned by the blatant bias in the documentary The Trial Of Alex Salmond ,which was yet more evidence that the BBC is no longer capable of impartial reporting and that is a tragedy, given its deserved worldwide reputation. It does not augur well for its coverage of a likely second Scottish independence referendum in the near future. Kirsty Wark is a friend of prominent Labour politicians and has holidayed with a former First Minister, Jack McConnell.The documentary bore all the hallmarks of one in production in anticipation of a very dferent verdict which, perhaps, Ms Wark craved. Thirteen High Court jurors, who had heard hours of evidence, it must be remembered, decided that Mr Salmond was not guilty, despite the prosecution having the top QC from the Crown Office. This documentary seemed to fail to grasp this. Why was it even broadcast at the very time the Holyrood inquiry began This whole episode was shameful and I am saddened more than angry. The BBC follows an agenda these days whether it be Brexit, the EU, President Trump, Boris Johnson, Channel migrants, BLM, LGBT, the police, racism, Extinction Rebellion and more. Nothing figures more prominently in that agenda than the preservation of the Union of The United Kingdom. Was this documentary another salvo in that war John V Lloyd, Inverkeithing.GIVE TEACHERS A MORE PROMINENT ROLE IN REVIEWI AGREE with Denis Brucethat the Governments U-turn on exam results was political: youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds protesting about unfair treatment was not good \"optics\" for the SNP. Speaking as a teacher though, its been disappointing that much of the focus since seems to have been political: \"get that man out of his job\".I had hoped for a wider debate about how we examine our young people the SQAs methods of assessment are much the same as they were for the grandparents of those protesting. In my own subject,  per cent of a students award is determined by a - minute, hand-written exam. A year or two of learning boiling down to that May morning in the exam hall. Its time to look at alternatives.Within the review of SQA procedures, serious consideration should be given into allowing teacher judgment to take a more prominent role. As a matter of course, teachers regularly assess their pupilsto check understanding and progress. Grading of these assessments by teachers could be combined with the SQAs traditional assessment methods to produce a final mark. This would lower the stakes of the end-of-year exam as well as encourage more pupils to engage throughout the academic year, rather than cram at the last minute.Callum Mitchell, Largs.DENIS Bruce is lavish in his criticism of John Swinney, but in writing that Mr Swinney \"has succeeded in ramping up grade inflation, leaving employers and higher institutions wondering whether some of the results are worth the paper they are written on\", he is also insulting the intelligence and professionalism of teachers, employers and those working within the higher institutions.Given all the stramash regarding the grades awarded to young people south of the Border, questions must arise over the intelligence of their Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who might have been expected to learn from and quickly follow Mr Swinneys example, but no Mr Williamson agonisingly strung things along until finally capitulating and executing his U-turn. UK politicians are iniably ignorant about what is happening in Scotland, but perhaps next time Mr Williamson should pay attention he might learn something.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NOW that the dust is beginning to settle over the intensely emotional furore over the now notorious algorithmic effect upon exam results, this may well be the right time to reflect rationally upon the purpose of exams for the inidual and the community.For the inidual, an exam tests the competency of the inidual in that area under examination.The result in the exam shows whether the inidual has the capacity to proceed further in that direction, needs to put more effort in to improve in that subject,the inidual wishes to continue with that line, or to seek another area more in keeping with the iniduals talents.For the community which depends upon the ranking order of exam results, such asemployers and higher institutions, exam results provide the opportunity to select those who are best placed to meet the challenges their selection places upon them.To ensure that the results carry credibility, there needs to be a quality control agency to validate nationally the standards of the certicates.If the exams do not produce a satisfactory range of results, their validity would be questionable.Grade inflation comes into that category, posing the question: \"Are the exams too easy, are the examinees cleverer or are the teachers today more effective than their predecessors  \"Ask yourself which of those three sides you would come down upon and you will be well on your way to find out how you would react to another such fiasco as the one we have just experienced.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.ACROSS Scotland this past week schools were being closed down amid new outbreaks of Covid-.If we had taken the time during lockdown and during the summer holidays to devise a system of national lesson plans, with a standard national lesson delivered on the same subject at the same time on the same day to the same age group, wouldnt we now be in a position to broadcast these lessons to pupils stuck at home through digital TV  What is so hard about putting lessons on the telly  Wasnt the Open University broadcasting lectures back in the s when we only had three black and white TV channels Nigel Boddy, Darlington.TIME TO TACKLE THE TAKEAWAY CULTUREWHAT a brilliant feature by Joanna Blythman . She is right on the money saying that ultra processed food is the biggest killer. We have become a nation of people that live on takeaways. There is something seriously wrong with society when an advert on tv says that everyonersquos favourite restaurants are back on Deliveroo, meaning Burger King, McDonalds and KFC. Seriously, is that what we aspire to, getting a takeaway from them as our main meal of the day. Thatrsquos why we have an obesity problem in this country, people have become so lazy that they just sit on their phone and click Deliveroo. If more people cooked from scratch with properly sourced produce they would see that it is a lot cheaper and healthier.

Is it any wonder we have so many health problems with our younger generation in Scotland Mauro Benedetti, Kilmarnock.IMMIGRATION: PREVENTION IS THE ANSWERPRITI Patel wants to stop immigrants because she, like so many people, is treating them as statistics and forgetting they, like herself, are people. The fact that these are ordinary people fleeing from corrupt governments, persecution, brutal attacks and wrongful imprisonment and much more seems to be of no consequence to her.The handling of people sympathetically seems to have been forgotten by governments and businesses. One of the fundamental principles of any person of stature should be \"to do unto others as we would have them do unto us and to be mercul, just and pure\".It is too late when the people have left their oppressive regimes. Governments across the world should join together to take action against these oppressors and forget national interests and stand up to big business who only look at their profit motives.Prevention of the problem arising is the only way to deal with the situation: it is too late to attempt to solve the problem when the people arrive on our shores.Ian Turner, Bearsden.YOUR correspondent Clark Crossin his proposalof a solution for the \"immigrant problem\" ndash to ban all imports from France and suggest that British holidaymakers avoid France ndash is, like the Prime Minister, ignoring inconvenient facts.

Harold Wilsonrsquos Labour Government then set up a Royal Commission on the UK constitution in , recommending a devolved Scottish Assembly which was never implemented.The Scottish Constitutional Convention was formed in , comprised of representatives from local government, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Small Business Federation, the Church of Scotland and all political parties except the Conservatives, in an effort to devise a scheme for the formation of a devolution settlement. The SNP chose to withdraw from the convention as independence was not a constitutional option, and it subsequently collapsed.Ultimately in  the Labour Government under Tony Blair promised the creation of devolved institutions and a referendum was held later that year and the Scottish Parliament was re-created as a result of the Scotland Act of . Mr Blair therefore was instrumental in firing the starting pistol on the final stretch of the road towards Scottish independence by establishing devolution in an effort to silence the SNP for several generations.When a new state of the art parliament building was built, with many devolved powers granted and a large clutch of MSPs in situ a complete parliamentary machine was gted to the SNP on a plate. The only fly in the ointment is Boris Johnson, who resolutely refuses to grant a Section  order, not to mention the many compelling arguments against the breakup of the Union. On the other hand the BBC has contributed to the recent rise in support for independence by affording Nicola Sturgeon a  to grandstand on national television almost every day for the past five months. I donrsquot blame her for jumping at the chance to place the SNP firmly in front of the nation by leading these sessions and it is plain for all to see that she enjoys basking in the limelight. We all need to be briefed on developments in respect of Covid- but a short bulletin a couple of times per week would suffice.Nevertheless it has taken  years for the SNP fortunes to reach the point where independence could be imminent and it is high time for the Unionists to wake up and become more vocal before the May Holyrood elections precipitate a landslide into oblivion.Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.UK press and media cite Business for Scotland Panelbase and Times YouGov August  poll figures respectively of  per cent and % support for Scottish independence. These figures exclude Donrsquot Knows and are partial, inflated \"headline figures\" that provide a basis for misleading reporting.Actual Panelbase and YouGov poll figures respectively show For % and %, Against % and %, Donrsquot Knows % and % . These produce simple averages of For .%, Against .%, Donrsquot Knows %.Support for independence has been rising over , is clearly higher than for remaining within the UK and lies around % . However, whether or not there is majority support for independence is not proven and there has not yet been sustained majority support over a period of time demonstrated for independence. There is therefore no convincing opinion poll case at present to support a second independence referendum. Nor has there been any reversal of the  Referendum   result, contrary to the misleading statement by Business for Scotland .Use of actual poll figures including Donrsquot Knows at the \"headline level\" are essential for objective use of statistics and balance of reporting.Whether or not the Panelbase poll of a % majority for independence continues to be reflected across dferent polls and strengthens over a sustained period of time is an issue, though so also is what happens to the Donrsquot Knows.The level of support for Scotland remaining within the UK has fallen signicantly since  at currently .% , a reflection of Scottish views on Brexit and Conservative governments since  the success of the SNP and First Minister on public perceptions of performance and confusion over UK and Scottish government responsibilities.Dont Knows might well be expected though to vote for the status quo given financial uncertainties and risks. YouGov states \"polling has shown % think the country would be worse off economicallyindependent, compared to % who think better off\". Adding together the above averaged Against and Dont Knows would produce a . .% result against Scottish independence. This is an uncertain proposition that could only be tested in a referendum, but is as much a reasonable proposition for consideration and debate as using partial inflated   and   figures that exclude Donrsquot Knows.John Garrity, Chichester.PETER A Russells concern for Alex Salmond and Scotlands justice systemhas a hollow ring to it, but I agree thatthere was a plot to have Mr Salmond thrown into jail for crimes he did not commit, it is certainly a most serious matter. Surely,anyone has evidence of such a thing the correct procedure would be to immediately contact the police, as the withholding of evidence is also a serious crime.However, I strongly suspect that, in the first place, there is no evidence because there was no plot, and in the second place, that Mr Russells demand for justice to be done is more to do with the latest opinion poll, showing support for Scottish independence now standing at  per cent, rather than any real concern for Mr Salmond and the justice system.Ruth Marr, Stirling.It is touching to witness Peter A Russells eagerness to see Alex Salmond obtain justice for himself and Scotlands criminal justice system. In support, he cites the observations of another two of yesterdays men, Jim Sillars and Kenny MacAskill.I am afraid that the latter lost a lot of my respect due to his handling of the Al-Megrahi situation. Dr Jim Swire tirelessly pursued the need for a review of the case providing evidence of several flaws in the trial in the Hague carried out under the jurisdiction of the Scottish justice system. Mr MacAskill refused to accept that there was any doubt as to Al-Megrahis guilt and he defended the Crown Prosecution services evidence virtually without question. Thereafter, he could not arrange the transfer of the convicted man to Libya quickly enough. This may well have been the start of the downturn of his own political career.It saddens me that Mr Salmond and the others cannot accept their diminished influence in the SNP and appear intent on undermining the cause of independence that they have worked so hard to deliver. The former party leader has been cleared of all charges against him even though his reputation has been tarnished by some of his own admissions during the trial. He has little to gain from washing any dirty linen in public, an outcome which Mr Russell is clearly hoping will damage the cause of independence which he hates so much.Gordon Evans, Burnside.I PREFACE my comments by saying there is no acceptable level for crimes against the person including sexual assault and rape. However, itrsquos appalling and a sad indictment of pathetic state of the opposition at Holyrood that Tory MSPS Liam Kerr would attempt to make political capital out of a blip in Julyrsquos sexual crime statistics . When taken in conjunction with the previous three months the levels of sexual crimes are actually substantially reduced.If Mr Kerr believes Police Scotland is underfunded then perhaps he could do something constructive and ask his masters in Westminster to increase the Block Grant after all what Westminster begrudgingly gives Holyrood to run the country is less than half the revenue generated in Scotland.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ON Friday Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard delivered a keynote speech, unveiling plans to transform the Scottish economy.

A comprehensive revaluation should be set in hand which would give the basis both for a fairer property tax and for a land value tax, both to be introduced within five years. Local authorities should also be permitted a wider range of local taxes, which could include a tourist tax and workplace parking levies. Community councils should be enabled as of right to levy a small precept on the council tax instead of being dependent on local authority handouts. The balance of council income would come from the Scottish Government, which controls income tax levels, and would be at a iable level so that richer areas would receive less per head of population than poorer areas.This approach, primarily taxing land, property and income, would mean that Scotland could have a fairer and more progressive taxation system even within the constraints laid down by Westminster.David Mumford, Dunbar.NOT SO GREENYOU report on SSE Renewable`s new Viking wind farm near Shetland.

Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV- may persist in the global human population as is the case for other common-cold associated human coronaviruses, evenpatients have acquired immunity via natural infection.ldquoSince the immunity can be short lasting after natural infection, vaccination should also be considered for those with one episode of infection.ldquoPatients with previous Covid- infection should also comply with epidemiological control measures such as universal masking and social distancing.The scientists add that, as immunity may be short-lasting, any vaccine should be administered to everyone, including those who have already been infected.If the research, published in the medical journalClinical Infectious Diseases, is correct it means thatherd immunity is ldquounlikely to be able to eliminate Covid-, and it will probably ldquocontinue to circulate through the population as ldquoseasonal coronaviruses do.Furthermore, they recommend that even those who have recovered from Covid-, and so are assumed to be unable to transmit the virus, should ldquocomply with epidemiological control measures such as universal masking and social distancing.:Coronavirus LIVE: Face coverings set to become mandatory in high school corridorsResponding to the study on Twitter, Yale School of Medicines Professor Akiko Iwasaki wrote: \"Kudos to the scientists for this study.

True, le expectancy in the UK has increased steadily for decades, though the Office for National Statistics points out that it has signicantly levelled off since .And the current pandemic has jolted us all into a new sense of urgency, with increasing numbers deciding to make a will ndash a rise accompanied by a new interest in the power of attorney, which anticipates the possibility that someone, for reasons of age or health, may have to allow another to deal with their affairs.Scott Ewart, managing partner at Glasgow-based legal services firm Thomas Bradley and Co, believes that granting power of attorney is arguably even more important than making a will.ldquoSomeone losing capacity without having appointed an attorney ndash someone who can formally act on their behalf ndash could end up in a terrible situation.ldquoPeople often assume that when they write a will and appoint an executor, that person ndash often one of their children ndash will deal with all those issues including power of attorney but thats not the case, he says.ldquoWe can advise them about the dference between a will, which takes care of your affairs after you have passed away and a power of attorney that ensures your affairs are taken care of should you lose the capacity to manage them yourself.There are two types of power of attorney in Scotland: that relating to financial property affairs which you can decide to begin immediately or onlyyou become incapable and welfare power of attorney, which allows someone to make welfare decisions for you should you lose the capacity to make these decisions.Incapacity, Ewart points out, can affect the simplest aspects of le. ldquoPeople tend to think in terms of a crisis, such as someone being affected by Alzheimerrsquos, but power of attorney can be important for someone who is just struggling physically, he says.ldquoI think of my grandmother who at  is mentally as sharp as a tack but set up a power of attorney as through illness she simply wasnrsquot able get out to take care of basic essentials such as going to the post office for her pension. Someone may also need their son or daughter to make sure gas or electricity bills are looked after and that the shopping is done.Which means that the person granted powers of attorney must be someone you can trust implicitly ndash and someone who also feels comfortable with acting formally on anotherrsquos behalf. Some people find it dficult to discuss with a parent that they face losing capacity through an illness.\"So the right person isnrsquot just someone you trust but someone who can also handle the potential emotional stress of a being an attorney, he says.Appointing an attorney can be a sensitive matter but the person granted power can subsequently be altered. ldquoPeople can and do come to us after several years ndash and after circumstances have altered ndash to change the person in whom power of attorney resides or add someone , but most people tend to appoint their children or grandchildren, he says.ldquoAnd they try to share the responsibility between two or three people, making the person best able to deal with their affairs the primary attorney, with one or two substitutes.ldquoIf there are no substitutes in place and the principal attorney passes away or moves to another country after the person who has appointed them loses capacity then no one  can be appointed, he adds.The Office of the Public provides the registration service for powers of attorney and can help people who have no knowledge of whatrsquos involved. Ewart explains: ldquoTherersquos a lot of support for the many people who initially have no idea what to do and the OPG ensures that people who grant powers of attorney or put them in place are protected and that trust companies are doing their job properly.ldquoIt receives a one-off fee for that and is always there to give general advice on what you should or shouldnrsquot do, thoughlegal or financial advice is needed you should consult an appropriate adviser.And while itrsquos possible for an inidual to set up a power of attorney, Ewart says itrsquos a complicated process that involves solicitors and GPs ensuring that multiple documents are signed off correctly by the persons family members. ldquoEngaging a professional who can complete the process online removes the most onerous part of the exercise, making sure itrsquos dated, checked and signed off correctly and most importantly, that itrsquos registered, he says.The company has seen a signicant increase in requests for powers of attorney: ldquoItrsquos becoming a priority for more people and % to % of the people we talk to about wills every month now set up a power of attorney at the same time.He says that while this does not represent a major financial decision, many people are seeing their incomes squeezed at the moment so Thomas Bradley is currently halving its price for the service. ldquoWhile recognising that ndash like every other company ndash we must make money I feel we have an obligation not to have profits solely in mind at the moment and offer a service thatrsquos affordable.

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme. Karen Johnston, from OLA, said: “We are delighted and very honoured to give our members the opportunity to benefit from expert information and support from such a prestigious and well respected organisation.  We are looking forward to seeing how this partnership progresses and the benefits it brings to Orkney farmers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying.

Three schools did not reopen following the detection of Covid- cases.Ballyclare Secondary School will reopen on Tuesday following a deep clean and -hour incubation period while St Kevin#s Primary School and St Louise#s College, both on the Falls Road in west Belfast, also delayed their reopening following positive cases among the school community.At Bloomfield Collegiate School in east Belfast,  students in Years  and  were back while the remainder of the  enrolment and  staff will follow in the coming days. Principal Gary Greer said he was reasonably anxious ahead of reopening but delighted that the day had finally come.The girls are all very excited to be back and while there was a bit of nervousness around the new one-way system, but overall there#s a very positive feel so far. I#m delighted with the way our staff have pulled together to ensure we#re providing as safe an environment as we can, he said.I#m slightly more concerned about what happens in the family home as we have parents who are shielding and considered vulnerable so it#s really about trying to reduce the risk for them.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePrincipal Gary Greer with his pupils at Bloomfield Collegiate FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPrincipal Gary Greer with his pupils at Bloomfield CollegiateHowever some teachers have expressed concern that schools have been #rushed# into re-opening and without enough time to respond to new guidance, issued by Education Minister Peter Weir earlier this month.It recommended the formation of protective bubbles for primary school children and pupils in years - in post-primary schools, while interactions between dferent year groups of older pupils should be limited.While not mandatory for routine use by pupils, some schools have already said that they will be encouraging the wearing of face coverings when they .Jacquie White, General Secretary of the Ulster Teachers# Union, said the situation regarding protocols around Covid- in schools was still unclear.For a start, many of the measures schools undertook to get pupils back in the first place were based on plans to have % of children in schools at once.Now from next week all pupils should be back full time and we have only had limited time to assess exactly what that will mean, she said.Schools are finding that even some classrooms they had been going to use are no longer suitable given the numbers they#re now expected to see. It#s been an incredibly rushed and quick turn around, but it#s not really until the children are back that we will see how it will work as that may well throw up other issues that we haven#t even thought of yet.Ms White added: However, one of the most fundamental things we need clarity on is what should be done straight awaya child or staff member tests positive for Covid-. We need a clear and robust plan, something like a flow chart, for instance, with step by step guidance on what to do, who needs to be isolated and how long they need to be out of school and so on.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEducation Minister, Peter Weir speaks to pupils at St Joseph’s Primary School in Carryduf FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappEducation Minister, Peter Weir speaks to pupils at St Joseph’s Primary School in CarrydufMr Weir, who visited St Joseph#s Primary School in Carryduff, expressed confidence that appropriate safety measures have been put in place.

The , others include those unable to work on site or remotely, and staff on annual leave, sick leave or special leave. Most - nearly , - of these were in the Department for Communities.The Department of Finance had a £m IT budget last year.It spent an additional £m on equipping staff for home working.A spokesperson said over , laptops were purchased, along with software to support remote working including video conferencing.Mr Allister said: The number of civil servants working from home is phenomenal. I would questionit still needs to be at the level it is.With working from home on that scale, there will be costs for equipment.The point of increasing concern is the lack of urgency in getting civil servants back to the office.Mr Allister has submitted Assembly questions around civil servants# productivity while working from home.He added: In a workforce of that size, there may be some who are less eager to pull their weight outside the office.Earlier this month it emerged that Economy Minister Diane Dodds had written to the head of the Civil Service David Sterling calling for staff toto offices to boost town and city centre economies.Mrs Dodds said one of the greatest drivers of footfall in Belfast city centre would beNorthern Ireland Civil Service staff are back at work.Alison Millar, general secretary of the Nipsa trade union, said that, where possible, civil servants should work from home. She said: Not all civil servants had the ITin the initial few weeks however, over a relatively short period of time thousands of civil servants were provided with the appropriate IT to allow them to work from home.In the main the vast majority are working effectively from home using their employer-provided IT. It is not ideal. However, from a health and safety perspective Nipsa would fully support home-working given the rise in the R number, and the fact that the Executive and PHA guidance states that where you can work from home, you should continue to work from home. Home is the safest place to be at the moment.The Department of Finance said: The number of staff who can safely work within our offices has been considerably reduced to comply with social distancing, which has proven to be the most effective means of preventing the spread of the virus. Throughout this crisis, our staff have worked remotely to ensure the provision of vital services and support to a wide range of people, including those members of society and businesses impacted by Covid-. Over , laptops were purchased and associated software to support remote working including video conferencing and increased network capacity to ensure the continuation of public services including payment of benefits and other vital government services throughout the duration of the crisis. This unprecedented sht to remote working in the NICS has had the effect of enabling the workforce to be more flexible, working remotely and delivering new ways of working that has the potential in the longer term to deliver savings on office accommodation and improve productivity.

It says that actual losses to the sector here stand at £.m for the last six months alone but it warns that the figure is likely to reach double that by the end of the yearA statement says: To compound matters further, many arts organisations which rely heavily on income generated through box office, a model decimated by social distancing, are now facing a socially distanced Christmas season ahead, normally one of the most profitable times of year for the arts.The hugely popular Grand Opera House pantomime, which had been due to star May McFettridge in Goldilocks and the Three Bears, has been postponed for a year after Covid- delayed work on a massive refurbishment programme.Officials at the Millennium Forum in Derry Londonderry have also postponed their panto, Sleeping Beauty, for  months.The ACNI says it has been working closely with the Department for Communities to support arts organisation, inidual artists and freelances whose work in the creative sector has been decimated.The council says it and the Department have put together a series of emergency funding initiatives.But the ACNI warned: Short term measures now will not save the arts and entertainment infrastructure nor many of those who work within it, from artists to lighting technicians, drivers to musicians. Their work has completely disappeared and the future is uncertain.It is crucial that the arts and creative sectors are supported and sustained with further investment now and over the coming years in order to plan and deliver arts programming - programming and activities that are so important to our night time economy, to cultural tourism and to the health and wellbeing of the many iniduals most in need in our communities.The ACNI says that assistance for the arts has included: l Fty per cent of the £.m in annual core grants being paid up front to support  key arts organisations in April .l Two hundred and twenty four funding awards being made to inidual artists, totalling £,, in May June  through the Artists Emergency Programme .l The opening of the Iniduals Emergency Resilience Programmein July, worth £.m from the Department for Communities and from Future Screens NI, offering grants to iniduals working in the creative sector. l One hundred and fty funding awards being made to arts organisations, totalling £.m, through the Organisations Emergency Programme , with a second round of the programme opening soon.l The imminent opening of a capital funding programme to help arts organisations prepare for a safe reopening of venues and performance spaces.The ACNI has already said it is continuing to press government for parity of esteem in public investment in the arts here, to close the gap on spending per head of the population in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic.Last week Game of Thrones and Derry Girls star Ian McElhinney called for more government and ACNI backing for struggling actors and technicians and said he hoped funds would be directed at professionals in the industry rather than being erted to community projects.

Iniduals receive immediate support forgoing the need to attend a busy hospital Emergency Department. They are also directed to additional support servicesnecessary. An independent Ulster University report found the service to be cost-effective. Figures released by the Western Trust demonstrate the need for enhanced mental health provision in the city. googletag.cmd.push At the end of June  people were waiting more than nine weeks to access adult mental health services. There were  young people waiting more than nine weeks to access child and adolescent mental health services , as of June . Foyle Search  Rescue has also responded to many emergency incidents in recent months despite a period of lockdown. ‘UNTHINKABLE’ Karen Mullan said the minister has declined requests from her and party colleagues to meet to discuss the need to fund the CCIS and mental health services in the city. She added: “Derry City and the North West area a is being neglected by the Minister and his unwillingness to invest in mental health support services. “The Community Crisis Intervention Service is a service dealing with iniduals who are facing a crisis and need de-escalation. “This crisis can be due to a mental health episode or as a result of substance misuse. “All these issues fall firmly under the remit of the Department for Health and as such the minister. “Icallon Minister Swann to provide the funding for the Intervention service and investment in mental health provision in the City.” In June the health minister visited Derry where he announced pound, of additional funding to keep the service running for three months. Mark H Durkan said it is impossible to measure the positive impact it has had and he ‘shuddered’ to think about what could have happened without it. He continued: “We were able to convince the Minister to extend funding on an interim basis. “We have to remember that tackling the mental health crisis is an Executive priority so it’s not just one for the Department of Health. “They’ve made positive noises but that has to be backed by action and for me it is unthinkable that this service wouldn’t be funded moving forward.” The Foyle MLA said it is unacceptable for service users and hard-working staff to keep getting word of short extensions and that a permanent commitment must be made. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council acknowledged that the funding provided would allow for the temporary continuation of the service. However, councillors are of the view that the Department of Health and other government departments should consider a ‘long-term funding arrangement’. In response, a DoH spokesperson said: “The additional funding provided by the Department of Health enabled Derry Crisis Intervention Service to continue until the end of September . “Correspondence from Extern has been received today requesting additional funding to support the service until the end of March . This is currently being considered. If you feel in crisis and need support oryou have observed someone who is in distress and may come to signicant harm through self-harm and suicidal behaviour please call CCIS on:    If you need to speak to someone urgently, please call Leline on   , the Samaritans or attend your local Emergency Department.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again.

Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this.

Emmet Bradley edged Glen ahead, but they lost Conor Convery to a black card after  minutes.

Connor Carville, Emmet Bradley and Jack Doherty had Glen four points clear after  minutes. Ballinderry replied with points from Conor ONeill, Matt Quinn and Sean Graham on his debut. Glen finished out the game with points from Gunningand the Doherty brothers – Alex and Jack. Magherafelt -Banagher -An early goal from Niall Higgins put champions Magherafelt on their way to victory at Banagher, to secure second in the group. The story of the game for Rossa was theof Michael McEvoy to the side, when he came in for Jared Monaghan to make his first appearance since last seasons Larkin Cup. googletag.cmd.push In the first attack of the game, Conor Kearns direct ball found Higgins, who turned inside two defenders before slotting across goalkeeper McDermott to the bottom corner of the net. Kearns came forward to kick a point from the wing, with Shane Heavron burling a fine score to help Adrian Cushs side into a - to - point by half-time, with Niall Moore among Banangers first half scorers.

Dara saw off tough competition from Paloma Faith’s other acts, Isla and Hayley, to become her representative in the final four. ”You have this amazing talent that’s technical but feels so sensitive,” said the coach. ”That feeds into the way you sing because it’s just pure beauty.” The St Colm’s High School pupil was congratulated by his family after his performance and can now look forward to the final round of the competition. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir yesterday announced a u-turn on results, with all pupils now to be given the higher of the grades submitted by their centre or the grade calculated by CCEA Over a third of all AS and A grades given to students by teachers had been originally downgraded by CCEAs standardisation system last week in a move which drew critcisim from schools, parents and pupils. One County Derry school saw  percent of its results downgraded. Their principal, who wished to remain anonymous, said the system is flawed. googletag.cmd.push “The actual child was taken out of the entire process,” they told the County Derry Post. “Education reports always say, the child is at the centre of all that we do. This system took the child out of the equation and everyone became a number and a statistic. “Nobody sat down and worked out our grades. This is an algorithim or some way of putting all the data into a computer and spewing it back out again.“No heed was paid to teachers professional judgement. the child has been taken out of the equation – and it was a mathematical equation.” The way in which schools previous performance was factored into the process had also caused controversy, with many feeling pupils at comprehensive schools are at a further disadvantage. googletag.cmd.push Having seen a dip in one particular subject the previous year, the affected school poured efforts into rectying the situation, only to see their work negated by the standardisation system. “In one subject this time last year we were devastated [with the results]. If I sat with my arms folded, we would have got the same results this year,” said the Principal. “Those who were sitting looking at our estimated grades and our AS Level grades from the bad situation, dont know what we were doing all year to turn it around. “We were moving mountains to change the situation that CCEA used for that particular subject. “Theyve used the history of subjects. Ours is a high achieving school. One year a child came to us in third year, with no English, and achieved ten A* grades. Does that mean thatthat child had been doing those exams the way they were done this year, they wouldnt have got the ten A* grades, because we had no history of that  “Theyve said, we cant give them four As in Maths, because theyve never had four As in Maths. Does that mean that every year, a child doesnt get the opportunity to get an A  “Specically with our school, they had brought our percentage to  percent. We have never, in the history of A-Levels here, got  percent. So how did they come to that conclusion ” There was criticism also of CCEAs handling of the appeal process and its associated advice. The school only received official advice on the appeals process at .pm on the evening the results came out. “I received guidance on how to write an appeal at .pm. I was at home. We walked out of here yesterday with all our appeals all done and we got that at home” said the Principal. “Nobody can explain why these people have been pulled down. They gave us a webinar on Tuesday before the results came out as a background to how theyve reached the conclusion. “You can have all the webinars you like, butyoure going to disadvantage children, Im going to be shouting, and were not the only school. “We had plenty of good results too, but its the fact that they changed so many pupils. CCEA are saying it was a third that were changed. “If they hadchanged a third of ours, I would not be on the phone to you now, but they have taken  percent of our pupils down. “They were utterly devastated. We have children who looked at a screen last week that said they were unsuccessful in their attempt to get into their university choice. “We spent two full weeks in lockdown sorting out these centre-assessed grades. We might as well not have bothered.” Related: COMMENT: Belated U-turn should have come last week  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans see new guidance released for parents and carers setting out what steps will be taken to safeguard young people when they travel, alongside simple advice on the safety actions they can also take to protect themselves and others, so everyone travels safely together. “Safety is always our top priority, saidDavid Cowan, Translink Director of Commercial Operations.  In line with the Department for Education guidelines, we have worked with EA colleagues and local schools to introduce appropriate school transport fromstSeptemberthat aims to maximise services in order to help manage the number of pupils travelling at peak times. googletag.cmd.push This will include operating extra school services ​and more ‘school only’ services, to provide increased capacity as required. “We know this will be an unsettling time for parents and for many young people it will be their first time back on public transport. Many things will look dferent with a range of safety measures now on board and in stations for everyone’s protection. “We expect that both scheduled timetabled services and dedicated ‘school only’ services will be busy at peak times andwhere possible, we encourage pupils to consider walking or cycling to and from school. “We continue to enhance our safety standards withregular deep cleaning of our vehicles and facilities using long lasting anti-viral disinfectant and our mobile cleaning teams are sanitising common touch areas. googletag.cmd.push We have protective screens in stations and on bus drivers cabs and have provided hand sanitiser in all main bus and train stations. “It is now compulsory for all pupils aged  or over to wear a face covering on public transport anditis strongly recommended that all pupils regardless of age should wear a face covering on any form of home to school transportwhere it is appropriate for them to do so. Compliance is already very high at over % and together with our wider safety measures, passenger confidence is growing. “It is important pupils also practice the wider safety and travel advice including good hand hygiene and use pre-paid tickets such as mLink or travelcards where they are not eligible for a sessional school pass. For everyone’s protection there will be no change given on board the bus and train. “We would also ask parents   carers and schools for their patience at this time as every year it takes a bit of time for the school traffic to settle into a pattern and this year is even more challenging as we work through the impact of this pandemic. “Translink has been at the frontline throughout this crisis helping get people to where they need to be and now, working together with the EA, we are ready to help get schools back up and running and get young people back into education in this ‘new normal’ and help Northern Ireland recover safely and sustainably”, David concluded.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

It develops strength and endurance. Through dancing, a toddler will learn from the early age about what their bodies are capable of, she says.ldquo At the same time, it will build their curiosity as naturally they will experiment with certain movements. If toddlers have been introduced to dancing since early age, the chance of them developing good kinesthetic memory is increased.ldquoDuring class we work on key skills such as counting and sequencing thus subtlety engaging with numeracy and literacy.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose. To their credit, Downpatrick did not throw in the towel.Caolan Mooney burst through on the Downpatrick goal not long before half-time and a penalty was awardedwhen he was up-ended by goalkeeper Deeny. Shaun Parr stepped up and netted Rostrevorrsquos third goal.Downpatrick were given a glimmer of hope just before the interval when Parr and then Sean Cooper were black-carded.However at half-time, and the score at - to -, Downpatrickrsquos task looked onerous.The RGU came out with the right attitude to mount a revival in the second half and Doylersquos early minor reduced the gap.Chris Magee helped lead the Downpatrick forward linersquos continuing assaults on the Rostrevor goal with a couple of scores. And there emerged a real feeling of optimism amongst the massed Downpatrick ranks when Conor McGradyrsquos point left just two in it.However Rostrevor refused to hit the panic button. Guided by the experience of Mooney, they stretched their lead before the next water break.Downpatrick were awarded a penalty with the scoreboard reading - to -. However when Rostrevor needed a big moment at just the right time, goalkeeper Gareth Clarke provided it, plunging to push Tim Prenterrsquos effort to safety.That was the moment which really deflated Downpatrickrsquos resolve. You sensed that Rostrevor knew they had weathered the best that Downpatrick could summon in response to their deficit.Jordan Fegan then broke away in the closing minutes, before splitting the posts and taking Rostrevorrsquos score to -.Kane applied a classy coup de grace with the final score of the evening for the victors when he spun the Downpatrick defence and, bearing down on goal, took the safe option of landing the point.In the end it looked plain sailing on paper for Rostrevor. Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

Yet for all the hoopla underpinning Sinn Fein’s our-day-will-come project their so-called ‘inevitable’ unity cannot be taken for granted. Likewise, Micheál Martin’s ‘beefed-up’ Shared Island Unit may have irked unionism a couple of weeks ago, but even he would admit that there is nothing inevitable about a united Ireland. But regular readers will know that I’m a be-ready-for-all-outcomes-and-possibilities kind of guy. I’ve said many, many times that I’m an unambiguous, unapologetic unionist and I can conceive of no circumstance in which I would swap my citizenship of the United Kingdom for citizenship of a united Ireland. That said, I’m not afraid of a debate on the subject and I have no objection to any party which wants to make the case for unity by entirely democratic means. I’m aware there are unionists who believe taking part in the debate risks conveying the impression you think unity has become a serious possibility. Yet in not taking part – or failing to even make your own case from a separate  – there’s also the risk of allowing your political opponents to gain traction. The problem, as we now know, is that once that happens it becomes very dficult to catch-up with your own counter-message and narrative, let alone gain an edge and take the lead in terms of input and impact. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Peter Robinson and Mike Nesbitt at the announcement of the subsequently short-lived Unionist Forum in January I noted in the column a couple of weeks ago that John Hume had more specic, lasting influence on successive UK governments than had any unionist equivalent. That’s because he took his case – at a time when people were barely even listening to local nationalism, because the electoral gap between unionism and non-unionism was so wide – to anyone and everyone who would open a door and incline an ear in London, Dublin, Washington or Brussels . That’s why so much of what used to be mocked by unionists as ‘Hume-speak’ found its way into government policy and subsequent political initiatives.With Northern Ireland’s centenary just around the cornerthere are a number of issues for unionists to consider. A centenary celebration will, by its very nature, focus attention on the past but it also involves surveying the presentand preparing for the future.In terms of the challenges unionists face, here are a number off the top of my head. The clash between the competing nationalisms across the United Kingdom the surge, influence and interests of a rebooted English nationalismthe rise of Scottish nationalism and Sinn Fein the combined impact of finally leaving the EU without a deal and the massive economic hit the UK has already taken from the pandemic the closing electoral gap between unionism and nationalism in Northern Ireland the rise of what can best be described as the ‘other’ demographic in Northern Ireland and how it can be kept within the pro-UK camp the outcome of an independence referendum in Scotlandand, of course, the looming shadow of a border poll .In September , at a dinner celebrating the centenary of the Ulster Covenant, Peter Robinson spoke about creating a Council for the Union to prepare for the  celebrations. Now, unless it is meeting and preparing and planning well below the radar I’m not aware of anything on the scale of which he was talking. And while it’s true that he and Mike Nesbitt jointly convened a Unionist Forum in January it is also true that it collapsed within a few months – with quite a few cross words.At this point I have no ideawhat Boris Johnson imagines will emerge from his Forum and Panel discussions. I don’t knowhe has given them a steer or an outline from which to work, orhe just intends to let them do their own thing as long as they provide him with an opportunity to do one of his rambling, hand-me-down Churchillian addresses to the nation. My fear – and it isn’t just a passing one, by the way – is that his references to Northern Ireland and ‘Ulster’ unionism will be so ambiguous and let’s-not-offend-anyone-at-all as to be utterly meaningless.In  Brian Faulkner fronted a three-day debate in the NI Parliament to mark the first half-centenary. In the absence of a unionist majority in the Assembly I’m not sure Arlene Foster would even consider such a debate. There’s no unionist majority in Belfast City Council, either so no cheerleading for the Union there. Who knows what Covid- restrictions might still be imposed upon us in the first six months of , orpublic celebrations of the Unionwill even be possible.Yet whatever happens it strikes me as essential that a united, coherent, pro-Union, pro-UKmessage is heard from unionism within Northern Ireland. Yes, we have serious challengesand issues from which we would be extraordinarily stupid to shy away but our identity, citizenship, political beliefs and sense of belonging to a pan-UK family is worth commemorating and celebrating.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I was a mere child then and childhood dreams develop realism as time moves on.The family home eventually became too small for us and we moved on, but not far away. My mother pined to get back to the area which she eventually did by which time I had left school, had started working and soon that meant living away from home except for the Christmas holidays. That was the one time of the year you could be guaranteed to escape what we called the midges or mayflies, to give them their proper title, harmless little blighters but a great nuisance. And this year, particularly this month, it seems, those mayflies are ‘torturing‘ the locals because August is the month of the mayfly andit’s a good, warm month they breed in their zillions.I remember having to close up bedroom windows at night andI went to visit my elderly Aunt Lizzie, who lived right on the shore at Ballyronan, she kept a permanently rolled up newspaper which she took everywhere with her.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Her laneway was fairly long and when I visited I always dreaded having to cycle though this buzzing throng with mouth closed and breath held until I could reach her front door.The mayflies first arrive in May but this balmy warm August, has been particularly perfect weather for the second generation of little blighters on all shores of the lough. Barbeques  Out of the question. Strolling around the shore on a calm evening  Forget it. The mayflies cover the walls of houses and the windows, for all the world resembling a black plague. My mother would spend her mornings shovelling them away from the doors and windows yes, even those that got inside. When the well-known McGarry Brothers were building boats on the shore not far from BallyronanI recall seeing the dead flies stacked high in their boatyard, the perfect dung heap for locals keen for valuable free compost for their gardens.Tennis, GAA matches, even paddling on the shore was out of the question when the flies took over.The sadness of it all is that most parts of the shores of Lough Neagh are scenically beautul and understandably people want to build homes there. Those who haven’t done their homework and have built a home overlooking the water will get a shock when the first tranche of mayflies arrive.These creatures spread themselves over everything including the highest trees. Fly killing sprays are useless. They come, set up home and don’t die off or go away until it suits them. And, it was that that persuaded me that no matter how much I loved the place I could never live there. I wasn’t even keen to visit the family home until the flies had gone.I try to avoid driving in the area when the mayflies are active as they splatter the windscreen ruining your vision and needing to be scraped off because they harden like glue. Step ouside the car and you’re covered in them.In sense they are not unlike the coronavirus – a first tranche arrives taking lives and scaring us witless. We try to get it under control only for a second lot to move in or at least we have been told to expect one. Even our scientists are fairly certain the virus willwith the cold weather. Our Health Minister Robin Swann has us well warned. So the police needed go looking for beach parties or illegal raves around the shores of Lough Neagh. The mayfly, though harmless, is a thorough pest which comes and goes as it pleases.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In a statement Ballyclare Secondary has said it will not be opening on Monday after a pupil tested positive for Covid-.The principal of Ballyclare Secondary School said the pupil had been in the school on Thursday,  August and it would reopen on Tuesday.On Friday it was announced that St Kevin’s Primary School on the Falls Road in west Belfast would not be reopening as planned after someone connected to the school tested positive for coronavirus.And St Louise’s College, also on the Falls Road, also confirmed a positive case of Covid- among the school community.Yesterday the Department of Health COVID- report revealsed that  people have tested positive in the last  hours.Earlier a statement was released from the Chief Medical Officers and Deputy Chief Medical Officers of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales on the evidence of risks and benefits to health from schools and childcare settings reopening. It says: “The current global pandemic means that there are no risk-free options, but it is important that parents and teachers understand the balance of risks to achieve the best course of action for their children.ChildrenWe are confident that multiple sources of evidence show that a lack of schooling increases inequalities, reduces the le chances of children and can exacerbate physical and mental health issues. School improves health, learning, socialisation and opportunities throughout the le course including employment. It has not been possible to reduce societal inequalities through the provision of home-based education alone. School attendance is very important for children and young people.We are confident in the extensive evidence that there is an exceptionally small risk of children of primary or secondary school age dying from COVID-. The infection fatality ratefor those aged  to  is estimated at  per million, lower than for most seasonal flu infections. Every death of a child is a tragedy but COVID- deaths in children and teenagers are fortunately extremely rare and almost all deaths are in children with signicant pre-existing health conditions.We are confident that there is clear evidence of a very low rate of severe disease in children of primary and secondary school ages compared to adults, eventhey catch COVID-. The percentage of symptomatic cases requiring hospitalisation is estimated to be .% for children aged  to  and .% among those aged  to , compared to a hospitalisation rate of over % in the UK for the general population. Most of these children make a rapid recovery.We are confident that there is clear evidence from many studies that the great majority of children and teenagers who catch COVID- have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.There is reasonable, but not yet conclusive, evidence that primary school age children have a signicantly lower rate of infection than adults .Evidence that older children and teenagers are at lower risk of catching COVID- is mixed. They are either less likely to catch COVID- than adults or have the same risk as adults.Transmission of COVID- to children in schools does occur. On current evidence it is probably not a common route of transmission. It may be lower in primary age children than secondary age children.Control measures such as hand and surface hygiene, cohorting to reduce number of daily contacts, and directional controls to reduce face-to-face contact remain key elements of maintaining COVID- secure school environments and minimising risk.Children and young people who were previously shielding were identied on a precautionary basis at a stage when we had less data on the effects of COVID- in children than we do now. Based on our better understanding of COVID- the great majority have now been advised they do not need to do so again, and that they shouldto school. A small number of children under paediatric carehave been or will be given inidual advice about any ongoing need to avoid infection.Our overall consensus is that, compared to adults, children may have a lower risk of catching COVID- , definitely have a much lower rate of hospitalisation and severe disease, and an exceptionally low risk of dying from COVID-. Very few,any, children or teenagers will come to long-term harm from COVID- due solely to attending school. This has to be set against a certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people from not attending school.Teachers, other school staff and parentsData from the UKsuggest teachers are not at increased risk of dying from COVID- compared to the general working-age population. ONS data identies teaching as a lower risk profession . International data support this.Transmission of COVID- to staff members in school does occur, and data from UK and international studies suggest it may largely be staff to staffrather than pupil to staff. This reinforces the need to maintain social distancing and good infection control inside and outside classroom settings, particularly between staff members and between older children and adults.If teachers, other school staff, parents or wider family catch COVID- their risks of severe illness are similar to those of other adults of the same age, ethnicity and health status. Younger adults have a much lower risk of severe COVID- than older adults. The greatest risk is to those over  years old.Current international evidence suggests transmission of COVID- from children of school age to parents or other adult family members is relatively rare compared to transmission from adults, but this evidence is weak. Teenagers may be more likely to transmit to adults than younger children.Children and young people should be engaged in the process of establishing COVID- secure measures as key participants and promoters of safe communities to help protect their wider families, teachers and other school staff and other social networks. This will help reduce the risk of school outbreaks.Impact of opening schools on wider transmission Because schools connect households it is likely opening schools will put some upward pressure on transmission more widely and therefore increase R. We have confidence in the current evidence that schools are much less important in the transmission of COVID- than for influenza or some other respiratory infections. Other work and social environments also increase risk and are likely to be more important for transmission of COVID-.The international real-world evidence suggests that reopening of schools has usually not been followed by a surge of COVID- in a timescale that implies schools are the principal reason for the surge. There has, however, not been sufficient time to say this with confidence.On the other hand, a local or national surge in transmission in the community may lead to an increased risk of school outbreaks occurring.Opening schools may be as important in linking households indirectly as through direct transmission in school. For example allowing parents to go back to work, or meeting at the school gates, on public transport or in shared private vehicles, via after school social or sport activities or wrap-around care may be as important as what happens within the school.It is possible that opening schools will provide enough upward pressure on R that it goes above  having previously been below it, at least in some local areas. This will require local action and could mean societal choices that weigh up the implications of imposing limitations on dferent parts of the community and the economy.Early identication and quickly managing outbreaks of COVID- in schools is essential as part of a local response to COVID-. Clear advice for pupils and staff not to attend school with symptoms, and prompt availability of testing, appropriate isolation advice, and careful public health surveillance and monitoring of educational establishments are key to support the safeto schools”._________________________________________________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
