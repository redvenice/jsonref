Nahida Khan comes in to replace her. Pakistan, conversely, got their campaign off to a poor start against old foes India, falling to a 107-run defeat at Bay Oval on Sunday, a loss that was comprehensive enough to see them fall immediately to the bottom of the fledgling eight-team table. Bismah Maroof’s side face a huge task against the world’s No 1 ODI side if they are to rise off it.

Ellyse Perry and Beth Mooney also chipped in with destructive innings. In brief, there was enough Australian batting firepower on display - along with the supreme spin of Alana King - to suggest Lanning’s juggernaut is going to be difficult to derail this year. Australia will be seeking to go top of the table with victory in Mount Maunganui today - India’s net run rate has them top, followed by South Africa and hosts New Zealand with Australia in fourth - while Pakistan are hoping to create a slice of history with their first ever win over Australia in the 50-over format of the game.

In such a climate of global gloom it is hard to stay positive.But Pricewatch is nothing if not positive.Okay, okay, Pricewatch can also be moany, tetchy, impatient and endlessly frustrated by the steady stream of stories of poor customer service and shady behaviour we get from our readers. But we try to be positive most of the time.With that in mind we thought it would be no bad thing to mark the changing of the seasons and the recent start of spring – at least from a meteorological perspective – by looking at all the ways the brighter days of ahead might save us a few bob.But do we really save money with the passing of the seasons? Well, according to one US study carried out in 2018, people in that part of the world spend at least 5 per cent less in the spring and summer than they do in the autumn and winter. Springtime is, by that account, the cheapest of the seasons.While 5 per cent is pretty significant – and would all but entirely offset the current rate of inflation in Ireland – we reckon Irish people are set to make even great seasonal savings than that.So, here are just some of the reasons to be cheerful – at least from a spending perspective – about our prospects for the months ahead.1. The spike in the cost of heating and lighting our homes in recent months has been nothing short of horrendous. Increased demand following a post-Covid economic recovery in many parts of the world as well as sudden and dramatic supply issues with gas coming from the east is to blame. The bad news is that our enduring reliance on fossil fuels and ongoing volatility on international markets means the problem is only going to get worse in the days, weeks and months ahead. But at least we should be spared the impact of some of the savage increases by our seasons in the sun – or at least our seasons without plummeting temperatures and endless grey skies.While the price hikes rolled out by providers in recent months will see the average bill for most houses climb by in excess of €800 – with some people facing increases of in excess of €1,000 – few of those price increases will be evident in the spring and summer.Based on today’s energy prices it costs about 90 cent to keep the lights on in your home each day over the course of the dark days of autumn and winter. By contrast it costs no more than 20 cent each day in the spring and summer – and on some of the brightest days it will cost you nothing at all as long as you go to bed before 11pm. Were we to split the seasons into dark and light, it means that as a result of the light season we are facing into, you will spend a not too shabby €127.40 less on lighting between now and the end of August. And there’s more savings on the table. If you keep your heating on for six hours each day in the dark season then your heating bill will be around €1,700 compared with absolutely nothing in the season of light. And – all going well – you should be able to stand down your horrendously expensive tumble dryer over the next six months which will save you another €150. You will also save yourself a few bob on your cooker as the likelihood of you feasting on casseroles and roasts at the height of summer is significantly demonised.2. Speaking of food, prices up and down our supermarket aisles have been climbing for months now and the spike in inflation will see many Irish households worse off by the tune of €700 over the course of 2022 compared with 2021. The good news – if we can call it that – is that at least in the summer time we tend to spend less on food.We can almost hearing you arching a sceptical eyebrow at that idea. But it is true. And why is that? We have our ancestors to blame – or thank. Almost as soon as those who came before us crawled out of the primordial soup they were eating more in the winter than in the summer. And they had good reason to do so. They needed to store as much fat as they could in the colder months when food was always more scarce, while in the warmer months they could afford to be more lean mean hunting machines. That is one reason we eat more in winter – although given that we have heating and access to supermarkets and the like we really don’t need to be stocking up on excess calories in the winter. Another reason is the comfort food factor. When it is cold and dark and miserable outside you want to eat things that are warm and comforting. As temperatures fall below zero has anyone anywhere ever said: “Do you know what? I really fancy a salad for dinner.” Almost certainly not.Now according to official data, the average Irish house spends about €220 a week on food. If we spend just 10 per cent less in the summer time, than in the winter time, our bills for the next six months will be €572 less than in the six months just past . . . Although all things being equal they will climb again after that because you can’t just alter tens of thousands of years of evolution in a few months.3. Pity our poor winter wardrobe. It has to work so much harder than our summer one. For starters we need to wear far more clothes in the dead of winter than we do at the height of summer. At a minimum Pricewatch will need a coat, a hat and scarf gloves, a jumper, at least one T-shirt, maybe a thermal vest, jeans, underwear and socks and boots before we will even consider leaving the house in the colder months. Added up all of these elements will cost well in excess of 300 quid. In the summer time we might get away with cheap as chips flip flops, shorts and a T-shirt which will set us back well under €100. While the costs will differ from person to person, the bottom line is the bottom line and most people will spend at least €500 less on their summer wardrobe than they will on their winter one.4. The great outdoors is rarely greater than in the summer time. Not only can a day at the beach or in a park or climbing a mountain be good for the heart and the mind it can also be very, very good for the wallet. For starters most of the outdoor pursuits open to us are free but there is more than that when it comes to money saving. A family of four eating mediocre food in a mid-priced restaurant will easily spend over €60. A picnic for the same four people can be sorted for less than a tenner. If you have just one picnic each month between now and the end of August instead of visiting a restaurant then you will save a not too shabby €300.5. Days out cost less in the spring and summer than they do in the winter and they last longer too. The cost of a trip for four people to the cinema will cost about €70 when the price of tickets and popcorn and soft drinks are totted up. A trip to the Botanic Gardens or the Phoenix Park or all manner of spots along the Atlantic Way or the Ancient East or wherever you might find yourself in the country will cost virtually nothing. Two free outdoor trips each month over the course of the next six months when you might otherwise have gone indoors for some paid for fun will see your summertime spending drop by €840.6. While we are strong supporters of cycling year round, we know it can be more of a challenge in the winter months when it is cold and wet and dark and miserable. It’s a much more attractive option in the spring and summer. And it can be a big money-saving option. How big? Well, if you commute to work and travel just 8km each way and you usually drive, then you will travel 3,760km to and from work over the course of a year. If your car has a fuel consumption rate of 9.5 litres per 100km you will use about 370 litres of fuel on that commute. If a litre of fuel costs €1.85, the cost of your car commute over the six months between now and the end of August will come in at €342.50. Assuming you have a bike at your disposal, the cost of cycling the same distance over the same period of time will be zero.7. And speaking of exercise, we are big fans of gyms – or at least we are a big fan of our gym, particularly on dark cold mornings when going for a run in the park is as appealing as sitting in a bucket of fish guts for an hour. But as the grand stretches in the evenings become ever grander, there is definitely a case for taking your workouts into the outside world. If you were in a position to suspend your gym membership for the spring and summer you could handily knock as much as €300 off your annual spending and maybe even enjoy your workouts that little bit more. It might not suit everyone but it would definitely suit some people. Following this course has the added bonus of stripping away the guilt factor you might feel after paying for a gym membership you only rarely use.8. GPs surgeries are always busier in the autumn and winter than they are in the spring and summer – and that was the case long before Covid came along and made life so much harder for all of us. If it costs €60 to visit your GP and you go three times in the dark season and just once in the light season, then already you\u0026nbspare €120 better off. Not having to spend any money on antibiotics, cough syrups and paracetamol might see your savings climb that little bit higher.9. Ho, ho ho noooo it’s Christmas. Well, it isn’t Christmas obviously. In fact there are 292 sleeps until Christmas. So why are we mentioning it? Because the season to be jolly is in the middle of winter and has done since pagan times when – in the absence of the Netflix and the like – our ancestors were desperate for something to alleviate the eternal gloom. Fast forward to now when the season is less about hedonistic dancing around open fires and slaughtering the fattest calf you can lay your hands on and more about spending money on presents and food and booze. All told few Irish households will have much change out of a grand by the time all the crackers are pulled and the champagne corks popped.10. But what about summer holidays we can hear you ask. Isn’t that a summertime cost that we don’t have in the winter? It is a fair point. But here’s the thing. January is by far the busiest time for summer holiday bookings followed by February. That means that many people will have already paid for their summer jollys so when the time comes to take them, there will be no additional costs to factor in.This brings us back to the good news at a time where almost everything we see, hear and read is so depressing. We have totted up all the cost that you might reasonably be expected to face in the six months between September and February that you don’t have to pay for between March and August and reckon that many people will be able to get through the spring and summer for almost nine grand less than it costs them to get through the autumn and winter. While savings on this scale are obviously a cause for celebration they do come with the knowledge that – all going well – higher spending will be coming down the tracks later in the year."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examMaking important life decisions is never easy - but there are tools to helpJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choice"},{"url":null,"title":"it used to be rare for a parent to disclose their child was on anxiety medication","story":"As a country we need to recognise that it is time to up our game and look at mental health through a preventative lens. Illustration: iStockThis year’s parent-teacher meetings have been different for many reasons they have been online for a start, but that has been the easiest change to accept and adapt to. Never before have parents put me under less pressure around their child’s academic performance.Until this year it was extremely rare for a parent to disclose that their child, my student, has been prescribed medication for anxiety, depression or some other mental condition. And I have never before had parents tell me that they themselves are struggling mentally. I feel truly privileged to be trusted with those insights. I also feel a responsibility to raise awareness about what is emerging as a day-to-day reality.Talk of the mental health crisis being the real pandemic is something I both welcome and recoil from. The iniduals behind all of these statistics co-exist alongside us in society every day. We teach them in our classrooms. We greet them at parent-teacher meetings. We are them. Many teachers would argue that it is hard to find ways to do more for student mental health when their own feels so fragile. During the working week, many teachers feel that they exist in survival mode.I need to remove myself from the conversations where the body language involves shrugging of shoulders and where the inevitable close will reveal defeatism. In these conversations you’ll hear “ah sure, what can you do?”, or general chastisement of Government Ministers and decisions.When it comes to mental health any form of the blame game mentality is to miss the point entirely. Each of us has a primary responsibility for our own mental health and a secondary responsibility for the mental health of those we encounter. We could go biblical and quote Matthew’s gospel, “So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you”, or philosophical by looking to Plato, “Happiness springs from doing good and helping others”.The conversations on mental health that I welcome are ones in which the focus is on doing better, raising awareness, having a positive impact in one’s own immediate context. They involve giving and providing for others in order that those who have less may have more. There is a focus on narrowing the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Conversations like this are creative, energising. They are solution-focused and inspiring. By and large the participants are those who work and mingle in the private sector.That those of us in the public sector are perceived as less industrious and primed to take rather than give angers me. When I think of all of the friends and colleagues I know who do nothing to merit any of that criticism, I feel a deep sense of sorrow and a strong desire to retaliate and defend. But then I remember how often I want to be the one throwing stones right into my own glasshouse so often I cringe at how we are represented in the media precisely because of how accurate and embarrassing the portrayal is.The single greatest service that teachers, as public servants, could deliver right now is committed recognition of, and action on, the dire need for greater mental health support in this country. We are better positioned than any other professionals to ensure that young people spend their days in a place that ensures their psychological safety and mental wellbeing.As a country we need to recognise that it is time to up our game and look at mental health through a preventative lens. We cannot afford to take it for granted that we are well. With mental health services under considerable pressure and waiting lists long, it stands to reason that doing all we can to avoid needing those services makes sense.Ireland’s investment in mental health is historically low. In 2020, 5.2 per cent of overall health funding was allocated to mental health in 2019 it had been 6.3 per cent. Despite Covid’s inevitable impact on mental health, other areas were deemed more acute and mental health funding was cut. As a nation we were in no position to make that reduction, given that we have always fallen well behind the World Health Organisation’s recommendation that 14 per cent of the overall health budget goes to mental health.An inidual’s mental health battle can feature in other sectors too. Section 12 of the Mental Health Act 2001 gives a member of the Garda the power to take a person into custody if the member “has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is suffering from a mental disorder and that because of the mental disorder there is a serious likelihood of the person causing immediate and serious harm to himself or herself or to other persons”.A recent report covering a 12-month period from July 2018 to June 2019, “Delivering Custody Services”, reveals that during that time more than 2,000 people were in custody under this legislation, and 3 per cent were under 18 years of age. While that 3 per cent may not represent a huge number of children, more than 2,700 young people were awaiting care at child and adolescent mental health services as 2021 drew to a close. By any standards that is a very high figure.Little wonder, then, that the families behind those statistics now see it as inevitable that they share their stories openly, including at school. How we all conduct ourselves in conversations on mental health will determine whether such courage pays off and results in iniduals feeling supported or not. Tolstoy captures the community aspect of our humanity particularly well with: “If you feel pain, you’re human. If you feel other people’s pain, you’re a human being”.As with the Covid pandemic, we must also be in this one together."},{"url":null,"title":"other options studying for a master s in europe","story":"For Andrew Cotter, who is studying a master’s degree in political science at Vrije University in Amsterdam, an equivalent degree would have cost him about €10,000 in IrelandPeople pursue master’s degrees for a variety of reasons, such as to progress further in a chosen career path, to hold an additional qualification in that area (which could lead to higher remuneration when joiningrejoining the workforce), to expand their knowledge or even to change career paths entirely. For any of these reasons and more, master’s degrees can be very worthy pursuits. According to an OECD report, in 2018 12 per cent of Irish people had achieved a master’s degree or equivalent, while the probability of an Irish person entering a master’s programme during their lifetime is an impressive 25 per cent, several points above the OECD average of 19 per cent.However, not all Irish people studying master’s degrees do so in Ireland, with many people opting to study abroad instead. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as the high cost of tuition in Ireland, the high cost of living, the variety of courses on offer and the desire to live in another country and experience another culture.In Ireland, master’s degrees for Irish and European UnionEEA students vary in price from between €4,500 and €12,000. Studying in the UK or United States can be incredibly expensive for Irish students who have not received funding to continue their studies. However, studying within the EU can be very cost effective, for a highly respected and regarded degree.For Andrew Cotter, who is studying a master’s degree in political science at Vrije University in Amsterdam, an equivalent degree would have cost him about €10,000 in Ireland, while in Amsterdam it costs roughly a quarter of that.Michael Bruun Nielsen opted to study an MA in ecology and conservation at Uppsala University in Sweden, where there are no tuition fees whatsoever for EUEEA students.ScandinaviaFi Carroll – a recent fashion design graduate of NCAD – is considering a master’s in fashion design with textiles. With very few options in Ireland, they had always hoped to study in the UK however, they are now considering studying in Scandinavia.“For me, the fees elsewhere in Europe are a massive draw. In Sweden it’s completely free to study there as an EU citizen, so naturally that’s a big draw compared to Ireland.”In Denmark, international students can receive a government grant if they have a part-time job, for their contribution to the Danish economy in addition to their wages. This is also a major pull factor for Carroll.The appeal of living abroad itself was a factor in pursuing a master’s in Uppsala, for Bruun Nielsen, but it was also an opportunity to move out from the family home, something he did not feel would otherwise be possible in Ireland.“I knew I wanted to move abroad, mainly because I knew I couldn’t move out in Ireland even if I got a job, so it was more about moving out than anything.”Cotter was similarly motivated, citing his main reason for doing a master’s abroad was “to just live abroad, or just move out in general, but moving out in Ireland wasn’t really an option”.Carroll similarly feels “in general the idea of experiencing studying and living in another country is exciting”, and that this will push them to study abroad when the time comes.While Bruun Nielsen was considering where to pursue a master’s, Covid-19 and the level of restrictions in each country were a major factor. There were a handful of similar courses elsewhere throughout Europe however, Sweden had the lowest level of restrictions. “I thought it would have been hard to actually integrate yourself in somewhere that was very restricted, like Ireland was and like a lot of other countries were, so Sweden, I could move here and I could sort of get involved in things, I could meet people.”Bruun Nielsen began his degree online from Sweden at the end of August, and by the beginning of October was attending lectures in person. Since then there has been one two-week period of restrictions, where nightclubs closed, other venues had capacity regulations and lectures were moved online in February. However, outside of these occasions restrictions have remained very mild.Restrictions in the Netherlands have been stricter for Cotter. With the rise of Omicron last November-December, all of his lectures were moved online, and Cotter opted to come home.AdventureFor Carroll, the limitations and monotony of lockdown in Ireland have also encouraged them even more to look abroad when choosing where to study. “Not being able to travel for quite a long time and working and studying from home has definitely made me crave a bit of adventure and the chance to experience something other than Dublin.”When tuition fees are so much lower abroad than they are in Ireland, other expenses such as accommodation and cost of living must be considered when choosing to study abroad.In Uppsala, Bruun Nielsen has found his accommodation to be much more affordable than any equivalent in Dublin. “The accommodation is way, way cheaper than Dublin. Sweden also has quite a lot of tenants’ rights, so you have to have a minimum standard of living to rent out somewhere, so the place you’re getting is gonna have to be at a minimum standard.”Otherwise, the cost of living in Sweden differs from Ireland in a lot of ways. Social infrastructure such as public transport and healthcare are heavily subsidised, while day-to-day expenses are quite high. “It’s mainly just social things and buying food that is the expensive part. Healthcare is really affordable, and there are loads of caps on how much you’re allowed to spend on medical services, so I guess in the long run, it actually all balances out.”Bruun Nielsen also found there to be a big difference between Irish people and Swedish people socially. “The biggest culture shock is definitely the people, and how you get to know people is a lot different, it’s less immediate – you’re gonna have to put in the groundwork first, but then once you get to know them, they’re great.”“I thought they’d be a lot less friendly than they are, they are still friendly.”Finding accommodation in Amsterdam proved difficult for Cotter. The university’s student accommodation was all booked out when he moved to the Netherlands last year, and he spent the first month of his course living in a hostel. He then returned to Ireland for a month, and it was only upon his return, when he told the university that if he could not find somewhere to live he did not know if he’d be able to continue with his course, that he was finally offered emergency student accommodation by the university.Cotter now lives in a studio apartment close to the city centre. “I think for what I have and the location, it’s a good price in that sense. I wouldn’t be getting anything like that in Ireland anyway.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"\u0026ldquoWindthrow is now the greatest threat to economic forestry in IrelandStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"all women firm with four day week friday off means we have weekends to ourselves","story":" Alex Duggan (from left), Laura Dignam, Brianna Morris, Sinead Deens, Nora Morris, Maggie Greene and Lesa Malone at the  Brady Management Global office in Ballycoolin, Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill Hot-water bottles for period pain, free slippers, a four-day week and free hugs are just some of the perks on offer at an all-women Irish company.Sisters Lesa Malone and Nora Morris lead a team of seven at their financial firm Brady Management Global Ltd and say they are inundated with requests from other women seeking to work in an office where messages of support are regularly left on colleagues desks.“It was never meant to be an all-women firm but it just happened that way,” said Lesa, who founded the Co Meath-based company with her sister in 2016.“Most of the staff were referred to us. Some are our daughters and daughters-in-law and others are friends or people they’ve worked with in the past. They just happen to be all women.”She added: “We have had men here on work placement in the past so we are by no means anti-men.” The company helps businesses with matters such as book-keeping and payroll and has clients in Ireland and the US, where it is seeking to expand. Due to Covid-19, staff were equipped to work from home but they all decided they wanted to return to the office.“We have hot-water bottles to ease any period pain. We have slippers for all the girls to keep cosy in winter and as we are aware of staff who are going through the menopause, we have fans at the ready to quell the hot flushes,” Lesa said.“The girls leave notes for each other all the time with messages of support. So if someone is at college one of the days, they’ll come back to find a note saying they hoped the classes went well and that they had a great day. That kind of thing.”Check-upsHaving seen their mother Bridget die at a young age from cancer, and having had their own health challenges, the sisters encourage staff to have regular check-ups. The company introduced a four-day working week in 2019 in order to ensure working mothers were not spending their weekends cleaning or food shopping.“It was something Lesa and I discussed pre-Covid because as working mothers, we found we were spending Saturday and Sunday cleaning the house or doing the laundry or the food shopping,” said Nora.“Having the Friday off means we can do all that and then have the weekends to ourselves. . . The girls are delighted. They do a few hours extra over the other four days and then have the longer weekend.”On International Women’s Day, Lesa and Nora insist that women need more flexibility in the workplace, especially if they have children, and their approach has made staff retention easy.“No one wants to leave,” said Nora. “Everyone tells us they are here to stay until they retire. And we are constantly asked by other women for a job.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"coalition to sanction plans hardening oversight of nursing homes","story":"Thousands died  in nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic. File photograph: GettyThe Government is set to approve plans to strengthen oversight of the nursing homes sector in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. While the steps being brought to Cabinet today by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly are not explicitly linked to Covid, it is understood that he will seek permission to draft legislation providing additional enforcement powers and tools for the chief inspector in the Health Information and Quality Authority. The additional powers envisaged will also include provisions for non-compliance notices and new powers in relation to unregistered providers. The Department of Health also plans to introduce new reporting structures to improve operational data supplied by nursing home operators to enable more detailed planning for the entire sector. It is thought that the move from Mr Donnelly is likely to be followed by further regulatory and legislative provisions relating to the sector, which saw thousands of deaths linked to the Covid-19 pandemic.BusConnects agendaSeparately, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan is to seek Cabinet approval for the business case for the Bus Connects programme, which clears the way for planning applications to be submitted. The step will also enable the National Transport Authority to start procurement for so-called “next generation ticketing”, such as payment of fares with mobile phones.Under the BusConnects programme, some 230km of bus corridors and 200km of cycle lines will be introduced. However, the plan has faced pushback at local level amid residents’ concern over the impact on some amenities and other issues. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath will also brief colleagues on plans for the Brexit Adjustment Reserve fund, from which Ireland is to receive €1 billion to mitigate the impacts of the UK exit from the European Union. Ministers will be asked for proposals to tackle the adverse impacts, in particular measures to support the fisheries and agri sectors, reskilling and checks at ports and airports. It runs to the end of 2023 and Ireland has already received €361 million in funding. Some €270 million has been allocated already, including €66 million for a scheme decommissioning parts of the whitefish fleet, for digital skills and the Rosslare Europort Border Control measures. Extra facilities have been built at the Co Wexford sea port, as well as at Dublin Airport and the capital’s port, because of checks and controls required as a consequence of the United Kingdom leaving the EU. After Cabinet, Mr Donnelly will launch an action plan for Women’s Health, coinciding with International Women’s Day, including implementation plans for free contraception services, specialist menopause clinics, specialist endometriosis services and regional fertility hubs. It will also cover Safe Access Zones legislation and the Human Reproduction Bill, dealing with the issue of surrogacy, but which is also a precursor for publicly funded in vitro fertilisation.

Photograph: ass via Getty ImagesVladimir Putin sparked menacing echoes of the Cuban missile crisis last weekend by putting his nuclear forces on high alert, triggering concern about a very dangerous escalation in the Ukraine conflict.The Russian president placed his nuclear arsenal on “special combat duty regime”, suggesting a rise in the alert level, in response to sanctions imposed over the invasion. Days before, he warned that interference would spark consequences “never before experienced in your history”.Putin’s order was vague, particularly since the terminology did not match anything in Russian nuclear doctrine. But it raised the spectre of Russia firing short-range nuclear missiles at Ukraine and using the threat of his vast nuclear arsenal to warn the US and western allies not to intervene.Heather Williams, a nuclear expert at King’s College London and visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, said it was “totally ambiguous” but in keeping with a leader who has a history of being a “nuclear bully”.“It is classic Putin, creating ambiguity and uncertainty,” Williams said. “Putin is so good at that because he knows that it keeps people on edge.”In 2015, the year after Russia annexed Crimea, he told a TV documentary he had been ready to put his nuclear forces on alert during the conflict. Three years later, Putin said Russia had developed an “invincible” nuclear cruise missile that could hit any target in the world. He also gave a presentation with animated videos showing missiles heading towards Florida where then president Donald Trump has his Mar-a-Lago resort.Williams added that Russia was also increasingly developing weapons that had dual capabilities – with the potential to carry nuclear or conventional warheads – which created yet more ambiguity.Belarus roleAdding to the threat, on the day that Putin gave the order to Sergei Shoigu, defence minister, and General Valery Gerasimov, head of Russia’s military, Belarus, a Russian ally that has facilitated its invasion of Ukraine, changed its constitution to remove a ban on nuclear weapons.Pavel Podvig, a nuclear expert at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, said the nuclear directive seemed more designed for political impact. He pointed out that Shoigu reported back to Putin the next day to say that nuclear command centre crews had been reinforced, suggesting the order was to make sure sufficient personnel were in place.“It appears that it wasn’t as dramatic as some suggested,” he said. “The primary purpose of the announcement was to send a message: ‘Don’t even try to attack us or play with us because . . . we’re prepared to strike back.’”Roger McDermott, a nuclear expert and visiting fellow at King’s College London, said the command posts were always fully manned, further suggesting that the order did not imply a change in the nuclear posture.“While Putin’s nuclear alert level announcement has been widely publicised in western countries as ‘signalling’ concerning nuclear deterrence, it was more likely crafted for domestic consumption,” he said.McDermott said the actual nuclear signalling occurred the previous week when Russia held its annual “Grom” nuclear exercise as a “warning to other powers to avoid interference in Russia’s operation against Ukraine”.The FT reported last month that General Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs, had told Congress he thought Russia would bring forward the exercise to February in a warning to the West.Pentagon responseUS military and intelligence has spent the past week scouring for signs that Russia was making changes in response to the order. The Pentagon said it had not detected any change in Russia’s strategic nuclear forces posture.Admiral Charles Richard, head of Strategic Command which manages the US nuclear arsenal, on Tuesday said he was “satisfied” with his nuclear posture and had not recommended changes in response to Putin’s move.But the Pentagon did postpone an intercontinental ballistic missile test to avoid it being “misconstrued” by Russia – only the fourth delay since 2001.Some experts welcomed the move as a prudent measure. But Rebeccah Heinrichs, a nuclear expert at the Hudson Institute, argued that Putin could interpret the postponement as US weakness. “No matter how much the president’s team will insist it isn’t so, it looks like Russia intimidated them.”Several days after Putin’s order, Russia announced that nuclear submarines had sailed for exercises in the Barents Sea and there were also reports of mobile missile launchers moving in Siberian forests.One western military official said Nato had watched several Russian nuclear-capable submarines head for sea, but he said that after bleeping out their position – to ensure that they would be detected – they returned to port.While many experts believe Putin was bluffing to gain leverage, the US and Nato are taking the threat seriously. The Pentagon declined to comment on a report that, since the start of the invasion, it had increased flights of E-6 aircraft – a critical part of the US nuclear command-and-control network.France has responded by deploying a second nuclear-powered submarine that carries nuclear missiles, according to one person familiar with the matter who confirmed a French newspaper report. The deployment of the submarine is the first time since 1997 that Paris has had two at sea simultaneously, according to the person familiar with the situation.“Does he escalate at this moment in time when he feels the world is against him? We must be prepared for that,” said a senior western defence official. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Full coverage of the Russian invasion of UkraineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists identify genetic factors behind severe covid symptoms","story":"A digital-generated image of different variants of Covid-19 cells against a gray background.  Photograph: Getty ImagesBritish scientists have identified some of the genetic factors that make certain people more likely to suffer severe Covid-19 symptoms than others,as part of a major study that could aid the development of new treatments for the disease.Researchers pinpointed 16 genes that predispose patients to critical illness as part of the world’s largest study into the genetics of the disease, which was led by scientists from the University of Edinburgh and Genomics England. They also confirmed seven other genes associated with severe Covid that had been identified by earlier research.The genes pinpointed by the research are linked to the immune system’s ability to recognise foreign pathogens, alongside the biological mechanisms involved in blood clotting and lung inflammation – some of the hallmarks of severe Covid. The disease has killed an estimated six million people since the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020.Dr Kenneth Baillie, a critical care consultant from the University of Edinburgh who led the study, said the results helped “explain why some people develop life-threatening Covid-19, while others get no symptoms at all”.Potential new treatments could help “get the mortality down to zero” among Covid-19 patients admitted to intensive care, he added. Genetic patterns The research identified genetic patterns by comparing whole genome samples from 7,491 Covid-19 patients admitted to intensive care units across the UK with the DNA of 1,630 people who experienced mild Covid-19 symptoms and a further 48,400 people who have never had Covid-19 and had their DNA analysed as part of the UK goverThe UK leads the world in genomic sequencing on account of substantial government investment over the past decade. Whole genome sequencing – a process which involves reading all three billion biochemical letters of an inidual’s genetic code– is a more labour-intensive version of the process used to analyse viral variants of Covid-19.Scientists said they hoped the genetic clues offered by the findings, published in the scientific journal Nature on Monday, could help medical experts to identify existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat Covid-19 or contribute to research for novel treatments.Existing drugs used to treat illnesses such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease already target some of the 16 genes identified by the study and could now be selected for clinical trials, the researchers said. Mortality riskEarlier results from the same study helped to identify arthritis drug baricitinib, which research published last week found cut the mortality risk of Covid-19 by 13 per cent, as a potential treatment for the virus.Sir Mark Caulfield, formerly chief scientist at Genomics England and a co-author of the study, said the findings would “offer a route” to new tests as well as treatments. “As Covid-19 evolves we need to focus on reducing the number of people getting seriously ill and being hospitalised,” he added.Dr Baillie suggested the research could help clinicians better understand severe illness caused by other viral infections in future. “We understand the mechanisms of Covid better than the other syndromes we treat in intensive care in normal times – sepsis, flu and other forms of critical illness,” he said. “Covid-19 is showing us the way to tackle those problems in the future.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Authors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"can west afford energy embargo","story":"The ultimate sanction against Russia for invading Ukraine is an embargo on its sales of oil and gas. Impounding the yachts of billionaire oligarchs is incidental to the true source of financing for Vladimir Putin’s war – energy exports.Last Friday, as rockets rained down on civilian areas, Shell stepped in to the market to buy a substantial quantity of Russian oil at a heavily discounted price. This was not in breach of the sanctions because they do not cover energy sales.Such was the obloquy heaped on Shell that it subsequently pledged to give any profits to a relief fund for Ukrainian refugees. The company said that, while it was appalled by the events in Ukraine, “we currently purchase it … to ensure that we continue the production of essential fuels and products that people and businesses rely on every day.” Herein lies the conundrum. People in the West are horrified by what is going on in Ukraine but how much disruption to their own lives are they prepared to put up with to demonstrate their concern?Shell was buying the oil to meet consumer demand in the absence of any other immediately available sources. It may be possible to find alternatives but it will take time, assuming other producers are ready to play ball. An embargo on Russian oil would have a massive knock-on impact on the global economy, not just Russia’s, as was apparent from the fall in global stock markets.To a great extent a de facto embargo is already in place since traders are largely shunning Russian crude. Shell bought at a heavily discounted price because the producers are struggling to offload it. As storage sites fill up, Russia will be forced to cut production with potentially calamitous consequences for its industry.On the markets, the price of a barrel is now at a 10-year high, which means bonanza revenues for Russia if it could sell the oil at spot prices. An embargo would make any such purchases unlawful and seriously harm Putin even if he were able to sell some to China. But there can be no pretence that it will not damage Western economies, though America is much less exposed than Europe, where there is little appetite for an embargo as was clear at the No 10 summit yesterday.The added danger is that such a move reinforces Putin’s domestic narrative that the West has ganged up on Russia. Death by a thousand cuts might be a better option.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow threatens to cut off West\u0026#39s gas supplies through Nord Stream 1International Women\u0026#39s Day 2022: How it began and why the fight for women\u0026#39s rights is still necessaryRussian shelling is prevent civilians from leaving cities, says Ukraine\u0026#39s presidentRussia sets out demands to end Ukraine war – but Kyiv is likely to find them unpalatableRoot out the dodgy police officers by making them re-interview for jobs, review recommendsBillions of PPE gloves bought by UK may have been made by firms using forced labourMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"queen ditches walking stick hosts justin trudeau","story":"The Queen has held her first in-person engagement since catching Covid, showing her support for the people of Ukraine as she meets with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister .The Queen, who dispensed with her walking stick, was photographed with Mr Trudeau with a large arrangement of striking blue and yellow flowers in between them.The colours of the Ukrainian flag were seen prominently at the centre of the pictures, taken at an unusual angle in the Oak Room at Windsor to ensure they can be seen by the watching world.Neither the Queen, who is 95, nor the prime minister wore a mask during the audience, in common with other recent engagements for Her Majesty.Mr Trudeau is in Britain for talks on the war in Ukraine with Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, and Mark Rutte, his Dutch counterpart .The Queen has made a “generous” private donation to help Ukrainian refugees fleeing war, while members of her family have spoken directly about their support.Prince Charles condemned the “brutal” actions of Russian forces, saying he had been “deeply moved” by the “extraordinary bravery, generosity and fortitude of the Ukrainian community in the face of such truly terrible aggression”.On Monday, the Queen, who is also the Queen of Canada, was pictured in a patterned dress, standing and smiling warmly at Mr Trudeau as he held her right hand in both of his.Mr Trudeau was also seen laughing as the Queen gestured towards herself during the meeting in the Oak Room sitting room.Asked about his audience with the Queen, Mr Trudeau said: “I was able to talk about the situations we are facing and draw on her long experience from having seen so much over these past decades.”He also congratulated her on reaching the milestone of her Platinum Jubilee.The pair have enjoyed a warm relationship, and in 2015 the Queen made Commonwealth leaders laugh during a visit to Malta by publicly telling the prime minister: “Thanks for making me feel so old.”The head of state was not pictured with the walking stick she has been using of late.Asked about the Queen\u0027s health at a press conference, Mr Trudeau said: “I have had the privilege of knowing Her Majesty for about 45 years now, and I can tell you that in my meeting with her this morning, she was as insightful and perspicacious as ever. We had a really useful conversation about global events, as we always do.”Canada, a Commonwealth realm, has been the Queen\u0027s most frequent overseas destination.She has visited more than 20 times, including a trip as a princess, but a number of years ago she called time on her official overseas visits.As a young child in the 1970s, Mr Trudeau met the Queen several times through his father, Pierre Trudeau, who was one of Canada’s longest-serving prime ministers.The Queen tested positive for Covid on February 20 and has spent the last two weeks carrying out only light duties including a handful of virtual audiences.Last Tuesday, the Prince of Wales said his mother was “a lot better now”, and the head of state was pictured holding her first virtual audiences since her coronavirus diagnosis.The Queen has two high-profile events coming up – the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on March 14, and then the Duke of Edinburgh’s memorial service, also at the Abbey, on March 29.The nation’s longest reigning monarch, who reached her Platinum Jubilee milestone last month, recently spent more than three months resting, on doctors’ orders.Last autumn she pulled out of attending the Cop26 climate change summit, the Festival of Remembrance and then the Remembrance Sunday Cenotaph service due to a sprained back.She also missed the Church of England’s General Synod.The Queen now regularly uses a walking stick and has been pictured looking frailer recently.She remarked during a Windsor Castle audience last month: “Well, as you can see, I can’t move.”Mr Trudeau is joining Mr Johnson as part of intense diplomatic efforts with foreign leaders to build a united front against Vladimir Putin.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow threatens to cut off West\u0026#39s gas supplies through Nord Stream 1International Women\u0026#39s Day 2022: How it began and why the fight for women\u0026#39s rights is still necessaryRussian shelling is prevent civilians from leaving cities, says Ukraine\u0026#39s presidentRussia sets out demands to end Ukraine war – but Kyiv is likely to find them unpalatableRoot out the dodgy police officers by making them re-interview for jobs, review recommendsBillions of PPE gloves bought by UK may have been made by firms using forced labourMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russias z could become next swastika","story":"Three strips of tape forming the letter “Z” – that’s all it was. A DIY symbol on the shirt of 20-year-old Ivan Kuliak, a Russian gymnast performing on the parallel bars at a competition in Doha. But, as always in times of war, symbols matter. And no matter the place or the context, these days “Z” is no longer just a letter of the alphabet.Instead, it has become an icon of support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, daubed on Russian roads and walls, on bus shelters and cars, stitched into jacket lapels or formed by human chains – a public sign of devotion to Vladimir Putin and his campaign. You can even buy T-shirts emblazoned with it from the website of the state-controlled broadcaster, Russia Today, for 1,190 roubles – worth almost £12 a month ago a little over £6 today.Displayed on the chest of a muscle-bound Russian athlete with cropped blond hair, however, darker associations form for Z: images of German competitors, Aryan supermen as they were proclaimed, standing next to swastikas in the 1930s, swearing loyalty to the Führer. No wonder Ukraine’s Illia Kovtun, who won the parallel bars competition, looks aghast as he is forced to pose next to Kuliak, who came third.Of course, perhaps Kuliak was forced to wear the “Z”. Or perhaps he merely wanted to show solidarity with Russian conscripts, duped and dying in Ukraine. Having reportedly undergone military training himself last year, he will know that many of them are his young age, that they retain boyish features just as he does, and that they were certainly not prepared for this.But perhaps not.For though it is only a little more than a week since Russian armoured columns rolled south from Belarus into Ukraine, many bearing three stripes of tape like Kuliak’s, “Z” has undergone a transformation. Then, according to Ukrainian soldiers, it simply marked out units from Russia’s Eastern Military District, based half a world away in Khabarovsk, just north of the border with China, inland from the Pacific Coast.Now, however, Z has been appropriated and subverted, propelled from the practical insignia of a military marshalling yard to the emblem of a propaganda war unleashed by Moscow on the home front. It has come, not coincidentally, as many of the Eastern Military District’s armoured vehicles have got bogged down: even as they flounder in Ukraine, so the Z campaign, channelling support, defiance and chilling aggression, has taken wing in Russia.Its spread from the battlefield to the civilian front has been astonishing. As evidence of the former, writer Kamil Galeev, an Russian opposition activist and formerly a Fellow on Human Rights and Conflict Resolution at the Woodrow Wilson research centre in Washington DC, has posted pictures of a Z that Russian soldiers have formed from the insignia they claim are ripped from uniforms of killed Ukrainian soldiers. Other pictures, meanwhile, show children back home in a Russian hospice, presumably terminally ill, led out to form a human “Z” snaking through the winter snow. In orchestrated videos circulating on social media, flag-waving Russians stand in serried ranks wearing the Z emblem.“‘Z’ doesn’t exist in the Cyrillic alphabet,” notes Sir Richard Evans, historian of modern Europe at Cambridge University, “but it’s rapidly become widely used by Putin’s supporters.” They include Maria Butina, a politician who was convicted in America for “acting as an unregistered foreign agent after she was discovered involving herself in the National Rifle Association and attempting to influence Donald Trump”. For “unregistered foreign agent”, read spy.In St Petersburg, “Z” is displayed in huge neon signs on major buildings. Nor is it limited to Russia. In Belgrade, thousands of pro-Russian sympathisers marched over the weekend to back the invasions, many with placards bearing the three simple lines of the “Z”.Such mutual support has been seen before, in the Balkan wars of the mid-90s. Then, Russian peacekeepers would signal to Serb troops – later convicted of genocide – with a three-fingered salute. The salute, representing the Trinity, was a gesture of fellow feeling from Russian Orthodox soldiers to fellow Christians of the Serb Orthodox Church.To many Bosnian Muslims, however, the three-fingered salute came to represent terror and death, a taunt by their ultra-nationalist Serb captors, known as Chetniks, which they were made to echo, and which often presaged torture or execution.Naturally, though, it is the swastika which, of all symbols, has come most indelibly to represent terror, extremism and murder. It too had innocent origins, perhaps as long as 7,000 years before it was appropriated by the Nazis, deriving from the Sanskrit word “svastika”, meaning “good fortune” or “well-being”. The sign itself was sacred in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism for millennia. A century ago, Rudyard Kipling happily daubed the covers of his books with the swastika. For the first years of its existence, the US 45th Infantry Division wore a badge which celebrated its many Native American soldiers with an ancient American Indian symbol of good luck – an orange swastika.Far more significant than brand impact, however, is what the possible evolution of Z could signal for Russia. For Galeev, the conclusions are clear. The country already has a police state that offers control and repression, and a political system focused solely on the leader. With “Z”, it may have a symbol to vaunt and mythologise its military forces and behind which its people can unite, collapsing the space between a civilian and military state.In his view, “Z” is this the third key strut of an ideology the world had hoped was behind it. “Russia,” he writes, “is now fascist.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow threatens to cut off West\u0026#39s gas supplies through Nord Stream 1International Women\u0026#39s Day 2022: How it began and why the fight for women\u0026#39s rights is still necessaryRussian shelling is prevent civilians from leaving cities, says Ukraine\u0026#39s presidentRussia sets out demands to end Ukraine war – but Kyiv is likely to find them unpalatableRoot out the dodgy police officers by making them re-interview for jobs, review recommendsBillions of PPE gloves bought by UK may have been made by firms using forced labourMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"west has finally awoken putin amnesia","story":"Putin has blundered. He hoped the world would respond like it did in 2014 when he annexed Crimea, with outrage followed by business as usual. He assumed we would condemn and then largely forget, as we did when he invaded Georgia in 2008. And he thought we would ask “Where’s Kyiv?” like some asked “Where’s Grozny?” two decades ago.Instead the world is appalled, united and determined. This time there’s no way back. Whereas Putin remained part of the international community after all those earlier horrors, in the popular imagination he is the closest this century has to a Hitler. We have woken up to the terrible truth that he seeks to recreate the Soviet Union, with Ukraine as merely the first piece in a large, blood-soaked jigsaw.After 1990, it suited us to believe in the end of history. In Europe, at least, democracy and freedom had triumphed, and we kidded ourselves it would always be like that. We spent 30 years with the luxury of regarding war in Europe as something confined largely to history books, but now unthinkable. The rules-based order, we assumed, would always prosper. We were free to fight our own silly battles instead, tearing down statues and obsessing about whether Churchill was a racist.So we ignored the pleas from Ukraine to take the Russian threat seriously. When Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine’s foreign minister from 2014 to 2019, wrote in the British press that “Europe has sleepwalked into an increasingly precarious and less safe place”, it felt safe to ignore him. “Reversing the breakup of the Soviet Union and restoring the Russian empire have now become an obsession for the Kremlin”, Klimkin beseeched. Yeah right, we yawned. How about we cancel Fawlty Towers?Well, now the scales have fallen from our eyes. It happened almost literally overnight, less than two weeks ago. We see Ukrainians being slaughtered in the biggest outrage on European soil since 1945. We see genocide, with schools and hospitals being targeted, as well as fleeing civilians, and thousands being killed. And we realise that while Ukraine may be on the geographical edge of Europe, it is in every other respect in the heart of the continent, with European cities, culture, hopes and aspirations. Ukrainians are educated, democratic, peace-loving Europeans every bit as much as we are in Britain, France or Germany. When Ukraine is attacked, we are all attacked.But there’s more. Putin’s response to predictable setbacks in the first two weeks of war and the loss, according to Ukraine, of 11,000 troops (that’s a thousand a day), is to allude to nuclear war like some preposterous James Bond villain. Yet if that was meant to intimidate, it has had the opposite effect, with more countries seeking to join Nato. We see Putin cracking down on the growing internal opposition, and mandating that anyone who criticises his warped version of events will be sent to prison for 15 years, and we realise he’s a lethal lunatic. No wonder only four countries voted with Russia at the UN last week – Syria, Eritrea, Belarus and North Korea.And then we see President Zelensky, who has united his country behind him and personifies the refusal to be subjugated. It is little wonder that the world views Ukraine versus Russia, and Zelensky versus Putin, as a simple choice between good and evil. It’s a narrative that Putin will now never overturn. No more World Cups to host, no more banquets at Buckingham Palace, no more summits with naïve Merkels or Macrons to impress across a 20-feet-long table. He’s blown it.Putin\u0027s Russia tells lies with breathtaking ease. It respects only strength and exploits weakness. It threatens global peace. Ukraine has said all this for years, and begged the rest of us to notice. Finally we are. There is no way back for Putin this time.And yet, just as the West is giving Ukraine weapons and sanctioning Russia like never before, we have to do more. Otherwise, for Ukraine, it could all be too late.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow threatens to cut off West\u0026#39s gas supplies through Nord Stream 1International Women\u0026#39s Day 2022: How it began and why the fight for women\u0026#39s rights is still necessaryRussian shelling is prevent civilians from leaving cities, says Ukraine\u0026#39s presidentRussia sets out demands to end Ukraine war – but Kyiv is likely to find them unpalatableRoot out the dodgy police officers by making them re-interview for jobs, review recommendsBillions of PPE gloves bought by UK may have been made by firms using forced labourMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nursing heroes demand pay rise","story":"Nursing heroes demand pay rise of more than % as NHS staff face £ real-terms cutThe Royal College of Nursing today unveils its demand for a pay rise % above the rate of inflation - and the RPI measure hit .% at the time the demand was made.NHS staff march through central London during a protest Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  Mar |commentsNurses could lose around £ a year in real-terms pay after a below inflation pay rise proposed by the Government. NHS workers have been offered a paltry % pay rise by the Tories which is likely to be less than half the rate of inflation. Analysis from the Royal College of Nursing shows a nurse with seven years experience in England is set to lose out by around £ a year once National Insurance and pension changes take effect. The % pay proposal to the NHS Pay Review Body comes after a decade of pay stagnation and below inflation settlements. RCN General Secretary Pat Cullen said: “If the Government does not listen it will be to the detriment of patients when more and more nursing staff decide to leave the profession. “With three months until they are expected to make an announcement, they must listen to people who work in our health and care services.  “When a nurse or health care support worker feels no alternative but to leave, it becomes ever more challenging to provide highly effective care and treatment. They deserve salaries fitting of a safety critical profession. “By summer, ministers must come back with a pay award that turns the tide on the years of unfilled nursing jobs and experienced professionals struggling to make ends meet.” The RCN is calling for a pay award of % above the level of inflation. At the time it made its case, the RPI measure of inflation was running at .%. Its submission to the NHS Pay Review Body demonstrated that from April nursing staff will pay more National Insurance and many will see their pensions contributions increase too. It estimates that a nurse earning £, will be £ worse off this financial year compared to the   when they start paying more National Insurance. Government changes to the NHS pension system will sees these iniduals paying £ a year more into their pension scheme.  The combined impact of bigger pension contributions, and increased National Insurance, takes a further £ away from their net pay compared to last year. The NHS Pay Review Body will hear from interested parties before reporting to ministers in May. The Government will then decide whether to implement its recommendations. The RCN submission highlights recent data from the nursing regulator the Nursing and Midwery Council, showing an % increase in nurses in  compared to . The UK Government indicated in February that its NHS pay funding settlement was assuming a pay award of % to %. The amount set aside for NHS pay in Westminster determines the initial funding available in all parts of the UK, despite devolution of health policy. The NHS Pay Review Bodyprocess runs for England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Direct pay negotiations in Scotland are imminent. It comes as the Government claimed it was on track to meet a pledge to increase total nursing numbers in England by , by . The Department of Health and Social care said overall total nurse numbers now stand at , as of December , compared to , in September .Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “It’s fantastic to see the progress we have made towards our manesto commitment of delivering , more nurses by .“There are now over , more nurses providing exceptional care and treatment for patients across the country every day.” Figures from NHS England show there were , nurse vacancies in December, , more than a year earlier. The Government ordered its MPs to vote down a legal amendment to the Health and Care Bill that would require the NHS to commission independent analysis of staffing numbers needed to care for our aging population. Pat Cullen added: “The number of unfilled nurse jobs has risen in the last year, not fallen. “This workforce crisis with tens of thousands of vacant posts is hitting patient care and adds to waiting lists and treatment delays. “Without transparent publication of workforce data, nursing staff will question these claims. “The Government has not been transparent about how it calculates the numbers genuinely needed for safe and effective “This is a political target in the absence of a proper health and care workforce strategy. “Experienced nursing staff who stayed in the profession during the pandemic are now leaving in greater numbers. “One of the simplest ways to keep more staff is a fair pay rise that recognises their professional skill.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WestminsterNational Insurance Company Ltd.Royal College of NursingNHSNursing and Midwery CouncilBoris JohnsonPat CullenPensionsHealth reformsPoliticsInflation\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A spokesperson for Quintessentially - when Ben Elliot is a director - told the Mirror the firm’s Russian arm has had its franchise licence withdrawn, and is no longer paying fees to the UK headquarters.The spokesperson said: “It is one of several franchise operations - it’s not operated as a subsidiary. Within the last few days it has had its licence withdrawn, which means they can no longer trade or brand in any way as Quintessentially in Russia.” As the UK government promised sanctions against “hundreds” more wealthy Russians in a week’s time, the spokesperson added: “Effectively, Quintessentially are out of Russia.” Asked for the reason for pulling out, he admitted it was likely a mixture of “reputational, moral, business”. He said the Russian arm had  staff, saying: ”Theof time it took to make the decision reflects the fact they were mindful of  people’s livelihoods and they needed to be told.”  Quintessentially specialises in providing experiences and services to wealthy clients.Last week it deleted a page on its website which boasted it “has nearly  yearsapos experience providing luxury lestyle management services to Russiaaposs elite”.Ben Elliot, the co-chairman of the Conservative Party who helps source donations from billionaires, co-founded the firm and is a director.Labour have long been demanding the Tories sack Mr Elliot over his business activities, accusing him of “blurring the lines between private business and political office.”Labour MP Chris Bryant today demanded an investigation into Mr Elliot. Speaking in the Commons, he claimed the firm “has been providing restaurant recommendations in Crimea” - despite the fact it is illegal for UK firms to provide “services relating to tourism in Crimea”. The allegation was first made in The Times, which said Quintessentially recommended a restaurant in Yalta in a web post.  The spokesperson for Quintessentially insisted: “Categorically they are not giving our recommendations for restaurants in Crimea…. I’m told by the company that that is categorically not the case.” But Mr Bryant told the Commons: “Following the annexation of Crimea, we made it a criminal offence to support tourism activities in Crimea. “But Quintessentially, which is run by Ben Elliot, has been providing restaurant recommendations in Crimea to Russian oligarchs. “Surely he should be investigated, and everybody should be distancing themselves from him now.” Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper responded: “The information he has just provided is actually deeply disturbing.  “There is a huge responsibility on all of us and particularly the government to make sure there is no conflict of interest in terms of the source of any political donations or any role in the party and make sure there is a proper distancing from the appalling activities of corrupt Russian elites.” The Quintessentially spokesperson claimed the decision was made by the board rather than Mr Elliot personally, and was taken “within the last week”. Last year the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists warned Mr Elliot “to be cautious about the possibility of engaging in consultant lobbying activityby not making a clear enough distinction between his role as a director of Quintessentially and his other activities connected to government.” Labour called for him to be sacked, but he is still listed as a co-chairman of the Conservatives on the party’s website.The Conservative Party declined to comment, referring queries to the Quintessentially spokesman instead.It came after Foreign Secretary Liz Truss declared Britain will be able to sanction “hundreds of iniduals” next Tuesdayemergency legislation is rushed through Parliament in a week.The Economic Crime Bill moves to the Lords this week and could be swtly deployedit cleared all its Westminster stages, she told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee. It would allow the Government to target figures already sanctioned by the US and EU. Ms Truss told MPs: If Parliament passes the legislation by Monday March  we will be able to sanction the hundreds of iniduals by next Tuesday, March .” She blamed amendments by opposition peers to previous laws for hampering attempts by ministers and officials to be speedier and more wide-ranging with sanctions under the current system.

The revelation comes as the Home Office announced  Ukrainians have been granted a visa to join UK family out of , applications started - and .million refugees.It is likely to lead to fresh anger after Priti Patel was bombarded with criticism over families who have ended up in Calais. Hundreds of terried Ukrainians have started to arrive in the French port - but they have to submit a visa applicationthey have family in the UK. Currently this involves an in-person trip to Paris - currently the only UK visa centre in France - or Brussels to give fingerprints and other information. Refugees arriving at one centre today were met with the message: NO VISAS DELIVERED IN CALAIS. The Home Secretary sparked chaos today by announcing Ukrainians will also be able to get visas near Calais - but not yet. The Home Secretary told MPs we have set up a bespoke visa application centre en route to the port. But minutes later she claimed she never said that - and in fact the Home Office was still “setting up” the centre.Officials later said even when it opens, it wonapost be for all applicants in France. A Government spokesperson said it will be by referral from Border Force only to support Ukrainians. The primary Visa Application Centre in France will remain in Paris.” Until it does open, it is understood there are  appointments available at the UKaposs Paris Visa Application Centre this week, and  are protected for Ukrainians. Walk-in appointments are also available at the Visa Application Centre in Brussels but only Wednesday to Friday.Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the Commons: “The Home Office website is still telling people to go to Paris. Journalists who are in Calais and looking for any centre that there might be are still unable to find anything. All they can find is a few Home Office staff in a building with a crisp machine but no visas. One family there this afternoon who have been there for five days have been told they cannot get an appointment in Paris until March . “What on earth is going on ” Ms Patel denied families had been unable to get appointments for a week. Home Office sources insisted there was capacity at centres across Europe. Tonight the Home Office confirmed  visas had been issued so far - updating a figure of  by am yesterday, which the Home Office issued but Ms Patel branded “absolutely inaccurate”. Overall, , Ukraine Family Scheme applications had been started. Of these , have been submitted, , have attended a Visa Application Centre, and  applications have been confirmed. It came as a desperate builder spoke of his devastation after rescuing his we and children from Ukraine but being banned from getting them into the UK.Vitalie Turetska has been living and working in north London for the past three years.When Russia started bombing his home country he jumped in his car and drove to the Ukraine Romania border to get we and Helena and sons Danya, six and two-year-old Mapk. They are just some of the . million refugees who have already fled the terror in their home country. But now they are stranded in Calais after British authorities refused to let them cross the Channel. Vitalie said he was told he was allowed tobut he would have to leave his we and kids behind in France because, in his words, they don’t have the correct paperwork.A full family visa scheme for Ukrainians opened on Friday allowing applications from immediate family extended family and immediate family members of extended family.Immediate family are a spouse or civil partner, unmarried partner in a cohabiting relationship for two or more years, a child under , a parenttheir child in the UK is under , or a fiancee or proposed civil partner.

Matthew, and Christine Mullan say the project has allowed them to put their stamp on the place. Christine, , designed and project managed the renovation and ensured statutory requirements were kept to. An architect aposwho has the ideas and visionapos, she took itfrom start to finish. Matthew, , is an engineer and helped come up with solutions for his weaposs idea. Heaposs aposhands onapos and comes up with aposclever solutionsapos.The pair share interiors inspiration on Instagram through their page @architect_v_engineer.Christine told BelfastLive : We bought a s detached home. Although a very solid property, it had never been updated so we undertook a full renovation, taking it back to the bare bones.A three month contractor renovation build allowed us to move in December  and we then have undertaken the aesthetic as an ongoing project, doing this work ourselves.  We wanted a family home that was inidually designed to our needs - something we could have a bit of fun with and put our own stamp on. It’s all about family for us. We redesigned the layout on the ground floor and knocked walls down to create a large open plan living space. We took the house back to the bare structure, replumbed, rewired, replaced all the windows and updated it throughout.  We also converted some outside stores into the house to create a secret playroom for the kids. The -year-old explained what the hardest parts of renovating a property can be.She said:Budget, timescales and the unknown of an existing property.Some of our ideas finishes have been dferent to the norm and sometimes it hard to get tradespeople on board with the vision - it’s not always the easy option.  And for the best bits, the architect added: The best part was seeing our design come to le. Our children have been involved throughoutand seeing them be proud of what we have created makes it all worth it. With work still undergoing, the couple are pleased with the finished rooms and have many more transformation ideas.  For others currently renovating their home, Christine said: You will get there in the end. Sometimes it all becomes a bit much but when you get there, it is all worth it. Go with your gut and ideas, and don’t be put off by other peopleaposs opinions. We were relativity lucky, we didn’t have too many issues with the renovation in terms of building work.  However some of our ideas need a bit of trial and error to perfect. We are in the process of making our own worktops for our utility room and are now on the second attempt. Christine added where she gains interiors ideas from. Our inspiration came from experience in design and lot of Pinterest Houzz mood boards. We created our Instagram page architect_v_engineer for us - to track our progress but I didn’t appreciate the supportive community there was.  Itaposs absolutely now a place for inspiration and support, she said. She also has some money saving tips: Shop around! If you find something you like use the internet and seeyou can find it somewhere  at a better price. We saved over £sqm on the same tiles by doing some research. Also don’t feel like you have to do everything in one go.Make a list of what needs done and what you would like. Building work structure are all necessary but all the decoration can be done over time. We don’t do too much interior shopping, instead we tend to design and make a lot of pieces ourselves so they are unique and personal to us.

Footage shot by -year-old fiance Wayne Coldicutt shows her rush downstairs in pure terror before quickly calling her mum to yell weaposre getting attacked.On the TV, which lit the living room bright red, a BBC and Government-branded announcement headlined emergency broadcast tells them to be prepared to shelter for  days after the strike. The unnervingly monotone voice warns the fallout will cause radiation sickness, followed by death and advises them to build an inner refuge away from windows and doors. She reads the messages to mum Ann Redhead, , and emphasises this isnapost a joke - but then Ann turns on her TV and reveals the BBC arenapost showing an emergency broadcast at all.The clip has attracted criticism, with some branding it tone-deaf due to the current war in Ukraine, but Wayne insists the conflict wasnapost in his mind when he saw the broadcast video on YouTube.Warehouse operative Wayne says he noticed a mock video titled UK Emergency Alert - Nuclear Attack Warning on YouTube and hatched the plan to win their ongoing prank war.The smug dad says heaposs proud he managed not to laugh and found it hilarious - but heaposs relieved Becca immediately saw the funny side too. She says she genuinely thought the Russians were coming and they were going to die, and feels like sheaposs now experienced the start of World War Three first-hand. Becca, from Kirkdale, Merseyside, said: Heaposs lucky to still be alive, trust me. He nearly gave me a heart attack. I thought the Russians were coming. I can hand-on-heart say I feel like Iaposve lived through the beginning of a world war. Thataposs how it felt. It felt real. When I was running down stairs with Louie, I was in slow motion. I thought we were going to die. I thought aposIaposve got to phone my mumapos. She only lives over the road but I was scared to run over. Sheaposs quite a dramatic person, like you can see I am, but she was quite calm on the phone. I told her it wasnapost a joke because Wayne was so convincing. Usually he laughs but he looked scared. When she told me there was nothing on the BBC and I turned to see Wayne laughing. Now I donapost trust him. When I smiled at the end it was out of relief that we werenapost getting attacked. I probably wonapost believe itit happens for real now. Iaposll be the calmest person in Liverpool because Iaposve already done it now. Been there, done that. Iaposve watched it over and over because I keep laughing at myself. I say Iaposm not that dramatic, but Iaposm pathetically dramatic. Lots of people have said thataposs how theyaposd react too though. Iaposll try and get him back with a prank but I donapost think anything can top him creating World War Three. Becca even sent a photo of the TV screen to her brother, who was at the Goodison Park footage stadium watching Everton vs Manchester City and he believed it too. She says he was apostwo minutes awayapos from telling fans and causing mass panic. However, Wayne says the prank went perfectly and heaposs glad so many people found it as funny as he has, despite the criticism. The video, posted by Beccaaposs brother Alan Redhead, has been liked and retweeted more than , times, with users split on their opinion of whether it was funny or not. One said: There would be a nuclear fallout in my houseI done that. Another added: Love the priorities, ring mum first and forget about the sandbags and grub. One more commented: Ahahaha Iaposm crying laughing here lad. However some users thought the prank was insensitive and not funny at all. A user said: Look, I do see the humour in this. If you did this any other time, it would be hilarious.. but doing something like this right now is just really tone-deaf. Thereaposs people in Ukraine, for whom these messages on their TV are real. Spare them a thought. Another added: This is really unfunny, with what is happening being used as a punchline to an unfunny gag. Have a meeting with yourself.

Terry Stone, , is not shy about his tough upbringing after being born in Brixton and spending his early years in dferent parts of London including Putney, Kingston and Camberley.Now an actor, businessman and millionaire, he grew up on council estates and says his teenage years saw him gain the resilience that helped him get to where he is now, reports MyLondon. Terry left school with no qualications and was given his first taste of the real world in his three years at McDonaldaposs.  Terry Stone is now an Advocate  Senior Executive for FilmCoin, the worldaposs first film creation  TV production cryptocurrency.He praised the lessons that McDonaldaposs taught him to get to the position he is in and said: “I left school with no qualications and then went straight to working at McDonaldaposs. I was part time then went full time and it gave me an amazing grounding. It humbled me and gave me a work ethic. “Of course I didn’t love my job there. I was -years-old and we were cleaning toilets and bins - picking up litter outside with a pole. It was a degrading job but it taught me to muck in and work as a team. McDonaldaposs was like a training camp and showed me how business works. I wouldn’t recommend everyone do it but for me I was given discipline and it set me up for le. Kids nowadays would deny working at McDonaldaposs but itaposs humbling, I didnapost enjoy it but I can’t speak more highly of what I learnt there.” Following his time at McDonalds he tried to become a Marine and join the Royal Navy. Unfortunately, his fear of heights restricted progress in the field and he went back to claiming benefits. Terry then did odd jobs and at one point worked in an electronics shop, and in his first month he made more than his manager for selling so many products. Unfortunately, after a good start, the recession then hit and Terry was once again thrown back into poverty. Earning £ a week through benefits he found his calling at an unusual place - a rave. He said: “The rave scene exploded and all my friends were going. I pushed back but after around  requests to go with my mates I gave in - raves then changed my le. Everyone was friendly and chatty . I left a rave, saw a flyer guy and asked himhe got paid. I then became a flyer guy myself. They gave us a rave and we can go out and give flyers out. Got all my mates in and got a sign bonus for everyone that attended from my tickets. I went from nothing to £  pw doing flyers.  “Over the years this changed from selling at one event to selling for loads of events. I called every promoter and asked to sell their tickets and was soon selling thousands a week. Terry’s career in the music and events industry enabled him to set up two event companies which he then sold for millions of pounds. It started from flyering posters and by keeping his head down and working hard this snowballed into a company worth millions. He put the success down to hard work and doing something that he really loved. He said that it didn’t happen overnight and every step which went from him flyering to having his own business took months and years of hard graft. Terry wants to change the way that the education system speaks about kidsapos futures and after becoming successful looks with distaste at an old memory from his school days. He said: “When I was in school I saw the careers officer and told them that I wouldn’t mind certain things. I said I wanted to be a boxing promoter and do something I enjoy.  “Later that week the career officer read out some of the silly ideas that they had been presented with by the children. The career officer read out my plan as one of the silly ones. “It made me feel worthless and like I wasn’t going to make it. Children and teenagers should be told they can be anything. University isn’t always the way and unless you want to be a doctor or scientist you don’t have to go. Not enough young people are being told they can achieve stuffthey put their mind to it.” Terry outlined a few quotes that inspired him. He said the phrase find something you love and you’ll never do a dayaposs work resonated strongly with him and another quote young people should know is, “ you believe you can do it you can. If you believe you can’t do it you’re right”. It was these quotes that Terry kept in mind when he sold his events business and was at a loss with what he wanted to do.  He had always been interested in acting and when he told friends or associates his plans to be an actor and producer they laughed. The laugh was on them and he explained how he took the step into acting.He said: “My first ever acting job was on EastEnders playing the role of Mick alongside Shane Ritchie for only two episodes, but it was a lot of fun. Two episodes of EastEnders, theatre, then I produced films.“I just put my mind to it and approached people with my ideas. I was lucky to get the EastEnders role but then a friend told me that he wanted me to star in his film. That kickstarted things.” Terry has starred in and helped produce a total of more than  films. After his friend offered him an acting role things took off. He said that it was self belief, despite what other people thought, that allowed him to make inroads in the media sector. Terry has gone from a council estate to being worth millions of pounds. His main advice is self belief and to strive after what you enjoy. He finished by saying: “You can do whatever you want to do but you have got to make sacrices for it.

The team - known as the Lost Adventurers - have shared creepy footage showing the inside of the abandoned Bobsleigh Inn hotel in Bovingdon.The owners of the th century building transformed it into a hotel and renamed it The Bobsleigh Inn after their son won a gold medal in the event in the  winter Olympics. Chilling images show furniture rotting away and the hotelaposs rooms falling into disrepair after years of neglect. The swimming pool can be seen emptied of water apart from a puddle of stagnant brown liquid in the deep end.  Closer to the camera, leaves are seen scattered over the poolside tiles after  in the glass roof caved in. Another image shows an explorer at the entrance of a ransacked off, with documents and smashed computers strewn on the floor. In the basement, a metal shelving unit has become red with rust as it lies among other discarded objects.  The Lost adventurers say that the hotel was originally a th-century manor house until in the late th century when it became a country club. They added: Parts of the building were extended over time and eventually, in , it was renamed Bobsleigh Inn. It was named after the owneraposs son, who had won a gold medal in the bobsleigh during the  winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria.  While the hotel was a country club during the Second World War, many celebrities stayed there while entertaining troops at the nearby airbase, including Bob Hope, James Stewart and Glenn Miller. The most interesting find was the rotunda building that was full of hundreds of pieces of furniture. It was all stacked up to the ceiling and still in amazing condition.  There must be thousands of pounds of furniture just left to rot away, as the hotel closed down in . This comes as brave home buyers could own their own estate when a dilapidated country manor goes under the hammer for the first time in  years.Grade II-listed Bicton Manor lies in the Cornwall countryside and has far-reaching panoramic views into Dartmoor, Cornwall Live reports. Those brave enough to take on such a project would ideally have more than a few DIY skills or at least some power tools and paint brush. Agents describe it as as one of Cornwall’s most historical properties, with records that go back almost , years. It even has a mention in the Doomsday Book which was finished in .  Meanwhile, urban explorers have delivered a dferent view of one of the busiest spots in North Wales.The explorers, who wish to remain anonymous, discovered a concealed passage running underneath a bridge across the A at Colwyn Bay. As first reported by North Wales Live, the group entered the tunnel through a heavy steel lidded manhole and climbed down steel steps. Then they tried to cross to the other side of the bridge.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Gold medalBobsledproperty newsAbandoned places\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The family home, set across four floors, currently comes with a price tag of £, and includes its own games room and separate utility space.But competition appears to be tough with hundreds of new properties hitting the housing market each day in Yorkshire, reports Yorkshire Live.A toilet, kitchen, living room diner and the first of four bedrooms are spread across the ground floor while a separate reception room, utility room and storage area are found in the basement.  A built-in fireplace decorates the living room while the family kitchen comes with modern fixtures and fittings. On the first floor are the propertyaposs three additional bedrooms and a family bathroom which comes with a corner bathtub. The house, which is currently advertised through Purple Bricks, also features an attic room, off-road parking, double glazing and gas central heating.  The attic room is currently set up as a bedroom while a games room is set up where with its own bar area and enough space to house a snooker table. Photos show the garden with a grass lawn and raised decking which currently houses a hot tub. The house appears to be nestled within townhouses and bungalows on a residential street that backs onto an alleyway.  One neighbour commented online that they sold their property for £, more than the property in Huddersfield which is listed for £,. But they pointed out that the house was on a horrically busy road and that it was located near a Texaco petrol station within the residential area. The interior is going to give most people waking nightmares too, they added.  One homeowner said that they were able to sell their house immediately after they knocked £, off the asking price. Also commenting on price, another said: Clearly not desperate to move. Knock £, off it and be done. Or sit out another four years. Another person said: Anything is only worth what a buyer is willing to pay, not what the seller wants to charge.  A third added: It’s been up for sale for four years. It’s not priced competitively, or it would have sold years ago. It appears the sellers must have unrealistic expectations. It also appears they are in no rush to sell, which is fair enough,they’re happy to hang on to it until someone offers what they want, then they do right.  Others said that the propertyaposs four floors could be the problem, being less likely to appeal to families and older buyers. There lies the problem. It has four floors and itaposs too expensive, one person said. For that money, there are better houses with ground floor and upper floor. Not good with kids or elderly on four floors, another commented.

Ryan Sanderson, , was nine weeks into his female to male transition when he discovered that he was pregnant. The drama student, from Rochdale, Manchester, was stunned by the positive test - but decided to immediately pause his hormone treatments in order to give birth to son, Hendrick, two. Ryan claims he knew he was a man from the age of seven and had struggled with his gender identity since.But despite his dficulty with body dysphoria throughout the pregnancy, he was proud to give birth to his son and now looks forward to raising his small family. Ryan said: I didnapost believe I could get pregnant when on testosterone until I found out that I was. I think more trans-men need to understand that they can get pregnant. My ex-partner was under the impression that he was infertile, but that wasnapost the case. Iaposd struggled for so long to become my true self and had even had to go with a private GP in order to get testosterone. I knew that I was a man from the age of seven and came out at . Since coming out as Ryan, Iaposve felt this freedom that I never felt as a girl, I do things for me instead of what society deems certain genders should do.  I ended up finding out during a doctoraposs visit, that I was ten weeks pregnant after being on testosterone for nine weeks. It was a huge shock to the system, but even though I was worried about what coming off of testosterone may do to my body dysmorphia, I knew instantly that I wanted to have the baby. I believed it to be fate, Iaposve never been a devout follower of religion, but I felt like it was a sign to have a child before I was in too deep with testosterone treatments. When I found out I was pregnant, Hendrick truly became my everything. Despite struggling with body dysmorphia throughout, Ryan had the full support of his friends and family and said the pregnancy ran smoothly.  He said: My GP was slightly worried about complications, but the course of my pregnancy ran pretty smoothly. Thankfully, I had a wonderful team of midwives that would address me with the appropriate pronouns andthey made mistakes they would always apologise. Sometimes theyaposd have questions, and it felt great to be able to answer them without them trying to offend me in any way. He added: My mum, Janette, , has been super supportive the entire way through. Without her, Iaposd be lost, she does so much for both Hendrick and I and acts like a super-hero co-parent. Sheaposs read all of the books and understands the way in which Iaposd like him to be bought up.  My ex-partner doesnapost want to be in the picture, but Iaposve got the full support of the rest of my family and friends. Ryan is now embracing the experience of being a seahorse dad and enjoys sharing his experience of being trans and pregnant with others. The new dad was able to chest feed his son before undergoing top surgery to remove his breasts but now feels some sadness at not being able to feed any future children. Ryan said: I got to chest feed Hendrick when he was born, as I knew it was the healthiest and best way to aid him in his growth. In , I had top surgery to remove my breasts which felt amazing, although I am sad at the thought of not being able to chest feed any of my future children. Iaposd love to have a bigger family in the future, so Iaposm holding off on any more surgeries for now until there are more options that I am comfortable with. Itaposs so great being Hendrickaposs parent, being a dad just feels right to me. Iaposve had so many people stop me when Iaposve been out and about with him that comment on me being a good dad, it just feels incredible. Iaposm finally the person I want to be, and Iaposve got a mini-me to share that journey with.

Armed with AK-s, they are seen wearing masks as they flank their commander at an unknown location inside the war zone. The duo are among an estimated , foreign nationals who have travelled to Ukraine to fight since the conflict erupted. The Mirror interviewed them via phone from their base in Ukraine. One of the duo - who gave his name as James, from Manchester - arrived in Ukraine two weeks ago and is one of around  Brits to join the Georgian National Legion. The international band of volunteers have answered Ukraineaposs call for foreigners to help fight against the Russian invaders. James, , says he initially told his family he was travelling to help refugees and only later revealed his real intention to aposfight for freedomapos, despite having no military experience. Follow all todayaposs latest updates on the conflict with our live blog here  He told the Mirror: I only told them the truth when I got here as Iaposm not good with goodbyes. My mum was very supportive but my dad was a bit like aposughapos. I think they were worried for me.They are proud I am standing up for Ukraine but scared for my safety. If it comes down to it I am willing to die for this cause.I know I may neverhome butI die Iaposm dying for freedom. James says he was unemployed when the war in Ukraine erupted, although he said he used to work in warehouses, changing jobs every few weeks. He said: Iaposd been following the conflict in Ukraine for a while and then it blew out of the water.  I thought the only way I could help was getting boots on the ground. I caught a flight to Poland and then hitch-hiked to the border. I contacted the Georgian National Legion online and they came and picked me up from near the border. Since arriving two weeks ago, James says he has enrolled in basic training, with target practice, infantry tactics and first aid lessons taking up much of his time. He said: Theyaposve given me a Kalashnikov rle. Itaposs the first time Iaposve shot a gun.  It wasnapost what I was expecting. I got a bit of an adrenaline rush when I shot it, they arenapost toys. James said the dangerous reality of his new le became apparent within a few of joining the Georgian National Legion. On the first night, Iaposd only been here a few hours when there was an air raid. It made it feel very real, he said. There have been air raids basically every night. Itaposs crazy.The Brit added that Ukrainians are grateful that he and other foreigners are volunteering to fight against Russia. People really appreciate that weaposve come here. The people donapost feel alone now and that give me a warm feeling in my heart, he said. On Sunday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said , foreigners had applied to join Ukraineaposs military, with James revealing that there are around  British volunteers in his unit.He called on Boris Johnson to provide more supplies to Ukraine, including Stinger anti-air missiles.James says he plans to stay in Ukraine until the war is over and hopes to become a part of the countryaposs official armed forces in the future. Another Brit - who identied himself to the Mirror as Thomas, , from London - has also signed up with the Georgian National Legion.  Neither James nor Thomas wanted to reveal their surnames or their location in Ukraine due to security fears.Thomas told the Mirror he hopes to halt Putin aposs territorial expansion by pushing back the Russians in Ukraine.The former British Army soldier said: First of all it was Georgia, now itaposs Ukraine and next it will be London. Itaposs a three-hour flight here, itaposs quicker than going to Manchester and I would defend Manchester. Thomas says he decided to volunteer in Ukraine after realising that the people were willing to stand and fight for their country.  He said: I wouldnapost have come herethe people werenapost defending the country. Also when I saw civilians were dying I thought apositaposs timeapos. I want to make sure we are in this fight for as long as possible. He added: I got to Ukraine about a week ago. I first arrived in Warsaw and made my way to the border. When I got to the borderyou are resourceful enough itaposs a breeze . I met the Georgian National Legion at the border and they took me to where I am now.  At the moment Iaposm doing some training. Iaposm going through training in small arms, medical, battlefield casualty drills . Iaposm also training other recruits and making bombs. I want to get the recruits ready and work with them when we do go out. Thomas found out about the Georgian National Legion through mutual friends, including one pal who volunteered to fight Russian-backed rebels in Ukraine years ago. He quashed the belief that foreigners being thrown straight into battle after travelling to Ukraine.

After Harry and Meghanaposs engagement in , the couple gave an interview to the BBCaposs Mishal Hussein and recalled Meghanaposs first meeting with Kate. Harry said: It was exciting I mean I’ve — you know I’d been seeing her for a period of time when I literally didn’t tell anybody at all.  And then William was longing to meet her and so was Catherine, so you know, being our neighbours, we managed to get that in a couple of — well quite a few times now and Catherine has been absolutely… And Meghan with a one-word answer chipped in: Wonderful.

And we’ve had a really — she’s — she’s an incredible woman. However, since that engagement interview, a lot has changed for Harry and Meghan.

Mum-of-two Amber Fisher, , said she was faced with a pitul meal of only crisps, popcorn, chocolate and celery on the flight to the Dominican Republic. The hairdresser, from Isleworth, west London, suffers from coeliac disease and said the airlineaposs confusing website led her to believe she simply had to inform the crew of her allergy upon boarding to be given a gluten-free meal. But after boarding on Saturday, she was told by an air hostess that she was in fact supposed to book her meal in advance. Crew scraped together some gluten-free food from the onboard snacks and their own lunches, leaving her with a pitul meal of carrot and celery sticks, chocolate buttons, crisps, popcorn, nuts, chocolate bars and a tangerine.  But the handful of treats left the hairdresser so starving on the long haul flight to the Dominican Republic that she almost fainted and began vomiting. The mum added the experience ruined her trip as it gave her major anxiety for the rest of her holiday. Amber complained about her experience online to raise awareness of the issues faced by coeliacs but was branded a dramatic idiot by commenters who claimed she should have known to prebook her special meal. British Airways said they take customersapos allergies and dietary requirements extremely seriously but, like other airlines, ask customers to let them knowthey would like a special meal at least  hours before their flight.  Amber said: The air hostess said aposweaposll have to see what we can doapos and then brought me that. She said aposweaposve taken food out of the crew food tooapos which was basically carrot sticks and celery sticks. I was like aposfor nine hours you expect me to eat this apos and she was like aposthataposs all we haveapos. It was a pitul amount of food. I ate the whole lot but itaposs like what youaposd give a kid while watching a film, itaposs not an adult meal thataposs going to fill you up. She added: I was on really strong antibiotics and hadnapost eaten in the morning so I was just starving and it was a nightmare. I nearly passed out at the end because I hadnapost eaten and felt really weak because of the antibiotics.  I actually started vomiting into a bag as we were coming down. It was just water because my stomach was so empty. It ruined the holiday because it gave me major anxiety for days and I just felt crappy. The mum said she was shocked by her in-flight meal which was all the more disappointing when compared to the full spread of a hot meal, side, snack and pudding that was offered to her non-coeliac fiance. She blamed the airlineaposs confusing website for the mix-up, which says that passengers with allergies must inform [the] cabin crew of [their] food allergy upon boarding. However, the site also states that customers can order special meals, including a gluten-free option, which should be requested at least  hours before [their] flight departs.  Amber said that despite the flight attendant assuring her that her dietary requirements would be logged for all future BA flights, the crew again failed to provide gluten-free food for her on theflight ten days later. Amber said: On the BA website it states that you have to ask when you get on board and when I told the flight attendant she started arguing with me asI was lying. I showed her what it said on the website and she just said aposoh thataposs confusing isnapost itapos. I emailed and complained and they just said aposweaposre very sorry about this, this isnapost our usual practice. We hope you have a better flight next time.apos No compensation, no nothing. Youaposre paying to be on a flight, you donapost expect someone to basically tell you that youaposre lying. Itaposs massively put me off going with them again. The air hostess said aposdonapost worry weaposll get it registered so every time you come on a BA flight youaposll automatically get itapos but when I got on the flight back they just automatically gave me normal food. So they didnapost even look into what was on my chair or that Iaposd applied for this meal. I just gave it to my partner.Amber was diagnosed as coeliac in  after she began to struggle to keep food down. Since then she has been unable to eat any wheat, gluten or barley because her severe allergy would make her ill for days. The hairdresser said she often faces criticism and doubt from people about her condition, with many mistaking it for a dietary choice rather than an allergy. Amber said: I basically couldnapost digest any food, I was throwing up everything I was eating the next morning and losing loads of weight. I canapost have anything to this day - I would have brain fog for days, sweat and shake, be physically sick and look pregnant because of bloating. People think youaposre making it up and when you say you have a gluten allergy youaposre being a a and you just donapost want gluten because you want to lose weight. But with me thataposs just not the case, Iaposm severely allergic to it. After posting about her experience online, Amber was bombarded with negative comments from unsympathetic people pointing out that she misinterpreted the airlineaposs website and saying she shouldaposve known to prebook her food. One commenter said: Youaposre an idiot then. Everyone knows to pre-order foodthey have a special diet...Personal responsibility is a wonderful thing. Another said: Wow! Seriously, take your own foodyou have allergies intolerances. Get a grip of yourself no one would feel faint after eating all that food, albeit junk. Take some personal responsibility, you didnapost order a meal and the crew have managed to provide you with the best options they had in a metal tub, , feet up in the air. Other commenters slammed the mum as dramatic for her description of the physical impact of the lack of food during the nine-hour flight and for saying the experience ruined her holiday. One said: Letaposs not be dramatic, I doubt [she] actually aposnearly passed outapos [...] Furthermore, Iaposm a bit concerned that this would ruin an entire holiday...seems a bit dramatic.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  But she has hit back, urging people to be more understanding of the dficulties faced by coeliacs. Amber said: I was annoyed by the comments I got. I think people who donapost have allergies just donapost understand. I think BA handled it in a very inhumane way, expecting a grown adult to eat barely anything for nine hours on a flight. It makes you feel like you donapost matter and youaposre not as good as everyone  because you have an allergy. Other commenters tried to defend Amber and branded those who were unsympathetic as aposheartlessapos. One said: No one should be treated like that, poor lady. She certainly doesnapost deserve cruel comments. Letaposs all try to be kinder. A spokesperson for British Airways said: We take all of our customersapos allergies and dietary requirements extremely seriously and our catering teams work extremely hard to ensure everyone has the meal they want, every time they travel. All our customers can pre-request one of  special meals free of charge, including gluten-free meals, up to  hours before their flight.

Shellie Mullen, , said she broke down on the spot when she ed to her old home in Cramlington, Northampton, in January - only to find it had been completely cleared.Among the items chucked in the skip were family photographs, hospital wrist bands from when her children were born, and her granddadaposs war medals, Shellie said. She was there to pack up her familyaposs belongings before moving to their new home - which was supposed to be a fresh start for her son, , and daughter, .But the move has turned into a living nightmare because they donapost have the items they need to make their new house a home, she told Chronicle Live.The family moved out of the house - owned by property management firm Places for People - in September last year before moving in with Shellieaposs mum.The council put them on a priority list to be rehomed, but Shellie continued to pay rent to the housing provider in full through her Universal Credit.She told Chronicle Live: I still had access to the house - and Iaposd go there to check on our things quite often.  When we found out weaposd finally secured a new property in Newcastle in January, I went with my family to pack up our things. To my horror - the place was completely empty. I broke down on the spot. Places for People have apologised for the upset caused but say they asked Shellie to empty the property in December. Shellie said that when she called her housing officer, she was given attitude and told her things had been taken to the tip. My whole le was gone she said. Thousands of pounds worth of stuff and so many memories lost.Furniture is replaceable, but I canapost stop thinking about our pictures, wrist bands from when the kids were born, my grandadaposs war medals and our birth certicates. Nothing could be salvaged and Iaposve had no help from the company since. Shellie said she was told by the company that they believed the house had been abandoned. She admits they had contacted her in December, but she said she couldnapost get through when she attempted to contact them by phone. She said the housing company later informed her that they had tried to contact her mum, but that this was inappropriate given that she has dementia.  A few days before the possessions were taken, Shellie also said she had been at the house and that there was no notice anywhere on the property. She has since lodged a formal complaint with the company.One of Shellieaposs friends has since set up a GoFundMe page to try and raise funds for the family to furnish their new house.Responding to the support sheaposs received, Shellie said: Everybody has really rallied around us, with lots of people from the local area helping. Itaposs been overwhelming because Iaposve never been in need like this before, and itaposs nice to know that people are so kind. A spokesperson for Places for People said: “We are sorry this situation has caused upset at a dficult time. We have been in contact with Miss Mullen since June , and most recently in December, when we asked Miss Mullen to empty the property. We extended the dates to allow Miss Mullen to move her items after her tenancy had ended, before we arranged for the property to be cleared. We have been in touch with Miss Mullen to explain the actions that were taken to keep our homes and customers safe.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mental healthHousingHousing benefit\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The school has to send out emails regularly telling people to take care and drive safely, also asking people to take photos of offending cars which they suggest to send to the council.I am so proud of my girl for raising awareness about this and trying to create a safer environment for all children there, and other pedestrians and drivers too. It is so busy and so dangerous when people are careless about where they park. Programme manager Hema, of Gillingham, described some of these offenses as cars parked on no parking zones.She says parents regularly park on zig-zag and double yellow lines placed around the school area which make it impossible to see oncoming traffic. Hema and her husband, , have been going out to speak to the drivers parked in places they shouldnapost be for two and a half years. They would take pictures of the cars and then report them to Medway Council.Hema explains: We have been doing this since September in  - but nothing has changed. It is so frustrating because people are putting their convenience over the safety of the children. We are unsure of what action the council has taken, as itaposs still a regular issue. We have seen traffic wardens a few times but ultimately we think thataposs not a good enough deterrent. If the council could issue warnings and or other fines to those iniduals who repeatedly park dangerously, it might help stop them. However, on Friday January , Hemaaposs husband - who asked to not be named - had an altercation with one of the school mums, which ended up turning violent.The woman was being very aggressive and threatening to get physical, says Hema.When we told the school, they said to report it to the police. So we did, but nothing came of it because they said there is not much they could do. All we wanted was for the police to get involved because we feel people would then take more notice. The problem is we arenapost being taken seriously! The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

The settlement is said to run into millions of pounds - and reports today suggest that Andrewaposs older brother Prince Charles is lending him some of the money.According to the Sun, he is allowing the Duke of York to borrow £million with others including the Queen also chipping in with their private cash.Speaking on the decision to loan Andrew the money, a source told the newspaper that family discussions took place about how to take a little from here and a little from there.  Andrew will reportedly pay his brother and the Queen back when he gets his cash from the sale of his ski chalet in Verbier, Switzerland, which could take two months. But despite Charles, seemingly assisting his younger brother, the pair have had a rocky relationship in the past. Despite being brothers, the pair had very dferent upbringings and have also had very dferent adult lives. And it appears there have been several incidents - partly driven by Charles’ desire for a slimmed-down Monarchy - that have proved there has been tension between them… Dferent childhoods Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up . Charles is the eldest son of the Queen and the late Prince Philip with his birth coming in .Andrew was born in  - meaning there is an age gap of  years, so the pair didn’t really grow up together. But despite having the same parents, it seems that Charles and Andrew had very dferent experiences growing up.Experts believe the Queen has long felt the weight of raising Charles to be the next king - but with Andrew, she is said to have a far more hands-on relationship. Royal author Katie Nicholl told the documentary: There is a real tension between Charles and Andrew. Andrew has a very dferent relationship with his mother and the Queen was much more hands-on. Princess Dianaaposs former butler Paul Burrell added: Andrew has always been the Queenaposs favourite son and he has never done anything wrong in her eyes. While journalist Penny Junor said: I think the Queen has always had a bit of a blind spot when it comes to Prince Andrew. Close wives In the s, both Princes were granted grand weddings when they wed their respective ex-wives - Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson. Diana and Sarah knew each other before becoming royal, and their bond tightened when they joined The Firm, often pictured chatting at events such as Ascot and Wimbledon.They even took their children on skiing holidays together with Fergie frequently describing Diana as her best friend. This meant Charles and Andrew also spent a lot of time together, with royal expert Katie Nicholl noting the brothers had more companionship between them at that stage in their le than perhaps at any other. However, neither marriage lasted and both were orced by . Slimmed-down monarchy  As heir to the throne, Charles has spent his entire le preparing for the day he takes to the throne to become King.And it’s long been reported that he plans for a slimmed-down monarchy with a team of seven senior royals - that doesn’t include Prince Andrew or his daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.This came to a head in , when Beatrice and Eugenie were stripped of their -hour taxpayer-funded security.And one royal expert said Charles was forced to intervene in the debate about funding for Beatrice and Eugenieaposs security after it caused a row behind palace walls.It is thought the heir to the throne stepped in after the younger of his nieces racked up huge security costs as she travelled the world on her gap year. A report published at the time suggested Eugenie spent more than £, of taxpayersapos money as she explored India, America, Thailand and South Africa.  Charles reportedly stepped in to control the spending, with royal author Angela Levin telling the programme Beatrice and Eugenie: Pampered Princesses  he suggested the sisters didnapost need costly security as itaposs unlikely they will ever become working royals. But Charlesaposs suggestion didnapost go down well and is said to have left Andrew furious. Meanwhile another incident between the brothers also reportedly left Andrew angry. It came in  when the Queen was celebrating her Diamond Jubilee and an appearance by the royals on the Buckingham Palace balcony was planned.It was reported that Charles had a hand in the decision for only senior royals, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, to appear on the balcony - leaving Andrew dismayed. Royal expert Richard Kay wrote in the Daily Mail in : For Andrew, according to one close figure, being excluded from the balcony scene was a sudden and totally unexpected demotion from front-rank to peripheral royal. It was ‘like a dagger to his heart and he hasn’t got over it’.But this was a dramatic statement of intent by Charles, who long ago decided that when he is king the Royal Family would be ‘slimmed down’. But as a friend of the Duke of York says: ‘The speed and suddenness with which Charles has acted has taken Andrew’s breath away. It’s dreadfully high-handed.’ Stripping titles  Last year, Virginia Giuffre began the process of suing Andrew in a civil case in New York for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. Andrew vehemently denies all allegations. While waiting for the case to come up in court, Buckingham Palace announced that Andrew would not undertake any public duties and that his military associations and royal patronages have been ed to the Queen. Charles is said to have had a hand in the decision to remove Andrew’s titles - along with his son William.And royal expert Robert Jobson said they had no other choice. He told the Mirror: “Prince Andrew will be devastated at the way he has been cut adrt by the royal family. But the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William - the main players in this shocking move - will feel they had no choice.” After Buckingham Palaceaposs announcement, a reporter asked Charles a question about Andrew, but he didnapost answer. Settling the case  Last month, the news came that Andrew and Virginia Giuffre had come to an out-of-court deal - and that the case would not proceed to trial.And according to sources, it was Charles along with the Queen who put substantial pressure on Andrew to settle the case. The Firm is said to have wanted a settlement agreed so the case did not overshadow the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. Well placed royal sources previously said Andrew was under “intense pressure from the very top” to ensure a deal was done after a US judge rejected the duke’s bid to have the case dismissed. Her Majesty took advice from Charles and William who were summoned to meet her at Windsor Castle minutes after Andrew broke the news. A source said: “It was made absolutely crystal clear to Andrew he has to sort this mess out. “It would have been unthinkable for the case to have reached trial under the glare of the international media. “It has been a disaster from the start and everyone was in agreement it had not only destroyed his reputation but had the capacity to seriously damage that of the monarchy as well. In such an important year for the Queen, enough was enough.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They recalled: HM would relish seeing Don because she would know he always had a fresh supply of jokes, but his sense of humour was pretty salty, according to MyLondon.On one occasion, during a naval ceremony, Mr Gosling was seated one place away from The Queen, with Labour Defence Secretary Fred Mulley in between them.

The Minister put up his hand and stopped Don, obviously thinking the Queen shouldn’t be exposed to such ribaldry. HM was furious - and berated poor Mulley for ruining the joke. She made Don tell the whole joke all over again, and shrieked with laughter at the punchline, which was about the horse winning against stf competition or something like that. But Her Majesty doesnapost just like to listen to jokes, she is well known for pulling a prank or two of her own. On one occasion, when her right-hand woman Angela Kelly played a cruel practical joke on her, she responded in a typical witty way - by jokingly telling her she was sacked. Angela, who has worked for the Queen for many years, revealed the trick she played on her boss during a Royal Tour of Australia in .Writing in her book The Other Side of the Coin, the dresser said she bought a stuffed toy version of a kookaburra and convinced a horried Queen that it was a dead one. Having purchased the toy at a nearby market, Kelly then placed it in a birdcage on the balcony outside the royal suite in Governor’s House. She recalled: “The Queen looked outside and shouted aposItaposs a kookaburra!apos “I went to open the cage and she said loudly, ‘No! Don’t do that! It will fly away!apos Turning to her Majesty while trying to keep a straight face, I solemnly told her it was dead.

Mr McKeague, of Dunfermline, Fe, was  when he vanished in the early hours of September , , after a night out in Bury St Edmunds.Suffolk Police believe the airman, who was stationed at RAF Honington, climbed into a bin which was then tipped into a waste lorry. Mr McKeague’s father Martin McKeague said in a statement read by lawyer Peter Taheri, counsel to the inquest: “Corrie was a happy child, however there were major events that shaped Corrie’s le.“When Corrie was  years old Nicolaand I had separated. “At the age of , when he was first to find the body of his friend who had just been killed on a train line, I believe Corrie developed a signicant binge-drinking problem. “In his teenage years that impacted his emotional wellbeing and mired many of his relationships. “Following a visit to my home town in Cupar in  shortly before his disappearance I once again had to have words with him about it.  “We had a falling out over it.” He said that his last contact with his son was on his birthday, September , “when I sent him a message to wish him a happy birthday and I sent him money”. He said the death of his son’s friend “was a terrible shock for a -year-old boy to suffer, and one I don’t think he ever truly got over”.  Mr McKeague continued: “I don’t believe Corrie was ever suicidal. “This has been a heartbreaking tragedy.” Mr McKeague’s mother Nicola Urquhart, in a statement read to the inquest in Ipswich by lawyer Andrew Walker, said one of her son’s “very close female friends was hit by a train and killed instantly”. “This event had a huge impact on Corrie,” she said. She said Mr McKeague had started to train as a hairdresser, then as a PE teacher, before joining the RAF.While he was prescribed antidepressants in the past, she said he was “back to his usual happy self” by . Ms Urquhart said her son “regularly lost his phone or wallet on nights out” but “was never aggressive with or without alcohol”. “There was nothing to suggest Corrie had any problems or concerns around the time of his disappearance,” she said. She said he had told her that he had “bumped a taxi on one occasion, meaning he had run off without paying”. She said that “ a stranger asked him to get into his boot to go to a party” she believed that he would go. “Despite what’s in the press, as far as I’m aware Corrie had never slept in a bin nor had he ever climbed into a bin to sleep,” Ms Urquhart said.  Mr McKeague’s brother Darroch McKeague said in a statement that Corrie planned to come back to Scotland for Halloween. He said that when he spoke to his brother on September  he was “happy” and “looking forward to his night out”. Suffolk’s senior coroner Nigel Parsley said Mr McKeague, who had served in the RAF for three years, drank a “signicant amount of alcohol during the evening” of September .  He said Mr McKeague was asked to leave Flex nightclub and “was seen on a number of occasions on CCTV”. “He’s seen to sometimes be alone, sometimes in conversation with others and seen to obtain food,” Mr Parsley said. He said that at .am on September  CCTV captured Mr McKeague entering a horseshoe-shaped area in Brentgovel Street.“You might find based on evidence that .am is the last time Corrie was seen and known to be alive,” Mr Parsley told jurors.

And the highly anticipated interview saw the couple lt the lid on le behind Palace walls and make several shocking allegations about their family. Some of the issues raised by the pair threw up more questions about their time as senior working royals - and despite the past  months, some of these questions still remain... Who is the aposroyal racistapos  One of the most shocking lines from Harry and Meghanaposs bombshell tell-all interview was a claim that Harry had conversations within the royal household about how dark son Archieaposs skin might have been before he was born.During the interview, Meghan refused to say who the conversations had been with, saying it would be very damaging to them. Later in the chat, Harry also said he would never reveal the details of the conversations - although it was later reported the comments were not made by the Queen or the late Duke of Edinburgh.

Click here to sign up .After the interview aired, a statement was issued by the Queen, which read: The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. Whilst some recollections may y, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much-loved family members. Meanwhile, Prince William hit back at the claims and insisted they were very much not a racist family when asked by a reporter. However, the identity of the person alleged to have made the comments is still to be revealed. Who denied Meghan help for her mental health  During the interview, Meghan opened up about her mental health struggles and admitted she had suicidal thoughts during her time in the royal family.She explained how she didnapost want to be alive anymore and when asked directlyshe was thinking of self-harm and having suicidal thoughts at some stage, Meghan replied yes. Meghan says that Harry cradled her when she told him, and he later admitted it sent him to a dark place. When she asked the palace to seek professional help, Meghan said she was told she couldnapost get any - how it is still not known who told Meghan she was not allowed to seek help. What really went on between Meghan and Kate   There were numerous reports that Meghan made the Duchess of Cambridge cry during a bridesmaid dress fitting in the lead up to her wedding to Harry.But during her one-on-one with Oprah, Meghan claimed it was actually Kate that made her cry.Meghan said she has now forgiven Kate, adding that sheaposs a good person and that Kate sent her flowers to apologise for the incident - although gave no details on what sparked the incident, and it is still not known for certain. What caused the rt with William  Before the interview, there had been much speculation about the growing rt between Harry and his older brother William. It was reportedly sparked by Williamaposs concerns over Harryaposs fast-developing relationship with Meghan and the tense row quickly boiled over. The younger prince then claimed in the Oprah interview that his brother was trapped within the royal system - although did not go into detail over what caused their reported feud. Why did Charles stop taking Harryaposs calls  Another bombshell made by Harry came when he said he felt let down by his father Prince Charles and was cut off financially. He also claimed that his dad stopped taking his calls - but there has been no further detail on why this was the case.

The TikToker found the terrying discovery behind a wall in the attic of his Welsh home. He had been trying to plug the gaps of a wall in his home with insulation material when he spotted something behind the bricks. It was part of a renovation project which he had been recording on the social networking  TikTok. But TikTok user @geebeetv made a chilling discovery behind a bricked-up wall in his attic. North Wales Live reports he discovered a locked wooden box, with a pentagram carved on one side of the box, and the words peidiwch ar ryddhau in Welsh which roughly translates to do not release. A week later, while continuing renovating the room he noticed a mirror in the corner that rattled when he moved it, but the edges had been sealed shut. Curiosity got the better of him so he took a hammer and smashed the glass - a move which according to superstition brings seven years of bad luck. Behind the mirror, someone had hidden the key to the locked chest found earlier.According to their most recent clip, million people watched the video clips and hundreds of people warned the man to leave the box alone. But others, like him, were dying to see what was inside and were fascinated by the mystery. Some really strange objects were inside, including a small pendant necklace and a burned piece of an ouija board.A lock of hair and a second key were also left inside the box - raising the questionthere is a second key, is there a second box  Thousands of people commented on the ious clips, with some calling the videos staged, while others are terried by what they’ve seen.

The sister is apparently close with the former fiancée and still hangs out with her. This is despite her brother being uncomfortable with the set-up, with his ex-partner having hurt him badly.Things have recently taken an unfortunate turn for the worse after it emerged his sister was actually going on holiday with the ex, with the pair heading off to the beautul Amalfi Coat together. To rub salt in the wound, this holiday had originally been intended as the now-cancelled honeymoon. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the dismayed former groom-to-be recalled how he learned the news from his parents, whoaposd revealed his ex and his sister had been over to theirs for a family lunch.He wrote: I was upset. My ex and I haven’t spoken since she called off the wedding, so I assumed she came over for me. I pressed my parents for more information. They told me my sister and my ex were going on vacation together to the Amalfi coast. That was supposed to be our honeymoon. I felt sick to my stomach that my ex was taking my sister on our honeymoon. Frustratingly, the sister has been unable to see how badly this decision might affect her heartbroken brother, lashing out in anger and called him an a**hole for being unhappy about her holiday plans.The poster - who goes by the username u Ancient-Books - continued: She told me she’s allowed to have friends. She doesn’t need my permission for anything. She told me she loves me, but she can’t put her le on hold for me.I wasn’t asking her to put her le on hold, just not go on my honeymoon and not be friends with my ex. I always knew she had a little crush on my ex, and I told her my ex isn’t gonna date her, not even out of desperation. She hung up on me and refused to call me back.  The next day, it became apparent that the sister had told their parents all about the disagreement, who both told him how disappointed they were in me. He added: They told me it was a low blow, and I need to get over myself. I didn’t expect them to take sides at all, but they’re refusing to see my point of view. Now both the sister and the ex are refusing to speak with him, and the poster has been left wondering whether on not heaposs overreacted a bit. Clarying the situation to some suspicious Reddit users, the poster explained that his ex called off the wedding after she caught him having a weekly lunch with an old flame, and assumed he was cheating on her. He remains adamant that this wasnapost the case. However, a number of commenters have been less than sympathetic, feeling the poster was being rather cagey about the reasons behind the split, which he didnapost want to get into. Many also found the secret weekly lunches - as platonic as they might have been - to be a bit shady. One person wrote: Pro tip for any relationship:you’re keeping a secret from your partner, they’re going to reasonably assume that you’re doing something secretive. He eroded the trust in his own relationship by doing something distrustful: not the lunches themselves, but lying about them. However, others saw his point of view, with another commenting: Your sister can be friends with whoever she wants but seems like she doesnapost give an f**k about how it makes you feel that she still is friends with your ex, not to mention going on a vacation honeymoon together. You have every right to be mad, donapost let them manipulate you into feeling youaposre in the wrong here.Do you have an awkward break-up story to share  We pay for stories.

He had just a backpack, a plastic bag, his passport and a telephone number written on his hand, according to the Slovak Ministry of Interior.

Ukrainian politician Anton Herashchenko, advisor at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, shared translations of the phone calls online. It comes after captured Russian troops complained about being deceived by Putin in a string of videos released by Ukraine. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog here  In one intercepted conversation shared by Mr Herashchenko, a Russian soldier reportedly moans: We have no aviation, no f***ing support, we are like cannon fodder. According to the Sun, he added that he would do anything to come back home... resign from the army, I donapost give a f***. The soldier revealed that his comrades were looking forward to the end of the war as fighting for no reason had f***ed everyone up.  In another leaked recording, a Russian infantryman complained that his battalion was facing massacres and said his comrades were shaking, afraid and refusing to fight.A third soldier called his we, it is claimed, and told her:Russia itself attacked Ukraine, why I donapost understand. Weaposre definitely here until May, thataposs for certain.He warned the war could drag on for a couple of years.  Another Russian fighter said he was being paid £ a day - a relatively high wage in Russia - but said no-one cared about the money anymore. He echoed other soldiersapos wishes to quit the army and said his comrades were sleeping in the street. Weaposre running out of diesel fuel, ammunition level is low too. I donapost know what the f*** weaposre going to do, he added.  Russian forces have lost , troops a-day to a ferocious defence from Ukrainian troops and defiant citizen warriors, according to official Ukrainian numbers. The loss of , soldiers, sailors and airmen by day  of the invasion has been a massive blow to Moscow, which is now calling up reserves. Defence experts usually calculate invading commanders usually need an advantage in numbers of around three to one to attack a defending force.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter In house to house combat in inner cities, which is what Moscow is attempting, this calculation can be as many as four to one needed.It is estimated that Russia began the invasion with around , troops, in Belarus to the north, on the eastern flank and offshore in the Black Sea.  That is only a few thousand more than Ukraine ’s entire armed forces, it is believed, but the defenders were better-trained.And by adopting a full-on assault offensive on towns and cities that are well defended by a well-motivated force the Russian troops are now mired in urban combat.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

I don’t think they have the right to do this.##You could pay at the desk and also get a monthly membership for £ or, as I did, a family yearly one for £, including use of the hot tub and sauna steam room,# Mrs MacPherson continued.Crerar Hotels said that there were no planning stipulations regarding who might use the facilities.A spokesperson for the company added: #Following a six-figure refurbishment, our brand-new Shore Spa is scheduled to open at the end of March.#It will offer additional therapy suites and a renovated pool with heated beds and swan-neck pool fountains, as well as thermal experiences including a healing Himalayan salt room, eucalyptus steam treatment and sauna alongside a brand-new terrace with loch-side saunas and ice drenches, plus further improvements to the existing hydro experience.#Shore Spa, including the pool, will be open to all, locals and residents alike.#Day passes, as well as annual spa memberships for access to the pool and thermal experiences for over-s, will be available and we#ll be announcing details # including costs # in due course.#We are, of course, offering a very dferent service to that of the excellent community pool in nearby Lochgilphead or the superb facilities at Atlantis in Oban, and our pricing will reflect that.#The company said the hotel supports  full-time and flexible positions worth £, annually to the Inveraray economy and brings the spending power of more than , visitors to the area every year as well as providing work for #countless# local suppliers and tradespeople.The spokesperson concluded: #Over the years further support has been given via the Crerar Trust charity, distributed to Argyll community projects, including in Inveraray.#Being engaged with the local community is important for all of the group’s hotel and inns, and something Crerar Hotels is delighted to do.#But Anne MacPherson summed up the concern of many locals as she concluded: #All I#m looking for is to be able to continue swimming on a daily basis without having to have spa treatments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhatever the rights and wrongs of Putin#s invasion of Ukraine, which has been shocking to witness from afar, one thing has shone through.The courage of the Ukranian people should serve as inspiration to each of us to stand against tyranny, in all its forms.As ever when the powerful invoke conflict, it#s the not-so-powerful and less wealthy who bear the brunt.

Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy.

The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to

need,’ said Joan Stewart, Shopper-Aide project manager.The building has been altered to suit Shopper-Aide’s needs, with the creation of a reception office space, a group meeting room, a private office and accessible toilets, in addition to the laundry room that was already in the building.There is also a kitchen where Shopper-Aide hopes to make soup which will be sold to the public twice a week.While there are still some small additions to be made to the building, Joan said Andrew Smith, Shopper-Aide’s new landlord, and local tradesmen who have carried out work so far, have been ‘brilliant’ in helping get things up and running.When Shopper-Aide was first set up, to help people aged  and over with their grocery shopping, it was dependent on external funders to operate and pay staff salaries.Over the years, as it began to offer more services including household support, a befriending service and organising social clubs like Elderberries and Garry’s Gang according to clients’ needs and abilities, the charity introduced new initiatives to help generate its own funds.These include selling crafts created by clients at its art and crafts clubs and donated second-hand

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the

That is within expectations but what that does do is underpins the  date so I think we are more confident now that that will be the date.“One success we got from the Hunterston end-of-generation is we managed to find a job for everybody who wanted to stay here.“The staff levels do go down, there’s no doubt about it, but I’ve just done it.“Hunterston was the first station of the AGR [advanced gas-cooled reactor] fleet to reach the end of generation. I was there, I saw it all, so I’m well positioned to help Torness on their journey. We will be starting our preparations for that in the next couple of years.”Once the station stops generating power, attention will turn to defueling the reactors.That process is expected to take more than three years and will require hundreds of members of staff.Mr Forrest succeeded Tam Al Bishawi, who has moved to EDF’s new Hinkley C power station in Somerset after  years over two spells at the station.However, the -year-old is no stranger to Torness.He has lived in nearby Dunbar for more than  years and has a connection with the power station dating back more than  years.He was involved in the construction and commissioning of the station and has held ious roles, including operations manager and technical and safety manager.He was also plant manager at Torness for nearly two years from December  to September , when he was appointed acting station director at Hunterston B, near West Kilbride in Ayrshire.The “strong supporter” of nuclear power felt that Torness had an important role to play in the years ahead.The father-of-three said: “I will be painting that picture and, as I said, at Hunterston we managed to find a job for everybody who wanted to stay.

If you visit The Lawn, with or without a booked stay at The Marine, always ask for Richie!Cocktails created by talented bar staff are the perfect dinner treat Staff are faultless in their presentation, their unorm neat and matching they’re eager to help and accommodate.Marine Hotel North Berwick Without a doubt, the staff are among the most polite and caring I have ever met. A special mention goes to Surajit Dasgupta for his outstanding care and attention throughout the stay. His service alone would justy booking a night’s stay at The Marine.The atmosphere and charm of this hotel is so special that, despite living just a few miles down the road, it felt like a well-needed break from day-to-day le. This does not give you the routine chain hotel vibe, instead a comfortable stay high up on my list of places to .

The former Scotland internationalist captained Dundee United to the Premier Division title and two League Cup triumphs and played alongside some of the best players to ever grace the Tannadice turf.When he runs the rule over the current crop, he believes there is one player who stands out amongst the crowd: Mulgrew. And with promising youngsters scattered throughout the squad, Hegarty believes there are few better role models to learn from than the -year-old centre-half.“They are aiming to bring young players through – as long as the standard is good and they can handle first-team football,” Hegarty explained. “That’s my only concern with youngsters at any club.“Sometimes they play for three or four games and then come out again. I’d like them to stake a claim for their position and go on to bigger and better things. “But they’ve got a lot of experience at the club. Charlie Mulgrew has done exceptionally well. He’s definitely surprised me in terms of being a leader. He’s a good type on and off the park and he’s just done exceptionally well.“Ryan Edwards and Ross Graham have definitely benefited from Charlie’s wisdom and his footballing ability. I don’t know Charlie, I’ve never met him, but what I see from this season he’s done very well.”Hegarty continued: “I thinkyou ask most fans at any club, the most pleasure you get is seeing young local players coming through the ranks to the first team. In our day we had David Narey, John Holt, Graeme Payne, Davie Dodds, John Reilly – a host of local players.“I know the game has changed a bit for getting players in but there’s nothing better than supporting the team and seeing local players on your doorstep playing first-team football. That’s probably their aim but I go back to what I said before: as long as they are quality.“They have got to handle the pressure, they have to handle first-team football. If they can do that, good on them. The one that’s really surprised me, and he’s done really well, is Ross Graham.“He was on loan at Dunfermline and he did reasonably well – he’s quite an old-fashioned centre-back. He clears his lines, he can play football when needed and he makes more right decisions than wrong decisions. When you do that as a footballer, you’re going to be successful.“Hes a goal threat as well, he’s decent in the air and scored a great goal a couple of weeks ago. He has probably benefitted from Charlie Mulgrew’s experience alongside him because Charlie pulls his ropes.“Charlie is calm under pressure, he takes an extra touch or an extra second because his knowledge of the game is really good and that rubs off on Ryan Edwards and Ross Graham.”Hegarty accepts that the odds will be stacked against Courts’ side on Monday night when Ange Postecolgou’s league leaders come to town but he believes that the one thing United cannot do is sit back and await the inevitable. Their only shot at victory, he says, is to take the game to Celtic – not to the extent that they leave themselves vulnerable at the back, but enough to make le dficult for the visitors.It is a ploy that has reaped rewards for United in fixtures with both halves of the Old Firm this term and Hegarty reckons it is Courts’ best chance of progressing to the semi-final at Hampden, eventhe last meeting between the two teams was a little one-sided.“They drew with Celtic - at Parkhead, lost - at Tannadice and took a doing at Tannadice -,” he recalled. “It was three going on seven or eight,we are truthful. But they did really well against Rangers as well.“With Celtic coming up on Monday in the cup tie they really have to go and put pressure on Celtic. If you allow them to play football they will pass you to death and they will score eventually. The boy [Tom] Rogic in the last game was exceptional, absolutely fantastic. One of his two goals was superb.“When they beat Rangers - at Tannadice at the start of the season they closed them down. That’s what they have to do against Celtic. Just take a chance becauseyou don’t take a chance they will be out of the cup because it’s a one-off.“Without being gung-ho or stupid about it, put them under pressure and ask them some questions and seethey can handle it. I think our fans would love them to have a go against Celtic on Monday night without being silly.”Paul Hegarty was promoting exclusively live Premier Sports coverage of Dundee v Rangers this Sunday from .pm and Dundee United v Celtic this Monday from .pm. Premier Sports is available on Sky, Virgin TV and the Premier Player from £. per month, and on Amazon Prime as an add-on subscription."},{"url":null,"title":"four-players-called-scotland-six-nations-squad-ahead-italy-clash","story":"Meanwhile, five players dropped out of the squad through injury. They are Edinburgh duo Marshall Sykes [second-row] and Nick Haining [back-row], and Glasgow trio Oli Kebble [prop], Ollie Smith [full-back] and Rufus McLean [wing]. Stand-off Hastings was a surprise omission from the initial training squad when it was announced in mid-January, with head coach Gregor Townsend insisting at the time that selection had been based on club form. The -year-old marshalled Gloucester to a bonus-point win over Northampton Saints on Saturday and assistant coach Pieter de Villiers insisted that he is has not been brought into camp just to make up the numbers. Finn Russell – as one of the few genuinely world class players in the squad – remains first choice stand-off, but he hasn’t hit his best for yet during this championship, so the Scotland selection  may take the view that Saturday’s game against an Italian side who have not tasted victory in this competition since  is the ideal opportunity to freshen things up. “Nobody is un-droppable,” stressed assistant coach Pieter de Villiers yesterday. “It is important to keep competition going and to reward players who get back to their strengths.  “We want to build continuity, but we also want to reward some people, to add to our depth and keep players believing.  “I think the competition is of a high standard at the moment and it is great to see Adam back in great form for his club,” he added. “He is happy to be back in the Scotland squad and we are very happy to see him here, so hopefully there are opportunities coming. “It is important for to keep players on form involved and reward them for what they have been doing up until now well.” Hastings’ recall may also be related to the prospect of Duhan van der Merwe missing the Italian match through suspension. The winger was red carded after his forearm made contact with fellow Scotland squad member Kyle Rowe’s face during Saturday’s English Premiership match between Worcester Warriors and London Irish.  His disciplinary hearing is tonight at pm andhe is suspended then there is a good chance that Blair Kinghorn – who has been back-up stand-off during the first three rounds of tis Six Nations – will be redeployed on the wing, leaving Scotland short of options in the No  channel. Elsewhere, de Villiers indicated that Matt Fagerson is shaping up well for ato the side after not making the France match due to a foot injury. “He’s been training with the squad so I’m quietly optimistic,” said the scrum expert. De Villiers also revealed that -year-old prop Murphy Walker, who signed his first senior contract with Glasgow in January, will train with Scotland this week but will not be officially added to the squad. Italy’s recent record in the Six Nations might be poor, and Scotland are in desperate need of some positive energy following back-to-back losses against Wales and France, but de Villiers insisted that it would be foolish to make wholesale changes for the trip to Rome.  “It is a very dficult place to play – a very passionate place in terms of energy and people getting behind their team,” he reasoned.  “Italy see Scotland as a team they want to take a scalp from and we know that.  It has been very physical in the past in Rome.  “Italy might not always get the results, but they have a very physical team, so we need to take that battle on and get off to a good start.”  “We would obviously like to do better than in the past two games,” he added. “There were some disappointments there but there were some good lessons and growth opportunities. “We would like to be more balanced in our approach in terms of applying pressure and maintaining pressure.  “Finishing off opportunities is something that France did very well, and we did not do as well. “I think we are a better team than the results have shown in our games so far and we would like to prove it out on the pitch. We would have liked to start off better, but those things happen. It is a growth experience for us and an opportunity for us to grow as a team. It is very important for us to finish these last two games well.” "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Like countless others watching the invasion unfold on the news, from a position of safety, we are deeply moved and appeal for your urgency in introducing sanctions on Russian activity in the UK.#We appeal to you to take immediate action to address the activity of state-owned Russian vessels in UK waters at this time, in particular the activities by Sovcomflot oil tankers in the Northern Isles of Scotland. We are aware of the vessel NS Challenger, owned by Sovcomflot, which was permitted to take on cargo at Sullom Voe Oil terminal, in Shetland on the February .#Following the media statements from Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP, another Sovcomflot vessel NS Champion has cancelled its berth in Scapa Flow, Orkney on the March , .#It is with our disappointment that sanctions were not imposed prior to this Sovcomflot activity in Shetland, however we hope that similar commercial activity in our waters is restricted in future.#We, the undersigned, fully support the UK Government extending sanctions to mody the obligations of Open Port Duty, Section  of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act , to be applied to the activity of Russian state-owned vessels and their use of UK ports.#Elected members of Orkney Islands Council, as the Orkney Harbour Authority, continue to uphold the Port Marine Safety Code and the obligations covered by the Pilotage Act .#The letter was signed by all  councillors. The amendment to UK sanctions came into force at pm this Tuesday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So we’ll sit down and go through what we’re going to come up against,” the England batter said.“Look at their bowling, look at their batting as well and just go out there like we did the other day, nice and calm, everyone knows their role and just go out there and have fun and seewe can get those two points.”"},{"url":null,"title":"papers-say---march-8   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Rather than lessening exposure to the harsh winds that whip around the pitch though, these new saplings have been planted with a view to offsetting the carbon footprint of the side’s first XV on their travels.Playing in Kukri Championship One, the County Down side rack up their fair share of miles with trips to the likes of Enniskillen and Clogher Valley on the fixture list and it was such y journeys that got clubman Peter Dickson thinking about the side’s impact on the environment.“I work for Bridgestone, who have a good relationship with rugby through their advertising at Ravenhill and things like that,” he says. “And they’ve been involved with Dromore for quite a while too.“At Bridgestone, we’re a company that is very into sustainability and we invest heavily in that. Working in the corporate world really gave me an insight into how important it is for companies to take their responsibilities seriously and the idea that every organisation has to do its part.“So I was sitting in a Starbucks one day thinking about how Dromore Rugby Club could do its own part and develop a sustainability programme. What would be realistic for us to do  And thinking about it, as a club where we generate most of our carbon footprint is from our travel. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I got Google Maps out, clocked up all our miles, looked at things like the average Co emission per vehicle, the number of people we take to games and things like that. “And it worked out that we had a total of  miles in the league, which meant that it seemed to be that throughout the season we’d have emissions of about six tonnes. It takes six trees to offset one tonne so we were looking at  trees to come out neutral and we rounded that up to .“I went to Bridgestone who gave us a bit of money, and the Old Mill Nursery in Dromore gave us the trees, and from there this idea born in a coffee shop got to where we are now.“We put some of the trees in our grounds, because it all starts at the club, but whether it was farmers, guys who were building houses, whatever, it was so, so easy to get rid of the rest.“You’d don’t struggle to give things away in Dromore, that’s something learned.”While they’ll look to repeat the initiative year after year to offset each season’s travel, this is only a small part of the club’s plans. They have already installed LED floodlights with a view to cutting down on their electricity usage, a move which has cost-saving benefits as well as environmental ones, and their next project later this year will look at the carbon footprint of their clubhouse with the possibility of new heating systems being explored. “If you were building a clubhouse  years ago, sustainability wasn’t something that you would have considered,” adds Dickson. “But today,you’re not considering sustainability you’re not being responsible.”As the club sees it, that responsibility extends not just to crunching the numbers, but in educating their members too.“The mini-rugby club has got involved and they’ve embraced it,” Dickson says. “It’s been great to get them out with a shovel planting trees.“It shows them what they need to do. When they’re grown up, in  years, they’ll have a responsibility too to look after the next generation.“There’s kids in the community that look to Dromore Rugby Club and see us as leaders and it’s important for us to take on that responsibility and show the way.“We’re an amateur sports club, and obviously we want to go out and win on a Saturday, but there’s nothing more important to a club like ourselves than the people and the community. “Projects like these are a big part of that.”Related topicsClimate ChangeMore On Climate Change PremiumFriends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Ask the expert: ‘We need all of us to understand that this really is an emergency’ PremiumClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsThe -year-old nun that’s standing with our youth to help fight climate changeRosalind SkillenOpinionHow green is your candidate  Why it’s so vital to quiz politicians when they ask for your voteMost ReadThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsTerried Belfast gran flees home after third attack by masked gangIRA man Anthony Doherty, linked to deaths of three Scottish soldiers, dies in Dublin hospital‘We just want them to come over here quickly and safely’… NI man’s petition urges UK to waive visa restrictions for Ukrainian refugeesNorthern Ireland cop John Fleming facing jail over cruelty to pet dogs caught on dashcamTop VideosPlayMan arrested after lorry crashes into gates of Russian embassy in DublinPlayUkraine war: Little girl sings #Let It Go# from Disney#s Frozen while sheltering in Kyiv bunkerPlayVideo: Russian Army choir #abducted# while singing  Spectre theme songLatest EnvironmentFriends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Ask the expert: ‘We need all of us to understand that this really is an emergency’Climate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsThe -year-old nun that’s standing with our youth to help fight climate changeRosalind SkillenOpinionHow green is your candidate  Why it’s so vital to quiz politicians when they ask for your voteLatestWhat the papers say – March Graphic NYT front page illustrates reality of the war, newspaper saysStar trek and Girls!

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueGreen Party NI leader Clare Bailey pictured.March   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPoliticians are increasing recognising that immediate and decisive action on the climate crisis will not only influence votes — it will win votes.Indeed, for many Northern Irish voters, climate action will be one of the defining issues in the upcoming MLA elections in May.With these elections fast approaching, many candidates have already started leafleting and door-knocking. However, when a candidate knocks at your door, what questions should you ask them  More importantly, how do you know whether they are genuinely serious about what they propose To gain a deeper sense of the candidate’s knowledge and understanding of climate breakdown, begin the conversation in the context of the broader political landscape.There are currently two climate bills passing through the Northern Irish Assembly. These are subject to ongoing debates, reviews and amendments. Both bills have a target of net zero emissions. Yet while the Private Members’ Billaims for Northern Ireland to be net zero by , the Executive Billaims for .Read MoreClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsYou could therefore start by asking the following question: which bill do they support Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Given how both bills aim for Northern Ireland to be net zero, despite ying target dates, a good follow-up question would be to ask how their party hopes to achieve this. How will they get us there  What is their political strategy  What concrete steps will they take to help Northern Ireland reach net zero Northern Ireland is not only the last nation in western Europe to implement climate legislation, but we also rank th worst in the world for bioersity loss. Nature recovery is therefore integral to an ambitious climate strategy.It is therefore crucial to ask the candidate about how they plan to halt and reverse nature and bioersity loss. How will they promote regenerative agricultural practices  How will they create more spaces for nature  How will they prevent the decline — and potential extinction — of our valuable species and wildle There are also three sectors in Northern Ireland which could be uniquely affected by the climate crisis: agriculture, energy and transport. These three sectors are vastly dferent. However, what unies questions regarding the future of these sectors is the principle of ‘just transition’.‘Just transition’ is the idea that we should not moveto a low-carbon, environmentally-friendly economyit means sacricing justice or ‘fairness’. A just transition recognises that, whether it be people on low incomes or workers in the fossil fuel industry, no one should be left behind in the creation of a ‘greener’ society.To take energy as an example, fossil fuels like oil and gas remain the primary source of heat and power in Northern Ireland. We already know that fossil fuels are harmful to the environment, and they will not help us to reach climate targets. Beyond asking candidate about renewable energy systems, we must therefore go one step further.We need to ask candidates about how they will compensate for workers in polluting industries, who may find themselves without a job in a more sustainable world. What incentive schemes will they promote  How will they re-train or upskill iniduals  How will government invest in this The same is true for agricultural and transport sectors. Will there be grants or public goods for farmers who dedicate areas of land to rewilding or regenerative practices  Will there be further investment in public transport infrastructure, particularly in rural communities  How will government incentivise citizens to support ‘greener’ lestyle choices that are typically more expensive, like buying an electric car or fitting solar  at home Lastly, ask the candidate seeking your vote about what is important to you.Whether it be plastic pollution or food waste, this is an invaluable opportunity for you to ask the candidate about a specic topic that you care deeply about. This could be an ongoing problem in your local area, or a global issue which causes you concern.Raising more personal questions with candidates may subsequently elicit a more direct response from them.Elections are a rare opportunity for citizens to shape environmental policy, and focus political attention on the most defining issue of our generation: the climate crisis.Climate change will be related to every social issue on each political party’s manesto – from gender equality to healthcare.Voting for candidates who support ambitious environmental policy solutions is therefore arguably the most important action that citizens can take.Remember this when candidates come calling.Related topicsEdwin PootsClare BaileyClimate ChangeClimate BillMore On Edwin Poots PremiumFriends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Greens call for independent environmental agency in NI after Poots announces English office to extend its remit to Northern Ireland PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionConservative farmer Edwin Poots parachutes into liberal south BelfastEdwin Poots confirmed to replace Christopher Stalford for south Belfast seat PremiumClimate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsMost ReadThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsTerried Belfast gran flees home after third attack by masked gangIRA man Anthony Doherty, linked to deaths of three Scottish soldiers, dies in Dublin hospital‘We just want them to come over here quickly and safely’… NI man’s petition urges UK to waive visa restrictions for Ukrainian refugeesNorthern Ireland cop John Fleming facing jail over cruelty to pet dogs caught on dashcamTop VideosPlayMan arrested after lorry crashes into gates of Russian embassy in DublinPlayUkraine war: Little girl sings #Let It Go# from Disney#s Frozen while sheltering in Kyiv bunkerPlayVideo: Russian Army choir #abducted# while singing  Spectre theme songLatest EnvironmentFriends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Environment In Focus: Dromore Rugby Club plant trees to neutralise  miles of travelling for away gamesAsk the expert: ‘We need all of us to understand that this really is an emergency’Climate: ‘Supporting that Bill would have led to the loss of , jobs in the farming sector’ – Agriculture Minister Edwin PootsThe -year-old nun that’s standing with our youth to help fight climate changeLatestWhat the papers say – March Graphic NYT front page illustrates reality of the war, newspaper saysStar trek and Girls!

The constant monitoring of prices is one of the reasons fuel here is currently cheaper than where in the UK, which wasn’t always the case.The AA said: “Every day is a record day at the moment, but Northern Ireland still enjoys cheaper fuel than the UK mainland.”As a rule of thumb, fill up in areas where many retailers are vying for your custom. Generally speaking,there are two or more supermarket fuel retailers in close proximity, prices will be competitive.In Northern Ireland, as in the rest of the UK, there is no regulatory body when it comes to fuel pricing.Simply put, it means retailers can charge whatever they like — and there’s plenty of evidence they’re doing just that.Related topicsCost of LivingMore On Cost of Living PremiumNorthern Ireland fuel price ‘could hit £ per litre by next month’As fuel prices continue to soar above £. across Northern Ireland, what are the cheapest and most expensive prices in your area ‘UK and EU should work together to reduce energy bills’: Doug Beattie urges Brexit negotiators Truss and Sefcovic PremiumRalph HewittOpinionHow the Ukraine conflict is starting to hit home – and we are all paying for itHow you can save money on household bills as costs spiral of controlMost ReadThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsTerried Belfast gran flees home after third attack by masked gangIRA man Anthony Doherty, linked to deaths of three Scottish soldiers, dies in Dublin hospital‘We just want them to come over here quickly and safely’… NI man’s petition urges UK to waive visa restrictions for Ukrainian refugeesNorthern Ireland cop John Fleming facing jail over cruelty to pet dogs caught on dashcamTop VideosPlayMan arrested after lorry crashes into gates of Russian embassy in DublinPlayUkraine war: Little girl sings #Let It Go# from Disney#s Frozen while sheltering in Kyiv bunkerPlayVideo: Russian Army choir #abducted# while singing  Spectre theme songLatest Northern IrelandBritish man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in cabBelfast’s Black Santa set for special sit-out to raise funds for those fleeing war‘We lived in a bunker to simulate a nuclear blast...  years on, that threat has ed’Friends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Fractious exchanges during Assembly debate over draft budgetLatestWhat the papers say – March Graphic NYT front page illustrates reality of the war, newspaper saysStar trek and Girls!

Credit: Michael CooperGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA fractious debate has taken place at the NI Assembly over a three year draft budget with MLAs arguing about the absence of an Executive and a budget short on detail.On Monday evening MLAs discussed reports on the - draft budget.Chair of the Justice Committee Mervyn Storey insisted that departments other than health needed increased levels of funding citing a potential drop in policing numbers and said he would take no lectures from Sinn Fein.While SDLP MLA Matthew O’Toole said Northern Ireland has no strategy for investment as MLAs only think about their own constituencies.Opening the debate, chairman of the Finance Committee Steve Aiken said the consultation period for the draft budget had been scheduled to close on March .He said it would be the only chance in this mandate to debate the draft budget of £. billion which he described as a “signicant amount of resource”.The UUP MLA for South Antrim told the Assembly: “This bigger budget envelope would allow us to plan for change and reformDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “But with reform must come decisions and indeed consequences. To some degree the budget sets out both of these. In other respects we’re left to underscore or fill in the blanks ourselves.“The budget isn’t linked to a programme for government, it’s capital spend wasn’t shaped by an agreed investment strategy. The budget itself has not been agreed by the Executive, there isn’t an Executive, and indeed in the absence of the Executive the consultation process has been paused.“The draft budget also seems to include a kind of public sector pay promise which appears to be about % per annum, with more for the health sector.“It also appears that regional rates will also be frozen for the relevant period.”Mr Aiken mentioned those because they have “signicant consequences” for public finances.He said the impact on departments are not fully explored and there are references but little by way of substantial detail on “big ticket policy items” such as Green Growth which will be informed by new climate change legislation.The UUP MLA added that “hard decisions” will be required in respect of the health sector.More detail is needed, he said, before the Assembly can sign off on the draft budget “with any degree of confidence”.DUP MLA Mervyn Storey was critical of the draft budget which he said would leave justice as the only department whose funding would be reduced over the three year period.He said other parties are keen to remind his own how they have put the party before the electorate.They have “short memories”, Mr Storey said, and forget that between - it “suited their own political agenda” to collapse Stormont.Referring to Tory austerity, he added: “I remember sitting in a room with the Ministernot far from this building where he was unprepared to put through the regulations for welfare reform and now all of a sudden they’ve become champions of welfare reform.“But who put the regulations through for welfare reform, the big bad Tories, but of course it was always then. They took the heavy lting and the Sinn Fein party takes the credit. Now is there anything new in that.“So I have to say when it comes to finances, when it comes to the fiscal council, when it comes to dealing with the budget for Northern Ireland, I don’t think we need to take lectures from a party who supported the bombing of the heart of Northern Ireland for  years and destroyed the economy of Northern Ireland.”SDLP MLA Matthew O’Toole questioned how the draft budget is debated in NI.He said MLAs stand up and argue that a community or “X, Y and Z” should be funded in their own constituency.The South Belfast MLA said there is a “fundamental problem” in that Northern Ireland has no overarching strategy for investment, an issue that was flagged by the fiscal council - an independent body created to bring greater transparency and scrutiny to NI’s public finances.“What we need to do when scrutinising the Executive’s budget is to have a proper sense of what the strategy is. In the absence of a programme for government, the default strategy making document is the budget,” Mr O’Toole added.The transition to a new low carbon economy will define this century, he said, and the multi year budget should have plans in place.Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the draft budget is a “golden opportunity” to reform public services.“Health should be benefiting from a % uplt in its budget with cancer, mental health and waiting list strategies funded in full. And all other departments should be receiving a budget increase.“All that has been denied by the DUP’s decision to collapse the Executive in protest at the protocol.”Any budget must be agreed by an Executive, Mr Murphy said, adding that the DUP should appoint a First Minister and agree a budget.The Finance Minister said the key question is whether to prioritise health and that will mean other departments will not get the allocation they would like.Rounding up, Steve Aiken said some form of Executive government must be re-established becauseonly % of the budget can be spent by July and then special measures are required to get to % by the end of the year it will have “very real implications” on services here.“On our policing numbers, on our nurses, on our teachers and on our economy,” he concluded.Most ReadThe cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsTerried Belfast gran flees home after third attack by masked gangIRA man Anthony Doherty, linked to deaths of three Scottish soldiers, dies in Dublin hospital‘We just want them to come over here quickly and safely’… NI man’s petition urges UK to waive visa restrictions for Ukrainian refugeesNorthern Ireland cop John Fleming facing jail over cruelty to pet dogs caught on dashcamTop VideosPlayMan arrested after lorry crashes into gates of Russian embassy in DublinPlayUkraine war: Little girl sings #Let It Go# from Disney#s Frozen while sheltering in Kyiv bunkerPlayVideo: Russian Army choir #abducted# while singing  Spectre theme songLatest Northern IrelandBritish man transports  vulnerable Ukrainians across Polish border in cabBelfast’s Black Santa set for special sit-out to raise funds for those fleeing war‘We lived in a bunker to simulate a nuclear blast...  years on, that threat has ed’Friends of the Earth: ‘Stormont’s one of the main reasons we’re so close to becoming the dirty corner of Europe’Greens call for independent environmental agency in NI after Poots announces English office to extend its remit to Northern IrelandLatestDolly Parton dedicates th ACM awards to the people of UkraineWhat the papers say – March Graphic NYT front page illustrates reality of the war, newspaper saysStar trek and Girls!

He has previously labelled the proposals to move the four wards as ldquototally unacceptable.Mr McGrath contends there is no historical, cultural, economic or educational link between Downpatrick and Comber or Newtownards, areas currently in the Strangford constituency that would be in the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency.He said other political parties have made their stance clear via their respective submissions to the Commission, but was left ldquoaghast with Sinn Feinrsquos response which indicated that it was content with a number of areas including Malone Heights, Roughal Park, the Strangford Road, Ardenlee and Saul Acres developments and all of Saul and Strangford being removed from South Down to form part of the suggested new constituency.ldquoThe net result would be residents on either side of the Saul Road voting in dferent constituencies and I cannot comprehend the rationale for this, said Mr McGrath.The MLA said when he makes his presentation today, he will make it clear to the Commission ldquoin no uncertain terms that the proposal to move the four Downpatrick wards and much of Crossgar, Annacloy and Teconnaught into the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency is ldquounacceptable.He added: ldquoLet us retain our links with places like Castlewellan, Newcastle and the wider South Down area and do not use Downpatrick as a scapegoat for their attempts to address wider electoral issues in Belfast or other parts of the North..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"150th anniversary of Downpatrick church  ","story":"THE Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh is to speak in Downpatrick to mark the th anniversary of St Patrickrsquos Church in the town.Archbishop Eamon Martin will celebrate mass on March th as part of a special St Patrickrsquos Novena mdash nine days of prayer mdash in the church where generations of Catholics have worshipped since .Poor Clares Sr Martina Purdy and Sr Elaine Kelly mdash who pioneered St Patrickrsquos Camino walk in Downpatrick two years ago mdash will help launch the Novena at the invitation of parish priest Fr John Murray.On March , Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, a former BBC correspondent and a former barrister respectively, will share their faith story, entitled lsquoOur Friend Patrickrsquo.The Dean of Down, the Very Henry Hull is also to take part in an ecumenical celebration on March  while the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Most Rev Noel Treanor, will celebrate Sunday mass on March .Fr John Murray, PP, said the St Patrickrsquos celebration would remember all the thousands of people who have attended mass and celebrated the sacraments in the church in St Patrickrsquos Avenue since its foundation.ldquoIt is an occasion to give thanks for those countless lives of witness and faith and to look forward to the future with confidence and hope in Christ, he said.ldquoIn , Fr Patrick OrsquoKane and the parishioners of St Patrickrsquos could not have imagined the events of two world wars and the rise and fall of Communism, the Second Vatican Council and the many other huge milestones that have come to dominate the landscape that is the th century.ldquoThey could not have imagined that  years after the church was built that we are just emerging from a pandemic.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands.

Aontuacute says Rosemary also opposes the de-prioritisation funding of hundreds of local schools that is contained in the Integrated Education Bill.Her party leader, Peader Toacuteibiacuten, said , people are on housing waiting lists, , on hospital waiting lists for longer than a year, a quarter of a million people are in poverty and Sinn Fein and SDLP MLAs have voted for abortion right up until the birth of the child.He declared: ldquoThat the DUP has torn down Stormont in the middle of these very real human crisis is wrong and it must not be allowed to happen again.ldquoAontuacute is the only political party calling for the reform of the democratic institutions to prevent any one party tearing them down again or any one party preventing an Executive being formed in the future.ldquoThese le and death issues are too important for Stormont to be crashed over and over again. We are also calling for the suspension of MLA salaries for the political parties who crash the democratic institutions or prevent Executives being formed.Mr Aontuacute described Ms McGlone as a le-long human rights activist and nationalist who stopped voting for the SDLP because ldquoit abandoned her and so many communities to pursue identity politics.He continued: ldquoRosemary will lead the fight to give a voice to the tens of thousands of people who currently have no representation in Co Down. Stormont is broken and she will help lead the fight by Aontuacute to make the democratic institutions work.ldquoRosemary will also stand strong for the human right to le for everyone. She fully supports the integrated education sector but will fight for equality and parity of esteem in the education system, especially for rural schools and will oppose the Integrated Education Bill. All students mdash Catholic, Protestant and Integrated mdash should be treated equally.

The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time. Off went Rory Mason and Adam Kearney to be replaced with Eoin Rooney and Keegan Domican.As the game settled after the restart on  minutes, Campbell blazed a half chance over when well-placed following a corner for the home side.The next attack did bring the equaliser the home outfit craved. The ball fell to the feet of Callum Dougan after a Mills attack down the right looked like coming to nothing and he despatched it to the back of the net with aplomb.

The part of the track closest to the residents will be some - metres away.But Shan Slieve Drive householders say that is too close. In their petition to planners they say that the nearest gardens to the track are just  metres away and  dwellings and two major residential homes for the elderly are within  metres of the site.ldquoThe noise generated by the use of the track is likely to be highly detrimental to residents over a wide area, they claim. ldquoSuch a track is likely to operate from Easter until the end of September at least at weekends and almost certainly daily from am until pm during July and August.

A number of owners want to leave the industry, but this will not let them get out, he added.Mr Curran said Northern Ireland fishermen were in dficulty, with some living on the breadline.Accusing the

allocation of funds and thus enrich the educational experience offered to our pupils, said Mr Hanna.ldquoWhat was not said, of course, was that the Government had tired of the antics of the teaching

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy.

The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient. Ultimately treatment is available that helps each inidual become empowered, recover and move forward with their lives.If you have any queries or would like to arrange an appointment please call   or email empower@post www.empowercounsellingni.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Top dancer Anna qualifies for World Championships  ","story":"LOCAL Irish dancers have proven themselves to be a step above the rest once again.Members of the Crossgar-based Scoil Rince an Chroiacute dance school enjoyed plenty of success at the Kelly Hendry Feis in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Mid-Ulster Grades Feis in Dungannon.Thirty-five dancers from the school took to the stage at both locations with dancers excelling in both the grades system and championships.The school ed home with  first places,  top five places and a host of trophies and sashes.The schoolrsquos success comes of the back of a very successful Ulster Championships in Ballybofey in October.Anna McGlew qualied for the World Championships to be held in Belfast at Easter and Sean Gordon achieved fth place, reaching a podium place at his first Ulsters, having only started to compete four months prior.Teacher Briacuted McKinney said: ldquoWhilst acknowledging the ious pandemic-related challenges brought to us in  and early this year, the great class spirit and support for each other helped drive our ious success both last year and this year to date.Co-teacher Maura Davidson commented: ldquoThe results are down to the commitment, dedication and support from our dancers and families.The school now prepares for their first championship feis in Downpatrick later this month and the World Championships at Easter.Classes continue weekly at the studio in Crossgar.

Their production is an echo of the old industrial output of businesses such as Harland and Wolff, which constructed some of the finest ships that ever set sail.It is encouraging to hear Mr Khan, like Mr Johnson and other visitors to Wrightbus such as the former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, talk of the bus orders in terms of a UK perspective, in which the regions and their connection to Britain’s biggest city are celebrated.It is a pity though that the shipping or automotive industries in the UK are not what they might be, given the way that more amorphous sectors such as services have become so dominant to the overall economy.It is even more of a pity that UK manufacturing of objects for use in a city where in the UK now has to navigate an obstacle to movement of goods and parts within the nation.Removing that barrier, the Northern Ireland Protocol, is essential.

The chanting of hate-filled pro-IRA propaganda by GAA supporters routinely surfaces on social media. If, as Ruth Dudley Edwards suggests, the GAA feels embarrassed by having Sinn Fein unveil a monument to IRA terrorists at one of their clubs, they keep it well hidden. Their statement that they “...will work on issuing guidance to clubs and counties on such events in the future” downplays the offence that such “events” engender within all right-minded people. However, until the GAA complete their “work” they should issue a clear unequivocal statement that anyone who supports, justies or celebrates violence inflicted in furtherance of political objectives — past, present or future — is unwelcome within the GAA. Until such a statement is made no further tax-payers money should be given to the GAA.Thomas Smyth, Belfast BTRuth Dudley Edwards: Little chance for power sharing when Sinn Fein laud IRA"},{"url":null,"title":"wearing masks in school is of no benefit to children but rather causes harm ","story":"What is NATO  What does NATO stand for, member states, is Ukraine in NATO - and why is Ireland not in NATO     motorists ‘engaged in anti-social behaviour’ in NI townNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionWearing masks in school is of no benefit to children but rather causes harmA letter from Hugh McCarthy:By LettersThursday, rd March , : amUpdated Thursday, rd March , : am  \"       \"  A school pupil’s capacity to express feelings is affected by being masked.

Picture by Philip Magowan   PressEye“The things that are pressing on people’s minds, our health service, on the cost-of-living crisis, the fact that we have to deal with climate change – these are the issues that are gripping people, not the constitutional question right now,” she told BBC NI’s ‘Sunday Politics’ show.“And when we take a position, as undoubtedly will happen at some point in the future, it will be based on facts and evidence.“We’re not going to see a referendum and we don’t want to support a referendum on Northern Ireland’s future in the context of, for example, a Brexit-style referendum where you promise everything to everybody, and everybody comes away disappointed.“So, we’ve got to actually focus on the things that matter to people and I think what we’ve got to do also is respect the fact that for many people in our community, and for a growing number, it isn’t the thing that defines their politics, and we’ve got to adapt our politics to respect that.”In her conference speech on Saturday, Mrs Long said a big result for the Alliance Party in the Assembly election in May could herald the end of Stormont political system based on binary ision.She stressed the need for major changes to structures that are currently based on the community designation system that effectively hands blocs of unionists or nationalists a veto.Yesterday, Mrs Long said Stormont could no longer one party was able to halt effective governanceit decided to “take their ball and go home”.Her comments come amid the latest power-sharing crisis at Stormont.The Executive imploded last month when the DUP withdrew first minister Paul Givan from the administration as part of its campaign of protest against Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.The move automatically ousted Sinn Fein deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill from office and removed the Executive’s ability to take any signicant decisions.Other ministers, such as Mrs Long, remain in post but are constrained in their ability to shape major policies.There remains uncertainty whether a new administration can be formed on the other side of the May  election, with the DUP making clear it cannot be business as usual until Brexit barriers on Irish Sea trade are removed.“We need to make sure that in future Assemblies and Executives that no party can take their ball and go home, and leave the rest of us in this kind of situation,” Mrs Long told BBC NI yesterday.“I think what we do need to do is rebalance the playing field. If the DUP don’t want to be part of government, they have a right to be, butthey don’t want to be that shouldn’t mean we can’t have a government, and the same should go for every other party.“If parties want to walk away from government, that’s their choice, which they should answer for, but they shouldn’t be able to hold the rest of us hostage.”Naomi LongNorthern IrelandDUPBrexitBBC  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularPSNI issue update on suspected abduction of young maleSinn Fein’s past hostility towards NATO ‘shows party was peeing into the wind, and it has come back to hit them in the face’Fermanagh GAA player’s family hit by third tragedy as father dies after being hit by lorryFallen telegraph pole blocks street in NI town Former grand master standing for electionMost PopularBest men’s wetsuits UK : great suits for surfing and open water swimmin from RipCurl, Finnisterre, ZoneBest portable solar chargers for camping UK : keep your USB devices charged while backpacking and campingCan the right mattress help with back pain  We review Simba, Nectar, Dormeo and Tempur mattressesBest walking shoes UK : the best men’s shoes for hiking and walking from Salomon, Inov-, and MerrellBest high street wedding dresses UK :  styles of beautul, cheap wedding dress for every type of bride                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported exclusively on our sister site The National on St Davids Day, the Cardf Capital Regiongroup of local authorities has bought the site of Wales last coal-fired power station for £ million. CCR says it is committing £. million to the project in total, which includes the purchase price.The other £. million will be spent on \"demolition, remediation, and re-development\".The contracts have now been exchanged between Cardf Capital Region and energy giant RWE, the seller. The distinctive Aberthaw Power Station as seen from the air. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The Cardf Capital Region have released a proposed \"master plan\" for the redevelopment of the site, which they say \"will take several years to come to fruition given the nature of and complexities involved in the transitioning process\".In sum, CCR says it will:Support the production of renewable and green energy projectsProvide an accompanying battery storage facility to support the green energy projectsProduce a zero-carbon manufacturing cluster which will include green hydrogen production facilitiesProvide a green energy innovation centre to promote innovation, growth, knowledge and community interaction with the zero-carbon future of WalesBe responsible for the development and maintenance of a bio-erse ecology park which will include a visitor centre, providing amenities to the local communityCreate the correct conditions to support industrial de-carbonisation and future giga-plant facilities.Cardf Capital Region also says the project has \"the potential to create thousands of direct, indirect and induced jobs, along with local supply chain and upskilling benefits\", though no further details were supplied as to what that means in practical terms. An artists impression of the Aberthaw Power Station site created by London real estate giant, Reef Group for Cardf Capital Region The master plan of the site produced by London real estate giant Reef Group on behalf of Cardf Capital Region The CCR goes on to say that it will \"maintain a strong commitment to engage and involve local community stakeholders in order to develop an open, inclusive and participative ethos as soon as the commercially sensitive considerations have been addressed.\"There are areas of the site which require ongoing custodianship, in respect of nature, bioersity and managing the overall ecology of the site, which will be best achieved in partnership with community.\"The Aberthaw nature reserve. The lagoon is where the ancient Aberthaw harbour was situated before it was destroyed to make way for the power station. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The group also says that its redevelopment plan will \"commit to safeguarding and developing the Nature Reserve, working with colleagues in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to ensure effective plans are put in place. In the interim, whilst plans are worked through, commitment is given to ensure this ecologically valuable component of the site is protected and, wherever possible, further enhanced and augmented\".However, Cardf Capital Region, despite promising to work with local residents in the future, stops short of making specic reference to concerns raised by members of the nearby community recently. Those concerns centre around what will happen to the  metre high pulverised ash mound, the sea wall being breached by the tide, and problems with traffic due to poor local transport infrastructure. The long Aberthaw Power Station ash mound, m high. The smoke stack can be seen in the background. Photo: Siriol Grfiths \"Well believe these plans when we see them,\" Paul Turner told The National. He has been living in the shadow of the power station since  and says that since then, he and his we Sara have seen many ideas come and go, including nuclear power and tidal energy. \"Everybody who lives near that site knows how toxic it is. The ash tip is full of asbestos from when they demolished the original A power station. And the site gets flooded whenever theres a spring tide or a storm, ask anyone who has worked there. Thatll only get worse as the years go by.\"Will £ million keep the tide from drowning that site  Id say RWE are laughing all the way to the bank.\"The Climate Central Coastal Risk Screening Tool predicts that the site will be under water by , with flooding reaching as far inland as St Hilarys There are similar concerns from Barry Town Councillor, Dennis Clarke: \"The ambition for the Vale to access clean, green, high value employment is commendable but this site could not be sold to private industry. The likely reason the site was regarded as unsaleable might be the cost of dealing with tidal flooding, clearing the signicant level of contamination, removing the slag heap, identied as dangerous by RWE.\"Its well known that the road access is completely insufficient, especially bearing in mind the Vale and the Welsh Government persist in supporting a too large, unviable development at Model Farm\"I hope the CCR releases the papers that will show why they believe this site is suitable for any development beyond reinstating what was in place before the power station was built.\"A map produced by London real estate giant Reef Group in  depicting so-called major assets nearbyIn its statement, the CCR describes the Aberthaw site as having \"strong strategic links with other major assets, including Bro Tathan Business Park, Cardf Airport, and the overarching St Athan Enterprise Zone – one of the few sites in the UK capable of accommodating large-scale lithium-ion battery production\".Last month, the Welsh Government was accused of having let a proposed gigafactory project at St Athan \"slip throughfingers\" by Welsh Conservative South Wales Central MS Andrew RT Davies. It followed an announcement by car battery manufacturer, Britishvolt, that it was creating a factory in Northumberland, whereas St Athan had been its original preferred location. March  : Aberthaw Power Station as photographed from the Wales Coast Path. The site is currently badly flooded in the wake of recent storms and spring tides. Photo: Siriol Grfiths CCRs plans make no specic reference to tidal energy at Aberthaw either, despite the group having earmarked the site as being \"perfect for that type of facility\" last summer. By October , it was also reported that a new commission was being set up to explore building a barrage across the Severn estuary for tidal energy CCR is a part of that commission. However, a statement supplied by Welsh Government Economy Minister, Vaughan Gething, does moot the possibility of tidal energy: \"The proposed plan for Aberthaw is positive news which fits well with our commitment to develop tidal lagoon projects and support ideas that can help Wales become a world centre for emerging tidal technologies\".Mr Gethings enthusiasm is echoed by the UK governments Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, David TC Davies, who is the Conservative MP for Monmouth: \"The UK Government’s investment in the Cardf Capital Region will deliver thousands of jobs at Aberthaw and help put Wales on course for an economic recovery from the pandemic.\"The current s of the Cardf Capital Region - including any activity at Aberthaw - will eventually move into the new South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee .Three other Corporate Joint Committees will cover the rest of Wales in the south-west, the north, and the central area of the country.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I can’t wait to hear what the children think of it.“This new school building will provide a modern teaching and learning environment for staff and pupils, as well as a range of facilities for the local community.”The design includes solar  with battery storage, an air source heat pump, electric vehicle charging points, storage space for bicycles and scooters, and green habitat areas.Contractors ISG began building the school in January last year, which forms part of the council’s wider £ million programme of new school buildings across the Vale.Cllr Burnett added: “The council has made a climate commitment through our Project Zero initiative, which aims to make the organisation carbon neutral by . Delivering schools like this, which are extremely environmentally friendly, is a key part of that pledge.“This is the latest project in our Sustainable Communities for Learning programme, a far-reaching body of work intended to transform educational facilities across the Vale.”Protests were sparked by the decision to relocate Llancarfan Primary School from its village setting five miles down the road to Rhoose, with some parents opposing what they saw as the closure of a rural school. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This will include a regular annual vacination programme, the Welsh Government has said.: Three Covid deaths reported in Wales - more than  new cases in Gwent.It comes as Mr Drakeford has said that Wales will remain at alert level zero for the next three weeks, with no further changes to Covid regulations planned before March .Then, all legal measures could be removed, should the public health situation remain stable, the first minister said.“We’ve been living in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic for two long years,” he said. “It has touched all our lives – across Wales, families and communities have made many sacrices to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. People in Wales have followed the rules.“But sadly, too many families have experienced the pain of losing a loved one or a close friend. My thoughts are with them all.“As we publish this longer-term plan, there is no doubt we have reached a signicant moment in this pandemic and we can look to the future with growing confidence that the next year will be one in which we have a dferent relationship with the virus.“This has been made possible by the hard work of everyone and by the efforts of all the health and care staff, public sector workers and volunteers who have done so much over the last two years..remove“But the pandemic isn’t over – this virus is full of nasty surprises and we are likely to see fluctuations in global patterns of infection for several years.“We need to be ready to respond quickly to any future outbreaks or new iants as we learn to live safely alongside coronavirus in the long-term.“We have learned so much over the last two years and we need to harness this as we look forward to a safer and brighter future together.”Together for a Safer Future: Wales’ Long-term Covid- Transition from Pandemic to Endemic will set out a gradual transition away from emergency measures using two core scenarios – Covid Stable and Covid Urgent.Covid Stable – the most likely scenario – is where Wales may encounter new waves of infection, but they are not expected to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS, due to the effectiveness of vaccines and other treatments, such as new Covid- antivirals.The Welsh Government has said this will include vaccination boosters in the spring for  the elderly and most vulnerable adults, and a regular autumn vaccination programme. The Test, Trace, Protect proramme will also move to a more targeted approach aimed at vulnerable people.Planning is also under way for a Covid-Urgent scenario, to allow for the Welsh Government and other public services to quickly respond to situations such as a new iant which evades the vaccine.The next review of restrictions will be carried out by March . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFlammable cladding was found on Lydstep Flats in Llandaff North in March , following concerns about fire safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire.Cardf council removed the cladding in December later that year, leaving residents suffering from cold flats, poor insulation and black mould.Now contractors ISG have started to replace that cladding, with the work expected to last until summer next year.Councillor Lynda Thorne, cabinet member for housing and communities, said: “I’m so glad, as I know all the Lydstep residents are, that contractors are now on site to begin replacing the cladding that was removed because it didn’t meet current fire safety standards.“The cladding we’re using to overclad the three blocks is of the highest level of fire safety.”The work includes new windows and upgrading balconies for the  flats. Meanwhile, residents in council flats in Butetown are still waiting for contractors to begin installing replacement cladding, with no start date announced yet.Flats at Loudon House and Nelson House in Butetown were also found to have flammable cladding in the wake of the Grenfell fire.Delays to both the council flats in Llandaff North and Butetown were due to inflation caused by Brexit and the pandemic, according to the council, as well as changes to the safety testing rules for new cladding. The estimated cost of replacing cladding at Lydstep doubled from £. million to £ million.Cllr Thorne added: “Progress on this work has been affected by signicant cost rises due to Brexit and inflationary pressures in the building industry, as well as the impact of the extensive testing and regulation framework for cladding solutions.“Throughout this time, we have been so grateful to the residents for their patience as we worked on finding the right solution for the three blocks, and it’s great to see contractors on site and work underway.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe app would let users know real-time data on public transport and the road network, and the estimated time to get somewhere by car, train, bus or bike.A huge upgrade in traffic monitoring, new bus lanes, and a state-of-the-art new traffic control room also form part of Cardf council’s plans for an ‘intelligent transport system’.Buses could also be ordered like taxis, taking a route based on the demand for the service determined by public requests.The council will consult the public on its plans to roll out the changes for the system, which it hopes will encourage people to walk, cycle or take public transport.Cllr Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: “We want to ask the public their views on our draft strategy to build an intelligent transport system in Cardf. We do have systems in place already, but they are not integrated, and many are coming to the end of their le, as they have been superseded by newer technology.“We want to reduce harmful emissions, improve air quality and make Cardf a healthier city to live and work in. One of the best ways to do that is to change the way we move around the city, encouraging public transport, cycling and walking as preferred ways of getting around.“By , we would like to see % of all journeys made by sustainable forms of transport. To do that we will need to double the number of people travelling by bike or by bus. To achieve this, we need better infrastructure which is managed by an integrated, intelligent transport system.“It would act as the nerve centre ensuring bus corridors, cycleways and improved pedestrian crossings and pavements are recognised as a key part of the network, and helping to make travel on Cardf’s roads as efficient as possible.”One goal in the new policy is integrated ticketing, which would see people taking public transport be able to use the same ticket for a train and a bus, similar to in London..removeA new traffic control centre would be built for council staff, emergency services, bus and train companies, and enforcement officers. The new control centre would help monitor traffic across the city, respond to incidents quicker, reducing congestion.The A will pilot a ‘smart corridor’ scheme with buses given priority over cars. If successful, these could be rolled out on other main roads in Cardf.A public consultation on the intelligent transport system is expected to take place in summer, before getting signed off by the cabinet in autumn.Cllr Wild added: “Through the development of the transport user app, integrated ticketing and smart technology, residents and commuters will be better informed, so they themselves can make informed decisions on the best way to travel on any given day at any given time.“Our draft strategy looks at the use of data and technology to reduce congestion, incentivise active travel to make our highway network more efficient, and will help deal with incidents on the highway more effectively.“The opening of the bus station in  will act as a trigger point to implement new services and technology, so it is important that we do this work now.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There will be two intakes with four mentees in each programme.Four entrepreneurial sisters, Tanya McGeehan, Lisa Duffy, Roisin Deery and Aisling Bremner have teamed up to launch a female mentorship programme in memory of their late father who passed away ten years ago.Tanya McGeehan said: “Daddy always raised us to believe our aspirations were valid and worth striving for. Our parents were always a positive force in our lives with the vision to see that ambition and risk were something to be championed. Not everyone has someone with this mindset supporting them, which is why we are launching The Patsy Duffy Mentorship Programme in our late father’s memory. My sisters and I want to use our years of business experience to offer advice and guidance to women who have aspirations in their professional le but who have barriers to opportunity. We want to help make a dference and be the champions and challengers in their corners like our dad was for us.”Aisling Bremner added: “The programme is open to all females who have a professional aspiration but have a barrier stopping them from realising it – this could be social responsibilities, health and wellbeing, confidence or economic. For example, ambitious employees that are stuck in a rut, entrepreneurs at the start of their journeys and lacking confidence, graduates who need guidance or stay at home mums who need the encouragement toto work. What’s more, it has been well documented that Covid- has disproportionately affected women and we therefore hope that the Patsy Duffy Mentorship Programme will play a role in helping women reach their full potential and become the best that they can!”For further information or to apply before Sunday March , go to www.patsyduffymentorshipRead More Read MoreLocals in Sound of MusicNorthern Ireland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularJudge hits out at ‘drting’ after court told of Lexus drive...NewsMan stole £, worth of alcohol including champagne...NewsBikes worth more than £, stolen in Moneymore burglary...NewsWitness appeal after car damaged near doctor’s surgery in Lu...NewsMissing Greenisland man found...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statementcanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
