Outside of London, the Scottish town of Galashiels is joined by Bradford, Perth, Cambridge and Luton as areas with the lowest drink and drug driving offences.Wayne Rooney\u0027s world of woes: He took £300,000-a-week to...Unlicensed driver is \u0027caught drink driving TWICE on the same...Share this articleWhen it comes to gender, the data reveals that men, 1.34, are more than twice as likely to drink and drug drive as women, 0.66, while the total number of convictions for women has halved over the last year (1.20 to 0.66). The analysis looked at over six million car insurance quotes run on MoneySuperMarket over 12 months - from 1 November  2017 to 31 October 2018.   Hereford emerged with the greatest number of drink and drug driving convictions at 2.30 for every 1,000 drivers - with Crewe coming in a close second with 1.86 In terms of occupation, plumbers are most likely to get behind the wheel while under the influence, an increase of 17.26 per 1,000 since 20174. Students still remain in the top two, though numbers have decreased considerably since last year, from 28.48 to 5.93 per 1,000.Scaffolders, ground workers and builder labourers are also amongst the top five with a greater likelihood of drink or drug driving.Despite this, the data from MoneySuperMarket reveals that the overall drink and drug driving rate has decreased by 29 per cent since last year, from 1.47 to 1.05 per 1,0005– though this trend doesn\u0027t apply to 17-24-year olds, for whom rates have risen by 10 per cent.Blackpool, 1.68, came in third while Sunderland, which last year took the top spot, has dropped to fourth place with a rate of 1.62 convictions per 1,000 peopleToyota, Fiat and Porsche owners have significantly reduced their drink and drug driving conviction rates in the last 12 months, nearly halving the number of offences from 1.18 to 0.56 (Toyota), 1.95 to 0.99 (Fiat) and 0.82 to 0.47 (Porsche).Emma Garland, data scientist at MoneySuperMarket, said: \u0027With Christmas parties and festivities coming up, there is more chance of people getting behind the wheel under the influence as they may not realise how much alcohol they\u0027ve had. \u0027Driving the next morning while unknowingly still over the limit is also a key factor, especially for those who may have particularly early starting times, such as labourers and plumbers. However, it\u0027s reassuring to see that convictions have decreased since last year and hopefully they will continue to do so year on year.\u0027Drink or drug driving can be damaging not only to your licence, but also to yourself and others - so if you are doubting your sobriety, don\u0027t put yourself or others at risk by driving, even if it seems like an inconvenience at the time.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Formula One Racing Champ Lewis Hamilton snaps Manhattan penthouse","story":"    Lewis Hamilton splashed out $40 million for the stunning penthouse in this limestone

Overall the public is still against her deal by 41 points to 34, although the gap has more than halved.

Mr Grayling is one of Mrs May\u0027s (pictured) closest Cabinet allies. He has warned that He said they will rue the day if they join forces with pro-Remain Conservatives and kill off the Prime Minister\u0027s deal in Tuesday\u0027s crunch Commons vote. He told the Mail: \u0027People have to think long and hard about how they are going to vote. This is too important for political game-playing and I urge Conservative MPs who back Brexit and others to back the deal.\u0027If not, we risk a break with the British tradition of moderate, mainstream politics that goes back to the Restoration in 1660.\u0027MPs need to remember that Britain, its people and its traditions are the mother of Parliaments. We ignore that and the will of the people at our peril.\u0027Nearly 200,000 people died in the English Civil War, which resulted in a short-lived republic followed by the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Mr Grayling\u0027s remarks came amid reports that Mrs May could lose next week\u0027s vote by up to 200 votes.But the Transport Secretary, who has known the Prime Minister for more than 20 years and led her successful Tory leadership campaign in 2016, praised her \u0027Churchillian\u0027 resilience.He said: \u0027Many people in history eventually succeeded just by keeping going, not giving up. \u0027Keep buggering on,\u0027 as Churchill said. The public can see she is determined and passionate and doing her best for the country.\u0027      The number of Conservative supporters who want MPs (Theresa May is pictured) to back her deal has risen to 55 per cent – up eight points in five weeksBut the Survation poll is further evidence of the huge task Mrs May faces in rescuing her deal, which seems set for defeat in the Commons on Tuesday. Overall, it is still opposed by 41 per cent to 34 per cent of the public, although opposition has fallen by nine points since December.Worryingly for Mrs May, Labour has also taken a three-point lead over the Tories with the Conservatives on 38 to Labour\u0027s 41.But the poll – which questioned 1,013 adults on Thursday and yesterday – shows that despite lacking enthusiasm for the Prime Minister\u0027s deal, voters appear to prefer it to the prospect of leaving the EU with no deal at all. Given a straight choice between Mrs May\u0027s offer or \u0027no deal\u0027, 41 per cent support her deal, compared to 32 per cent who back \u0027no deal\u0027. Tory voters\u0027 support for the Prime Minister contrasts with other recent surveys, which have shown Conservative Party members oppose her deal.          The Survation poll is further evidence of the huge task Mrs May faces in rescuing her dealEven if her deal is thrown out by MPs next week, voters want her to produce an alternative \u0027Plan B\u0027 instead of leaving the EU without any agreement with Brussels, the poll found. A total of 44 per cent favour a \u0027Plan B\u0027 – seen by most as likely to offer a \u0027softer\u0027 Brexit – with 32 per cent in favour of \u0027no deal\u0027.Mrs May was furious when rebel Conservative MPs defeated her in the Commons this week, joining forces with Labour to force her to produce a \u0027Plan B\u0027 in just three days if she loses on Tuesday. But the public backs the rebellion by 42 per cent to 35 per cent – and they also support Speaker John Bercow\u0027s decision to allow it.The survey offers other crumbs of comfort for Mrs May. Asked who they trust to handle Brexit, 34 per cent chose the Prime Minister, with 21 per cent for Mr Corbyn.She defeats Boris Johnson on the question of who is \u0027best to handle Brexit\u0027 by a margin of 34 per cent to 20 per cent. In another blow to Brexit hardliners like Mr Johnson who advocate \u0027no deal\u0027, when voters were asked to choose between that and staying in the EU, \u0027Remain\u0027 won by 46 to 41 per cent.The survey also provides fresh evidence of the deeply-conflicted views that Brexit has provoked in the public. A total of 45 per cent say Mrs May should resign if she is defeated, with 39 per cent in favour of her staying on.But Tory voters have not given up on her. An overwhelming 66 per cent say she should carry on in No 10 if she loses on Tuesday, with only 26 per cent in favour of her stepping down.A total of 26 per cent of the public say she is \u0027bad\u0027 for EU negotiations, with just 21 per cent stating she is \u0027good\u0027. But far more, 37 per cent, say whether she stays or goes will make little difference to Brexit.                                                      Brexit \u0027may not even happen\u0027: Biggest Leave donors give up on Brexit ever happening as Jeremy Hunt fears \u0027paralysis\u0027 if deal is rejected Two of the biggest donors to the Leave campaign say they have given up on Brexit ever happening.Billionaire Peter Hargreaves and veteran hedge fund manager Crispin Odey do not believe Britain will end up leaving the European Union amid the deadlock in Parliament.It came as Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned yesterday that it is more likely than ever that MPs will work to block the UK leaving without a deal.Billionaire Peter Hargreaves and veteran hedge fund manager Crispin Odey do not believe Britain will end up leaving the European Union amid the deadlock in Parliament          Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned yesterday that it is more likely than ever that MPs will work to block the UK leaving without a deal    Amber Rudd (pictured) yesterday declined three times to say she would stay in the Cabinet if Theresa May opts for a no-deal BrexitMiss Rudd said it was \u0027right\u0027 for the Government to make preparations for no-deal, but did not think the outcome \u0027would be good for this country\u0027. Pressed for a third time by interviewer Justin Webb on whether she would quit if Mrs May went for the no-deal option, Miss Rudd cut him short, saying: \u0027Thank you very much, Justin.\u0027 But asked again later whether she would resign, following a speech on welfare in south London, she said: \u0027I am committed to making sure that we get the Withdrawal Agreement through next week.\u0027I have been in and out of Cabinet and I find you have more influence in Cabinet.\u0027Meanwhile it emerged that former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has received more than £23,000 from Tory election guru Sir Lynton Crosby, in a sign that he may be considering a potential leadership bid.

The kapo looked Fritz in the eye. ‘If you want to go on living, you have to forget your father.’‘That’s impossible,’ he replied. After a few days of agonising, he returned to the kapo with an extraordinary request: ‘I need you to pull whatever strings you can to get me on the Auschwitz transfer.’The kapo was aghast. ‘What you’re asking is suicide.’ But Fritz was adamant. ‘I want to be with my papa, no matter what happens. I can’t go on living without him.’And so it was that two days later, Fritz and Gustav were herded on to a cattle wagon – their destination a place synonymous with murder on an industrial scale.There are many Holocaust stories, but not like the tale of Gustav and Fritz Kleinmann. Not only did they experience the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps from the first mass arrests in the late 1930s all the way through to eventual liberation, but they went through the whole inferno together, father and son. That makes them unique.More than luck or circumstance, it was their love and devotion to each other that kept them alive. ‘The boy is my greatest joy,’ Gustav wrote in his secret diary. ‘We strengthen each other. We are one, inseparable.’The doctor double act who can help you live healthier for...Trial for HIV prevention drug PrEP could DOUBLE after...Share this articleTogether, they endured a six-year odyssey through the hell of the camps, beginning with three years at Buchenwald, where Gustav so nearly became one of the tens of thousands to die in its unimaginably harsh conditions. Yet, however remarkable their story would prove to be, before the Nazis tore them apart there was nothing unusual about Gustav’s family.A decorated hero of the Great War, Gustav had married his sweetheart Tini and they were raising their four children – Fritz, Edith, Herta and Kurt – in a small apartment in Vienna, where he worked as a master upholsterer. Everything changed in March 1938, when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany. Under the Nuremberg Laws, Austrian Jews were stripped of their citizenship. In April that year, Fritz, then 14 and training to enter his father’s trade, was expelled from the Trade School. Gustav’s workshop was seized. Those caught buying from Jews were made to stand with a sign: ‘I am an Aryan, but a swine – I bought this in a Jewish shop.’A month later, the family dressed in their best outfits for a photograph. The photographer caught Gustav’s apprehensiveness and the stoicism of Tini’s dark eyes. It had been Tini’s urging that had brought them to the studio. She had a foreboding that the family might not be together for much longer and wanted to capture her children’s image while she had the chance.The hammer blow came on a Sunday in September 1939, when Tini was in the apartment with Herta, Fritz and Kurt. Four men arrived, all neighbours. All were working men like Gustav – friends with wives she knew, whose children had once played with hers.‘We want your husband,’ one said. ‘We have orders. If he isn’t here, we’re to take the lad.’ He nodded at Fritz. Tini felt as if she’d been physically beaten. They took hold of her precious boy and marched him out.When Gustav returned and heard what had happened, he turned around and headed for the door, intending to go straight to the police. Tini grabbed his arm. ‘Don’t,’ she said. ‘They’ll take you.’‘I’m not leaving Fritzl in their hands,’ he replied.‘No!’ Tini pleaded. ‘You have to run away, go somewhere and hide.’But there was no dissuading him. Leaving Tini in tears, Gustav walked quickly to the police station and announced: ‘I’m Gustav Kleinmann. I’m here to turn myself in. You have my son. Take me and let him go.’ The policeman glanced around. ‘Get the hell out of here,’ he muttered.Bewildered, Gustav left the building. He went home to find Tini distraught that Fritz was still gone. ‘I’ll try again tomorrow,’ Gustav said. But at 2am, a tide of men surged into the apartment. There was weeping, there were pleas, and final desperate words between husband and wife. And then it was all over. The door slammed, and Gustav was gone.Each morning, an hour and a half before dawn, shrill whistles yanked the prisoners from their sleep. Then came the kapos, yelling at them to hurry.Outside, Buchenwald was ablaze with electric light along the fence lines, atop the guard towers and in the walkways. People were herded to the square for roll call, standing motionless and shivering in their pitiful clothes for two hours. When it was time to go to work, sunrise was beginning to lighten the landscape.Gustav and Fritz had been assigned to the quarry detail, working as wagon haulers. All day, they and 14 other men had to heave and push a laden wagon weighing around four and a half tons up the hill, a distance of more than 800 yards, lashed and yelled at by kapos. Falls were frequent, with fractured limbs and broken heads. The injured would be taken to the infirmary or, if they were Jews, to the Death Block – a holding barrack for the terminally sick.Gustav and Fritz toiled on day after day, miraculously managing to avoid both punishment and injury. ‘We are proving ourselves,’ Gustav wrote in his diary.But things turned very different one day in November, after a failed assassination attempt on Hitler in Munich. When the prisoners lined up in the square, the kapos went along the ranks, grabbing every 20th man and shoving him forward. One of them was Fritz.A heavy wooden table with straps dangling from it was dragged on to the square. The Bock – the whipping bench. Fritz’s jacket and shirt were removed and his trousers pulled down. Gustav watched helplessly as the first lash landed like a razor cut across Fritz’s buttocks.‘Count!’ they yelled at their victim. ‘One,’ Fritz said. The bull-whip cut across his flesh again. ‘Two,’ he gasped. Fritz struggled to concentrate, knowing that if he lost count the lashes would start over again.At last the count reached 25 the strap was loosened and he was forced to his feet. Before his father’s eyes he was helped away, bleeding, his body on fire with pain, his mind stunned as the next unfortunate was dragged to the Bock.Despite his agony, Fritz was more worried about his papa than about himself. Dysentery and fever plagued the camp, and now the older man had caught the sickness.During roll call he swayed, shivering, his senses failing. He was unconscious before he hit the ground. When he woke, he was on his back. In his hazy, febrile state, Gustav dimly realised that he must be in the block set aside for hopeless cases, from which people rarely emerged alive. The Death Block. The air was thick, stifling, filled with groans and an atmosphere of hopelessness.As the days wore on, Fritz visited his papa whenever he could. The dysentery had failed to kill him, and the worst had passed.However, it was obvious to Gustav that he would never get well in this environment. After two weeks, Gustav begged to be discharged, but doctors wouldn’t let him go. He was far too weak to survive. Gustav was determined and asked Fritz to help him to his feet. With Fritz guiding his papa’s faltering steps, father and son slipped out of the Death Block together.It was October 1942 when they arrived at the most notorious of all the camps. Fritz had been allowed to go with his father and on their journey to Auschwitz, Gustav wrote: ‘Everyone is saying it is a journey to death, but Fritzl and I do not let our heads hang down. I tell myself that a man can only die once.’Fritz saw the marks of abuse and the signs of impending death in all his fellow prisoners, including himself: bruises, broken bones, sores, scabs and gapped teeth.The prisoners were able to shower once a week, but it was an ordeal. After showering, only the first men out got dry towels, so if you lagged behind you got nothing but a soaking rag and had to walk back to the barrack dripping, even in the coldest winter weather. Pneumonia was endemic, and often fatal. Food was distributed in the barrack. Only a few bowls were provided, so the first to get their helping of soup had to wolf it down so as not to keep the others waiting. If you managed to acquire your own spoon, you would guard it with your life.Having a decent pair of shoes was essential. If they were too large or too small, they chafed and caused blisters. Socks were rare, and many substituted strips of fabric torn from the tails of their camp-issue shirts. This in itself was risky, because damaging SS property was classed as sabotage.Gustav and Fritz were sent to a sub-camp within Auschwitz called Monowitz. Within weeks, most of their Buchenwald comrades had been sent to their deaths, but – against the odds – the pair had managed to survive as a result of their useful labouring skills. Fritz had been building the new camp, while his father had worked as a carpenter and upholsterer.Despite the overwhelming danger, Fritz became involved in a covert resistance against the SS, passing information to other prisoners about progress of the war, details he’d picked up from the civilians he worked with.One day he was seized, driven from the camp and accused by the head of the Auschwitz Gestapo of planning a large-scale escape, which he knew nothing about.He was lashed again, this time 60 times. Still he refused to name friends involved in the resistance.          Fritz, 17, at Buchenwald in 1940Fritz was allowed to return to camp, but fearing the Gestapo would return to look for him, his comrades came up with a daring plan: they hid him in an isolation room in the hospital, and recorded his death with the authorities. Weeks passed as Fritz recovered, now with a new identity – taken from a deceased typhus patient –and a new job as a warehouseman. So horrific was the death rate at Auschwitz that few prisoners were easily recognisable.Yet not knowing the truth, his father’s agony continued.One evening a friend came to see Gustav. ‘Follow me,’ he indicated, and led the older man down away from the road and towards the bathing block.In the low light inside, he saw the outline of a man standing back in the shadows. The figure came forward, his features resolving into the face of Fritz. It was miraculous. For Gustav, to hold his son in his arms again, to inhale the smell of him, to hear his voice, was beyond hope, beyond everything.Together they remained until January 1945, when Auschwitz was evacuated as Russian troops neared. They and thousands of other prisoners were forced to trudge through the snow, away from the advancing Red Army.Then they were put on trains bound for camps deeper inside the Reich. Their destination was Mauthausen in Austria, but father and son had decided to seize the chance to make their escape.When it came to it, Gustav, 53 years old and exhausted, didn’t have the strength to attempt it. Yet he couldn’t deny his son the chance to live. It would be a wrenching pain to part, but he urged Fritz to go alone.Fritz embraced his papa, and with his help climbed the slippery side wall of the wagon. He peered anxiously towards the brake houses on the adjacent wagons, occupied by armed SS guards. The train was thundering along at its maximum speed. Screwing up his courage, Fritz launched himself into the night and the rushing, freezing air.          Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland was infamous for the horror what went on insideFritz’s brave escape would not succeed, however. Despite his father’s fervent prayers, he was recaptured and imprisoned in Mauthausen – although the train itself was then erted and took Gustav to a different camp, Mittelbau-Dora. Father and son spent three months praying the other had been able to cling to life.And their prayers were answered. Mittelbau-Dora was liberated by US troops in April Mauthausen in May. When Fritz was first checked into an evacuation hospital, his weight was recorded as 5st 7lb, but he gradually regained strength. He returned home to Vienna, but found himself alone: his mother and sister Herta had been murdered by the Nazis, while Kurt had found sanctuary in America and Edith in England. He had no idea if his father was alive.It was September by the time Gustav, too, finally made his way home and went to the apartment building where his workshop used to be. There he found the one person he most longed to see: his beloved boy.They wept tears of joy. They were home and together again.© Jeremy Dronfield, 2019Extracted from The Boy Who Followed His Father Into Auschwitz, by Jeremy Dronfield, which is published by Michael Joseph on January 24, priced £12.99.

For about £99, testing kits which promise 100 per cent accurate next-day results can be bought online.Instead of requiring the physical presence at a clinic of both parties being tested, they involve only swabs taken from the inside cheeks of father and child, which are then packaged up and posted to the company.As long as the man is named on the child’s birth certificate, or has parental responsibility, no permission is required from either the mother or child, meaning the tests can be carried out in total secrecy.EXCLUSIVE: \u0027I don\u0027t know who my real dad is and I don\u0027t...\u0027Boys, let\u0027s have a cry and hug and get back to where we...Share this articleSome websites suggest DNA can be taken from children while they are asleep, to avoid awkward questions, particularly if the children are older.In some US states, concern over this has led to a recent ban on DIY home DNA testing, with all tests now having to be ordered by a doctor or court official and conducted under their supervision. In Britain, there is no such legislation currently being considered.Experts warn that the shock of learning a child is not biologically theirs can lead to severe emotional distress for some men, for which they may not be prepared. Laura House, a genetic genealogist, said that the boom in simple and quick DNA testing has overwhelmed the small number of trained genetic counsellors in the UK.‘There is a profound shortage of trained counsellors who can help people deal with what can be a devastatingly shocking discovery,’ she said. ‘People now get life-changing results via email while sitting alone on their sofa and they are often totally unprepared to navigate the fallout.’Last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed the case of Moneysupermarket.com co-founder Richard Mason, who discovered the three sons he had raised as his own with his ex-wife Kate were not biologically his.          Richard Mason (left) with partner Emma (right) has revealed he discovered the three sons he had raised for more than 20 years were not his when doctors told him he had been infertile since birthMr Mason’s devastating realisation was the result of his being diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which led doctors to inform him he had been infertile since birth.After the diagnosis, he confronted his ex-wife and uncovered the truth that his sons had been conceived by another man with whom she had conducted a four-year affair.The rising numbers of men turning to paternity testing suggests there are many who feel they may have been duped by women.Mr Thomas said: ‘Sometimes men will be delighted to learn they aren’t the father – usually when a woman with whom they have been having a casual relationship tells him he has fathered a baby and he can prove otherwise. In other cases it’s the mother who’s ordered the test to “shut the father up”.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Joe Biden tells Democrats hes running President","story":"    President Donald Trump called in to Fox News host Jeanine Pirro\u0027s show on Saturday night and dismissed Biden\u0027s chances of unseating him in the next election          Biden\u0027s younger brother, Frank, 65, believes that the former Vice President will run.

After three full days of debate, Mrs May’s allies are braced for a thumping defeat, with efforts focused on keeping the tally to ‘under three figures’.Mrs May will likely address MPs and the public late on Tuesday evening or early on Wednesday, with Ministers expecting her to announce yet another trip to Brussels to try to squeeze more concessions from the EU.Officials in Brussels, Dublin and London are all said to be ‘acutely aware’ that the backstop is the last major sticking point to a deal being done, with the Irish government expected to come under increased pressure to soften their objections to the measure being watered down.But last night Brussels sources said in response to the likely defeat, attention would instead begin by focusing on a rewriting of the non-legally binding political declaration that sets out EU and UK hopes for future trade arrangements rather than reopening the withdrawal agreement treaty on the terms of orce.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/597685885ddab5a929abbe233613f5137cb3c37c/0_260_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d63950c3b0b7fa0a52b7e6510c19862","title":"buy guardian classic photograph early morning frost","story":"This week in our regular series, an atmospheric image of early morning frost on the North Downs, Kent, 2010, by Martin GodwinThis atmospheric picture was taken near photographer Martin Godwin’s home on the North Downs, near Biggin Hill, in early January 2010.

A growing chorus of global leaders spent 2018 warning that the leveraged loan mountain was getting dangerously large and inviting comparisons with the financial crisis a decade ago.The Bank of England, Australia’s central bank, the International Monetary Fund and members of the US Federal Reserve have raised red flags over so-called leveraged loans, which are offered to companies already in debt but often come with few strings attached.In October last year the Bank’s financial policy committee, which monitors the health of the financial system, pointedly raised the spectre of the 2007-08 credit crunch. It said the “global leveraged loan market was larger than – and was growing as quickly as – the US sub-prime mortgage market had been in 2006”.As with the sub-prime crisis, the bank added, underwriting standards had slipped – in other words, risky corporate debt was too easy to get right now. “Given the decline in underwriting standards, investors in leveraged loans are at increasing risk of loss,” said the Bank.The key question now is whether a bubble in a different corner of the debt market could trigger a market panic. “A quote wrongly attributed to Mark Twain fits here: history rarely repeats, but it does rhyme,” said Rasheed Saleuddin, a research associate at the University of Cambridge’s Judge Business School.While he said it was hard to see the next financial crash coming directly from a failure in the leveraged loan market, Saleuddin added that there was a chance that “small changes in default rates in the loans or even in expectations of same could cause a meltdown”.In the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, banks were so keen to lend that they liberally handed out mortgages to customers with weak or no credit histories who ended up defaulting when times got tough. Those mortgages had been bundled together and turned into investable products, causing a chain reaction of losses that spread like wildfire throughout the financial system and caused a global downturn.A decade later, rather than doling out risky loans to homeowners, banks are handing out leveraged loans to indebted companies. Many are also “covenant-lite”, meaning they come with fewer strings attached for borrowers, and as a result, present greater risk for lenders.But since most loans are sold on and packaged as collateralised loan obligations, or CLOs, there are fewer incentives to impose strict terms. Leveraged loans also come with floating rates, making them more attractive for investors, who receive higher interest payments when rates rise.Amir Amel-Zadeh, an associate professor at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School, explained that investors in leveraged loans, loan mutual funds and CLOs could face higher losses than investors in the same products during the 2008 crisis due to lower lending standards, an increase in covenant-lite loans and higher levels of corporate indebtedness than 10 years ago.But while the trends in the CLO market were similar, he said the scale was nowhere near the mortgage securitisation market in 2008 – at about a tenth of the size. “So at first sight it is not as worrying from a systemic risk point of view. However, if economic conditions worsen, it can lead to losses for many investors and lead to a similar dry-up in liquidity in these instruments as we have witnessed with sub-prime mortgage securitisations during the 2008 crisis.”Reports have already emerged that the market for CLOs may be cooling, as uncertainty grips financial markets. With fewer investors lining up to take a slice of the leveraged loan market, prices have dropped, and banks have been postponing sales of leveraged loans to investors as a result. “If banks have to keep the loans on their books they will be exposed to the price risk,” Amel-Zadeh said.Without a hungry market to sell leveraged loans to, banks may be less willing to lend so liberally to indebted companies. And without further loans to feed their debt habits, companies could be at risk of default. This particular debt market will be one to watch in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/135d5bf64b84467e4d46f522b7f0e43c88a09f24/0_117_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=478ab1cc12ba5c7a0dd4eac3718d6ce5","title":"brexit jeremy corbyn only listens leavers why labour","story":"‘So what,” the schoolboy son of a friend asked, while being forced to listen to the Today programme on the school run, “was politics before Brexit?”This brought back memories of my own naive inquiry of my father at the end of the second world war: “Will there be any more news, Daddy?” Not too enlightened for an embryonic journalist, but you can see the point.Many people, not least your correspondent, are concerned about the way the threat of Brexit has been erting attention from a host of economic and social problems. Yet the focus on Brexit is necessary, because if it were allowed to go ahead, in any form, it would magnify those domestic problems, and be almost bound to have a deleterious impact on international relations.As it is, I am lost in admiration for the way our European partners have put up with our ministers making juvenile complaints about them – for all the world as if the other 27 had made a request to abandon us, rather than the reverse.As one of my Brussels contacts wrote to me in a New Year message: “We are watching with hard-to-describe feelings.”Now, in common, I imagine, with many others, I find myself watching the behaviour of the leader of the Labour party with hard-to-describe feelings. My feelings towards some of his colleagues are easier to describe. It is obvious that Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has been doing his level best to try to knock some sense into Corbyn. The latter’s recent revelation in the  to my colleague Heather Stewart that, if elected prime minister he planned to go ahead with Brexit, was deeply offensive to the vast majority of Labour members, who are Remainers.Perhaps Corbyn thinks he has been playing a clever game, keeping the Leave minority of Labour voters on board. However, this is at the expense of alienating the vast majority.Given the popular view that the referendum result was principally swayed by the discontent of the “left behind” and those with “nothing to lose”, I was interested in the point Corbyn made last week that the left-behind in Mansfield may have voted Leave but the left-behind in Tottenham elected to Remain.But what do you make of a so-called leader of the opposition who “cannot wish away the votes of 17 million people who wanted to leave”? What this means, given the preponderance of Labour people who voted to remain, is that a Labour leader affects to be swayed more by the Conservative supporters whose government he wishes to dislodge. It is as if, in the early 1980s, he would have opted for Thatcherism, or sado-monetarism, because more Conservatives voted for what the Conservative government of that era became.Corbyn is a walking and talking disaster. Just imagine how different things would be now if the increasingly impressive Yvette Cooper had beaten him to the Labour leadership. She is right to back an extension to article 50 – a move also championed by the estimable Lord Kerr, who, when in the Foreign Office, actually drafted article 50.Bad business, referendums, creating the opportunity for the surfacing of discontents that often have nothing to do with the nominal issue at hand. And I keep having to remind people that a host of very prosperous people voted Leave, for reasons best known to themselves.Nevertheless, bad business though referendums may be, it seems to me that we are moving towards the need for yet another – a referendum to end referendums.Now, as Robert Shrimsley observes in the Financial Times, a second referendum requires Corbyn’s support, but “that support is not forthcoming since he is not interested in stopping Brexit, only in bringing down the government”. But the truth that dare not speak its name is that, in the face of the worst Conservative government most people can remember, Labour should be 20 or 30 points ahead in the polls. One has an awful suspicion that Corbyn is incapable of winning an election anyway.Good luck to Starmer, Cooper, Hilary Benn and others in trying to bring their leader to his senses. He it was who decreed that Labour party policy should be determined by the members. I don’t know Corbyn’s taste in music, but my friend the impresario Lee Menzies recently reminded me of that Ira Gershwin line: “Let’s call the whole thing off.”William Keegan’s new book, Nine Crises – Fifty Years of Covering the British Economy From Devaluation To Brexit, will be published by Biteback on Thursday 24 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac61c4b2f7243d1ee5b8547f49a6fa4775b003a/0_30_1476_886/master/1476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de641d086e9df7e75a35bc548ca4e3e7","title":"david cameron and art of blaming other people","story":"No one can accuse the former Tory prime minister of being power hungry. What he’ll be remembered for is passing the buckDavid Cameron really loved organising votes for things, didn’t he? That was his answer to everything. I was reminded of this when I read that the elected police and crime commissioners, which his government introduced to oversee the constabularies of England and Wales, aren’t doing a very good job. According to the head of the National Crime Agency, they’re all about stopping speeding and burglary, and not so hot on organised crime, online child abuse and modern slavery.It’s not surprising. Making some local elected officials the overseers of the police is effectively putting the Neighbourhood Watch in charge of law enforcement strategy. They’re going to address the issues most noticeable to the very small percentage of people who might turn out to vote for them. If they were in charge of healthcare, all the money would go to treating RSI caused by overenergetic net-curtain twitching. Their best chance of arresting a mafia boss is if he plays the music too loudly at his Christmas party.But it’s odd that David Cameron was so keen on holding votes when his career as prime minister began with him failing to win an election. I’m surprised people don’t talk about that more, because it’s quite remarkable.It was 2010 and the world was reeling from the worst financial crisis in nearly a century and, by some reckonings, of all time. Britain is depressingly reliant on the financial services sector, so it was particularly scary here. The mood was not good. On top of that, the governing party had been in power for well over a decade, had started a disastrous war, and its charismatic twice-re-elected leader had been replaced, just before the banking meltdown, by a better man but a markedly worse politician.Therefore Cameron faced a sitting prime minister who, since he’d been chancellor of the exchequer for most of the Labour years, could hardly disassociate himself from the country’s economic woes but had never actually won an election as party leader – so the perfect combination of high perceived responsibility for what had gone wrong with low perceived democratic legitimacy – and who was also terrible at PR at the best of times and, 2010 being for him the worst of times, was breaking new records in his awfulness at PR, with the energetic help of the rightwing press. And, just to recap, the economy was screwed, the Middle East was screwed and the same bunch had been in power for a James Bond and a half.One could be forgiven for thinking that, under those circumstances, the opposition would win the general election even if it were led by a turd. I mean a literal turd, not the metaphorical turd that David Cameron turned out to be. Just an actual stick of excrement in a suit, maybe with a smile drawn on in Tippex and a slogan underneath saying “Vote Conservative” in Comic Sans, should have been enough to beat the Labour party in 2010.Actually, it was a bit like 1997 in that there was a huge groundswell in favour of a change of government. Except, to be fair, in 1997 the economy wasn’t in too bad a shape. And the other difference is that in 1997 the opposition swept to power with a parliamentary majority of 179 while in 2010 there was a hung parliament.There was a hung parliament! When led by David Cameron, the Tories, who are overwhelmingly the best at elections, couldn’t do better than a hung parliament as the country descended into penury and the exhausted grouchy old guy, who’d been grimly clutching the purse strings since the previous century, miserably trudged around calling people bigots. That’s quite a spectacular underperformance by the Conservatives. But that fact sort of got lost because, thanks to the Labour movement’s deep-rooted self-loathing, this notably mild setback was taken as justification to end the party’s whole experiment in electability. The great swaths of the centre ground Cameron failed to conquer, Labour has since abandoned to save the Tories the job. Well done, everyone.Still, you’d expect the experience of 2010 to make David Cameron a bit tentative about calling votes. But no, he really got a taste for them. It’s like they say about gambling addicts: he became hooked on the endorphin rush he felt when he lost. And, to be fair on him, he had to wait quite a while for his next fix. The AV referendum, the Scottish independence referendum and, most surprisingly of all, the 2015 general election all somehow went his way. He must have been absolutely gibbering for a honk on the disappointment pipe by the time he called the Brexit referendum – but then he massively overdosed on loss and, like when Obelix fell in the magic potion, it had a permanent effect, and so now he’ll be a total loser until the day he dies.A key advantage for politicians of holding lots of votes to decide what should be done is that it means that, arguably, nothing is their fault. It’s the “will of the people” and they just obey it. Or rather the civil service obeys it and the politicians pontificate about respecting democracy as if they’ve accomplished anything other than proving themselves obsolete.At least it shows they’re not power-crazed, I suppose. Cameron’s worst enemy wouldn’t accuse him of that. Despite obviously wanting to be prime minister, he didn’t seem that keen to be in charge of anything. And nothing demonstrates that better than the elected police and crime commissioners.It was pretty ominous, really. What clearer sign could there be that the prime minister expected things to go badly, that government was going to retreat from its traditional duties and leave us to fate? He didn’t want control over how policing was done – he wanted whatever happened to be the fault of some amateurish local worthies.

And did anyone notice she was a woman?Phew. Let’s be thankful that Fiona Bruce didn’t mess up during her first outing as host on Question Time.By Bruce messing up, I mean, by crying, becoming hysterical, fiddling with her bra strap, that kind of thing. After all, she is a mere woman and I was concerned that she would do something stupid or feminine. (Same thing?) Instead, armed with only decades of professional experience, Bruce skilfully did the job that she was asked to do, asking questions, being firm with panellists, steering the debate, without once talking about her feelings. It’s just amazing what women can do these days – serious television gigs aren’t so easy when you haven’t got the right male body parts to command instant respect...That’s quite enough snark. I had some thoughts about Bruce’s previous stint on Antiques Roadshow but I’ll leave that to whoever covers the Question Time where Jeremy Corbyn appears in that adorable dusty Breton mariner’s cap. (“What’s that worthless relic you’ve got dangling beneath your hat?”). I’m more minded to talk about sexism, specifically, the kind of thinly veiled sexism that tends to dart about in the shadows, in the manner of a media-cum-Twitter Nosferatu whenever a woman takes over a man’s job.Admittedly, David Dimbleby was the Question Time anchor for a quarter of a century, so anyone taking over, male or female, would have felt the heat. Arguably though, Bruce, the first permanent female host in the show’s 40-year history, received rather more scrutiny. The fuss was at once funny and deeply tiring and not just because, beforehand, we had to endure what was frequently (and doubtless falsely) portrayed as some kind of TV lady catfight between other female presenters in the running for the role.When Bruce took over, it was genuinely interesting to see how she’d play it, but that should have been it, so far as suspense went. It wasn’t her first presenting gig and she has a news background – it wasn’t as though she’d been drafted in from CBeebies or Hollyoaks. In the event, she reaped praise, with many observing that she could singlehandedly revitalise an increasingly bad-tempered and flagging format. However, among the genuine, deserved accolades, was there the occasional malodorous whiff of “didn’t the little lady do well?”. As though, for some, a gender-themed sword of Damocles had been hovering over Bruce’s debut – with her not just representing herself, but all females who have the audacity to take a man’s place?Back on Planet Sane, even if Bruce hadn’t done well, even if she’d done horribly, it would have had nothing to do with her sex. So bravo, Ms Bruce, the first female presenter of Question Time – it should only take certain people another 40 years to get over the novelty.Admit it, the super-rich split up better than the rest of us. They “play nice”, at least in public. The very thing you’d think that would cause all the trouble – the mega-dosh – somehow calms everything down.Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, and his wife, the novelist MacKenzie Bezos, (combined wealth $137bn, some of which probably should have been paid to the UK in taxes) released a joint statement about parting after 25 years: following “a long period of loving exploration and trial separation”. Does this mean that, before splitting, Jeff was sent on a camping trip to think about his adul… (sorry, lawyers!), I mean his behaviour, perchance using one of the many spacious, reasonably priced tents that Amazon has to offer – or something more spiritual entirely?The couple go on to say that they are “deeply grateful for every one of the years that we’ve been married to each other”. Really? Wasn’t 2018 a tad tricky? The statement concludes: “If we had known that we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again.” Sadly, in real life, this priceless gift of prophecy might have caused rows, perhaps leading to an earlier, uglier breakup: “What’s the point if we’re going to split anyway! And, yeah, I do think you killed the independent bookstore!”But the Bezoses deserve praise for ending their marriage with dignity. Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin set the “conscious uncoupling” benchmark of the cloyingly harmonious passive-aggressive kind that makes ordinary folk wish their actual relationships were as warm and wonderful as other people’s irreconcilable differences. As F Scott Fitzgerald almost observed, the rich are different, even, it seems, when they’re telling each other to “do one!”. No arguments, no bitterness and, here, not even one of the biggest modern rows of all – who’s been ordering too much stuff from Amazon?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3b3d805d145d718dd2f963967fd5c3ec8a1dddd/0_170_4728_2837/master/4728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1297a71e0f07cf56160daa99033a1ab4","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of contrast","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘contrast’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘contrast’.Share your photos of what contrast means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 16 January at 10am.

She has worked in TV, film and theatre, and in 2012 was nominated as outstanding newcomer at the Evening Standard theatre awards for her performances in Our New Girl and Desire Under the Elms. She has won two Olivier awards: for best actress for People, Places and Things (2015) and best supporting actress in 2018 for her portrayal of Harper in Angels in America. She stars alongside Keira Knightley in Colette, in cinemas now.So, so good. It’s a film where the three main characters are women – Olivia Colman as Queen Anne, her lady-in-waiting Rachel Weisz, and social climber Emma Stone – and the men are the ones worried about their makeup and hair. Colman is just gloriously vile through the whole thing, and it made me think about the conversation we’re having with #MeToo. The film really stuck in my head because it’s about the nature of power and what it does to a human being, male or female – women are capable of being just as gross when given power.It’s on Netflix and it’s a terrifying look into the birth of reality TV and Instagram stars. It begins with Paris Hilton, who started that whole thing of becoming famous just being herself. There’s this misogynistic guy who’s an internet sensation, and underneath all that he just seems really unhappy. It made me think of how corrosive fame can be, particularly if it comes only as a result of something vacuous. I’m not on social media because the whole thing terrifies me. It makes me sad that we live in a world now where that’s what we idealise.Normal People by Sally RooneyThis is the story of a relationship over the course of many years, and it’s incredible. Sally Rooney is 27, and writes about an Ireland I didn’t grow up in but wish I had: much more free-thinking, not as repressed. It makes me hopeful for the future of the country, especially for young women. Her books are so completely believable, but it’s more the way she looks at relationships that is interesting to me. I’m just not used to reading that from Irish writers. Voices like hers doing so well makes me feel like we’re moving in the right direction.Florence + the Machine in New YorkIt’s brilliant. In it, Oprah interviews all sorts of people, like Malala Yousafzai, and her latest one is with Michelle Obama. But her best, I think, is with Maya Angelou, who is the kindest and most well-mannered and just beautiful human being. Angelou tells an incredible story about her and Tupac Shakur. They’re all just inspiring conversations about loving yourself and being kind to yourself. I can’t get enough of that sort of stuff, especially at the moment. As far as I’m concerned, Oprah is queen of the world.The Inheritance at the Noël Coward theatre, LondonIt’s a play-within-a-play inspired by Howards End, about a gay couple who we meet towards the end of their relationship. I really wanted to experience what people say they did when they saw Angels in America: this seven-hour epic. So I went and it was one of the most beautiful days at the theatre I’ve ever had: heartwarming and beautiful, and the performances were gorgeous. It felt like such a celebration and an honouring of the gay community in New York.

Last week Outlander star Tom Brittney complained about the emphasis on achieving a “built” body before auditions. British drama schools are also tackling the pressure on students to conform to a muscular type.“It is real and prevalent, and we are very aware,” said Vanessa Ewan, a senior lecturer in movement at Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.Speaking to Radio Times, Brittney admitted some of his roles were now dependent on a strict gym regimen and diet. “It’s tough. And I would hope the industry pulls back from that,” the actor said. Last summer the comic Noel Fielding also confessed he got more work when he looked thinner. Hard luck on a host of Bake Off.Such sentiments were echoed this weekend by a group of male acting students who fear, like Brittney, that appearing in peak condition is now part of their job.“Of course there is a responsibility to look after ourselves as we train,” said Russell Scott-Dickson, 21, a Belfast-born student at Arts Educational Schools in London. “But there is a pressure to look that bit leaner, because it is going to help. And agents say to us that our image is the most important part of the package. We all deal with it differently, but it can obviously lead to problems like body dysmorphia or eating illnesses.”The fad for “bulk and muscle” that trainee actors and tutors identify is the latest in a succession of key screen looks. In the 1950s, bare-chested stars such as Johnny Weissmuller of the Tarzan films, or Burt Lancaster in From Here to Eternity, were broad rather than toned. They were replaced in the 1960s by the clean-cut, preppy looks of Robert Redford and Paul Newman, while in Britain during the late 1980s what really counted was having the undernourished, rarefied outline of a Rupert Everett or a Julian Sands.The new age of brawn has been ushered in by Aidan Turner’s Poldark, Idris Elba’s Luther and Richard Madden’s Bodyguard. Even the languid and cerebral Holmes in the BBC’s Sherlock, as played by Benedict Cumberbatch, annoyed some viewers with his unfeasibly developed upper arms.“It is an odd phenomenon,” said Catherine Alexander, a course leader at Central. “We talk about it a lot.” Referring to the Game of Thrones actor, Alexander said she knew it as the Kit Harington effect and believed it actually limited performances.“It is detrimental when people build up too much muscle because we convey emotion through our chests. An overly muscular chest is a barrier. The actor can’t make that connection, so we encourage our students to stop doing weights all the time,” she said.Taylor Bradshaw, 20, a student from south London, welcomes the support he gets at ArtsEd, which offers a gym and a coach, but he understands the need to represent reality. “Hopefully we will play different kinds of people. Not all the parts out there are soldiers and bodyguards,” he said.Beefing up for a role can be seen as just part of the essential artifice of performance, one of the tricks replicated down the ages, from theatrical masks to the soft-focus camera lens and contemporary special effects of Hollywood but it is also a reflection of wider modern tastes.“We live in self-obsessed and image-conscious times and nowhere more so than in the TV and film industry,” said Bradshaw.Ewan, who runs a bodyidentityimage group at Central to help students, is worried about a blurring of lines between an actor’s personal image and the parts they hope to play. She also suspects the desire for bulk is about wanting control in a difficult marketplace. “The actor needs to discern the difference between a personal decision and a professional decision. The line is slim,” she said. “An actor faced with a free personal trainer in a first job sees that as a bonus and he may not recognise he is handing over more than he is gaining.”Drama schools, Ewan argues, are there to give actors the tools to transform without the need to change body shape. Leo Woodall, 22, another student, agrees and hopes the entertainment industry can avoid reproducing identikit leading men. The drive to look like the four American blockbusting stars, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pine and Chris Pratt, does not encourage good mental health.“While it is true people want to look at beautiful people, they also want to see real people with imperfections. I like to be in shape, but I would not want to get too big because it would restrict me,” he said.Even a top-ranked star like Evans is not happy with the trend. He has complained, along with the actor Armie Hammer, that being seen as a muscular hunk in the Captain America role may send his career off into a dead end. The answer might be to let visual effects do the work. Certainly, producers of mass-market entertainment spend a big proportion of the budget on improving the look of the stars. Los Angeles is home to several profitable low-profile effects companies that specialise in digitally beautifying every shot with patented programmes such as Flame or Beauty Box. And in the cruel world of high-definition cinema, these efforts to remove stomach rolls and improve silhouettes are now as concentrated on the male actors as the female.Ewan regularly points out to students at Central how much easier it is to put on muscle for a role, either with exercise, padded costumes, or with CGI, than it is to slim down. And she acknowledges that it is an issue female actors “have been dealing with for ever”. As Brittney remarked last week: “Maybe it’s the guys’ turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddc38a6654677ab5ee6bc512fa5329fdfa38af39/445_1455_4919_2950/master/4919.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3973282e4d9feefef103d92339e760a","title":"ella risbridger john underwood friendship life new family","story":"The death of her partner at the age of 25 was a devastating loss for Ella Risbridger. But she was never alone. For one thing, her mates would never have allowed that…I have written a lot of things in my life, but this year it has become clear to me that I only have one story to tell. That thing is often in disguise – maybe it’s a political article, maybe it’s a cookbook, maybe it’s a collection of poetry – but I’m writing the same thing, over and over again.It’s this: it’s nice to have a friend.I’ve never written anything that wasn’t really about the pure joy of meeting someone who gets it and gets you. In everything I ever write I’m trying to articulate why friends are so good, and why we devalue friendship in favour of other kinds of relationship, and how all relationships are more complicated and beautiful and boundless than the labels we stick on them.The word “friend” has to cover all manner of sins. It has to mean that girl you work with, but don’t want to offend a mutual Twitter follower you’ve never met, but speak to every day the flatmate who makes you toast every morning. It’s the same word for someone you’ve just met as for someone who has known you your whole life it’s the same word for somebody you kind of like as for somebody without whom you feel like you might die. We just don’t have the vocab because, culturally speaking, we don’t really believe that friendship matters.“We’re just friends,” we say, of someone we love dearly, but aren’t sleeping with. “Just friends, nothing more,” as if friendship were a sort of place on the road to monogamous sex-on-tap. Because we’re obsessed with couples, with The One. The One is Friendship Plus. The One is the most evolved Pokémon of love. This is, when you think about it, a profoundly curious idea: a real multiple-egg-single- basket distribution error.I didn’t used to think like this. Even with my flexible definitions of family, expanding and contracting depending on who was around, I was pretty sure that it was just a question of finding the right One. I thought that with the right One, I’d do it all properly. Nuclear family with all the bits correctly labelled, like a diagram in a science textbook.And then, you see, I met him. He was – and I am unbiased here – really something. He was a smasher. He was funny and mean and beautiful and clever, and I absolutely worshipped him, and then he died.There’s a bit in the 2002 classic About a Boy that I think about all the time. A thing that tiny Nicholas Hoult in his woolly hat says, just after his mum Toni Collette tries to kill herself. He says, “That’s when I realised: two people isn’t enough. You’ve got to have backup. If there are only two people, and one of you drops off the edge, you’re on your own.”My person, the writer John Underwood, dropped off the edge by degrees. He had cancer, to start with then he acquired a brain injury and then he died.The thing about his getting ill was this: he got sick at exactly the wrong age. We were the wrong age. I was just 22, he was 25, 25 is a year too old for the young person’s cancer unit, where they have PlayStations and support networks but much too young for the “how to tell your children you have cancer” and “mortgage support” leaflets.Perhaps if we’d been just a bit older, we’d have had a house and kids and a marriage certificate of our own, and if we’d have been just a bit younger, we’d have gone home to our parents and been kids again ourselves. But we were who we were, and we had what we had, and what we had was each other. We had each other, and our friends.“Friends are the family you choose” is a trite statement, but I watched as it became true. In the mad world of John’s sickness, friendship became to us something as important as any blood relationship, something as vital and meaningful and profound as any romantic relationship.Other people our age were bonding over nights out and drinking and occasional trips to A\u0026ampE. Other people our age never thought about blood counts or sperm banks or any other bodily fluids outside the context of a sexual health clinic. Other people our age lived in a world that seemed entirely distinct from ours, like two pieces of acetate laid over each other. I used to come out of the hospital and stare at people in pubs on my way home, baffled it could be Friday and baffled that Friday meant something still.It must be said that we were a pretty close-knit friendship group before my partner had cancer. We did elaborate birthday treats and dinners that went on until well past the last tube. We talked a lot. We walked a lot. We lay around on the sofa, drinking red wine and playing the guitar, like people from films. If this sounds romantic, it’s meant to: it was.What else could you call it? I met Caroline at a party my first year in London we locked eyes and fell hopelessly in love and knew we were best friends. A little while later we ran through the rain together, holding hands and laughing.Harry – a work colleague of John, and a stranger to me – turned up an hour early to a dinner party I’d forgotten was happening we started talking about music and pies and we’ve been doing that, pretty much, ever since.Lily offered me a doughnut in a pub Lettie asked me about a (cheerfully gaudy) statuette of Catherine of Aragon in my window I ran into Cornelia’s arms outside the Gare du Nord on an unseasonally warm October day a decade ago now I saw Katya in a queue and immediately texted a mutual friend to demand we be set up. In the romcom world, they call this a meet-cute. In the real world, we don’t have a vocabulary for meeting people we don’t want to sleep with. If I have a flexible definition of family, I also now have a flexible definition of romance. Which gives me a kind of freedom from overthinking things. Freedom to be different to change and to grow and to evolve.And in that way, once John was ill, our friendships became different. Our meet-cutes became real, profound, life-changing relationships. It was only then, when our world had fallen apart, that our friends became our family. We were forged in a kind of emotional fire, I suppose, and the word “friend” started to sound almost laughable. They were there, too. They were in the hospital with us they were at the end of the phone at two in the morning. They were there for our birthdays and Christmases when we couldn’t go to our families for fear of being far from the hospital. They were there for celebratory dinners whenever his blood counts got better and commiseration drinks when things got awful again. They slept in our bed and on our sofa and sat in hospital cafés for hours until I had a minute. They smuggled guitars and expensive meatball sandwiches into sterile wards folded laundry and answered emails and drove cars and were, in every sense, there.Some of them I’d known for a long time some I barely knew at all. If you said you’d been dating someone for a year, you’d imply a certain degree of seriousness to say you’ve only been friends with someone for a year implies in some ways that you barely know them. But they were there, and they were family.“Friend” seemed such a flimsy word to describe a person who had washed your clothes and helped you dress a person who had driven you to the beach so that you could yell into the sea, and filled your fridge, and cleaned your sink a person who had pushed squares of Marmite toast into your open mouth as if you were a baby bird a person who had curled herself around you as you slept so that if you woke you wouldn’t feel the coldness of the space across the double bed. “Friend” didn’t carry the kind of weight we needed it to bear – it didn’t carry the heft of the burden at all. It didn’t carry the duty, the responsibility, the care. It did not carry the love. It’s hard to write about this in a way that doesn’t feel fragile or melodramatic or saccharine: we don’t have the language.With Caroline, we went for “my sister”, often sometimes “my wife”. Our friend Harry became our collective “wayward nephew”: it seemed easier than explaining the complex intricacies of our gentle co-dependence. A gang of women I adored became my “aunts”, sending hampers and cards and constant support. Mark was our “London Dad” Lily mothered me and fed me fish fingers as she fed her own small daughter. The small daughter – our godchild – drew pictures.They were there the whole time, and they were there after he died and we were all left, reeling. But I was not on my own. I was never on my own. We had lost a pillar of our family, but there were enough of us left to hold each other up.“Maybe you will be worried about being alone now,” our godchild (seven) wrote to me carefully, after John died. “But, you are my family and you do not have to be!” This part was underlined twice, in red pen, with a ruler.We are friends, my goddaughter and I, in that we talk about things that we both like (pictures of horses, Taylor Swift) and build Lego together and she tells me, cryptically, about the gossip from Year Four. But she’s right: we’re more than that. We’re family.We’re family in the way my housemate Tash and I are family: we’re a household, technically speaking, because we share “at least one meal a day together” (what a lovely definition that is). But it’s more than that: she knows everything that happens to me, because she’s the one here. We have small domestic routines, and all the tiny intimacies that you learn when you live with someone. I make the tea she makes the toast. I cook she washes up.“You sound… married,” someone remarked the other day, and I told Tash this over dinner and we agreed it made sense. I don’t think we’re alone in this kind of non- marital domestic set-up: every week I hear about women living together to raise their children, or someone living with his adopted granny, or some other kind of non-nuclear communal living. “I used to think two wasn’t enough,” Nicholas Hoult also says, at the end of About a Boy, looking around at his new, chaotic life full of relationships that are impossible to articulate. “And now there were loads of people. I don’t think couples are the future. You need more than that. You need back-up.”I see tiny signs that we might be moving collectively away from that cultural burden of The One: queer culture in particular has taught me a great deal about perceptions of love. I like this I hope it means that one day we’ll have the language to explain it. But until then, I’ll keep looking. I’ll keep trying to articulate it, keep writing 2,000 words to try and say it better. For now, though, I’ll just keep flying this flag: it’s nice to have a friend.Midnight Chicken and Other Recipes Worth Living For by Ella Risbridger and Elisa Cunningham (Bloomsbury, £22).

Why else would we reach for resolutions as soon as we’ve retched the last of December into the loo, repopulating our gut with promises we know we won’t keep?It is the beginning of the year, so we must admit the drinks we drink are wrong, the food we eat will kill us, the clothes we wear expose our lack of understanding about cultural signifiers of class, and that we are sometimes sad. We must change. But what if, what if we… don’t? What if change is bad? No, bear with me. What if, most of us, we’re OK as we are? What if we accept that we will never have the upper arms of a professional swimmer, nor a marriage of the kind seen in the background of romcoms? What if we acknowledge that perpetual happiness would not be a rational reaction to the world or indeed to life as a human, and that the constant pursuit of such a thing often obscures our view of existing contentment? What if this year we decide that we’re, sort of, basically good enough?Of course, there is merit to a considered reassessment of what is lacking in our lives, and here, look, is a universal date on which such a thing might start. But this striving for betterness, this dragging ourselves through a muddy park on the frostiest day of the year, this idea that if we’re not hurting, we’re not living, well, I resent this. I resent it all.I resent the myth that we can find peace if we download the correct apps. I resent the lie that we can become more lovable through Pilates. I resent the promise that we will have more fun if we buy less comfortable shoes. I resent the idea that a reasonable goal is to recreate one’s 21-year-old body in that of a woman who is now 46. I resent the message that my life is a problem that must be fixed.And this is a message that gets harder and harder to avoid. Today, self-help is hidden in every purchase, like vegetables cut up very small in a child’s lunch. Whereas once there was half an aisle in the local bookshop offering hardbacks with screaming titles about love and success, now, in the midst of an apparent crisis of humanity, January sells infinite efforts in self-improvement. On top of losing weight and giving up alcohol, traditions now as ingrained as Christmas trees or elevenses, this year we must also perform them (among other things) with quiet knowledge about the fattening reality of diets and the truth about binge sobriety. We must accept that, and do it anyway. We must seek deeper relationships, we must meditate athletically, we must constantly strive, like wolves of Wall Street, except not in pursuit of money, which is vulgar, but instead a better quality of happiness, which is less so.We do this despite the fact that this is not our first January, and that we’ve seen how the story plays out. Every walk through town is a déjà vu of gym membership deals and opportunities to detox. Every magazine regifts a diet in different wrapping paper, scribbled over with words that tickle modern anxieties. The word “new” becomes its own prayer, new year, new you, new body, new bike, new relationship, new job, new routine, new skills, new sex life, new kitchen, new baby, new diagnosis, new trainers. Yesterday’s efforts appear offensive in their naivety, soiled by age – everything breaks as the year ends, falling to the floor with a thud and disturbing crack.Or, wait, does it? Does it? Things become confusing – the streetlights are still on when we wake. We try to hold two thoughts in our head at the same time – the feeling that we must change as the clock does, but also, that every year our panicking efforts rarely work to improve our lives, instead leaving us with the sour emptiness of failure, and having extended our overdraft for the privilege. The two thoughts fight in the dark like cats.Is there a compromise? We could cut down on meat, drink mindfully, jog around the park, but with no ambitions of perfecting ourselves. That might be nice? What about if this year we seek approval, not from the internet, but instead only from those we love? What if this year, we forget about trying to live longer, and instead enjoy the moments of glee in our existing day-to-days? What if, instead of cutting all alcohol from our lives for a month, we instead interrogate the things that make us want to drink too much? What if, instead of looking inwards, we stare cleanly out across this cold landscape of gentrified possibility, making sure the annual efforts to fix ourselves don’t distract us from fixing the world?

It’s her decision to strike. Now she’s made it, I think we will respond to how things develop and try not to feel too much panic.”Ratcliffe said his wife was scared that her decision would result in further reprisals from the Iranian authorities after her food rations were cut last week and a programme was aired on state TV in Iran repeating allegations she is a British spy. In particular, the couple fear her twice-weekly visits with their daughter, Gabriella, will be stopped as punishment for the hunger strike.“Outside contact has already been restricted,” said Ratcliffe. “When she was in solitary confinement she went on hunger strike for six days and they sent her family in to plead with her. It’s not impossible that family visits are disrupted for a bit. And then when she’s weak and vulnerable, family is sent back in to plead she should end it.”He added that the Foreign Office had sent him advice stressing the negative physical effects of a hunger strike, which he found too painful to read closely. “We know a hunger strike has significant physical consequences the longer it goes on for and Nazanin is feeling a strong sense, of trepidation. But there aren’t many ways she can say, ‘Enough is enough. Take me seriously’,” he said.Ratcliffe said his wife, who is 40 and has been detained in Evin since her arrest in April 2016, had made the decision to strike because she wanted to send a message that she was “at the end” and “cannot take any more”.She has been denied medical attention for lumps in her breasts and refused neurological care for neck pains and numbness in her arms and legs, despite being referred by the prison doctor for specialist treatment for both. She has also been banned from seeing an outside psychiatrist.Ratcliffe has been struggling to keep his wife’s spirits up and simultaneously cope with his own anxieties. “This week I haven’t gone to sleep before about 2am and I’ve been waking up early. I carry on because you just do, don’t you? But I’ve been half dreading this moment and calming myself that the moment isn’t actually here yet. It certainly feels like the stakes have risen significantly. I think we’re on the precipice,” he said.He sees the decision to deny his wife treatment as an assertion of power by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. “They obviously don’t think she’s going to die this week and are just asserting that they are in charge. So everyone else can agree she needs medical treatment, and the Foreign Office can demand it, but they’re the ones who give the say-so, and they haven’t. That’s my reading of it.”Neither he nor Zaghari-Ratcliffe have been able to bring themselves to watch the lengthy TV documentary that was broadcast on Iranian state TV, showing secretly-filmed footage of her arrest at Tehran airport. “The other prisoners watched it. Nazanin couldn’t watch it. She left the room. But she heard it and she heard again the voices of her interrogators ... I still haven’t be able to watch it either.”Both of them found the broadcast shocking. “It’s the idea that, actually, all of this has been secretly filmed on a secret camera, perhaps hidden in a bag. It’s very violating.” He thinks broadcasting the footage was a way of sending a powerful message to the Iranian diaspora: “We can take who we want. No one can stop us. This could happen to you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

Labour whips have told MPs the no-confidence vote is likely to be tabled within hours of a government loss, with the actual vote taking place on Wednesday.The news comes before what promises to be one of the most tumultuous 24 hours in recent parliamentary history in which, barring another delay, May will put her Brexit deal to parliament despite deep and widespread opposition across the Commons, including from many MPs inside her own party.A senior shadow cabinet member said: “There is now recognition that we cannot wait any longer. If May goes down to defeat and she does not resign and call an election, this is the moment we have to act.”Senior Tories said on Saturday that they could not see how the prime minister could win the meaningful vote “in any circumstances” and that a defeat by less than 100 would now be regarded as the best she could hope for.But even if she suffered a loss of closer to 200, which many Tories fear could be the case, Conservative MPs and ministers still expect her to stagger on and seek to bring an improved offer back to the Commons for a further vote within weeks.Although senior Labour figures accept they are unlikely to win a no-confidence vote, as the 10 Democratic Unionist MPs have said they will back the government, the move will highlight the fragility of May’s hold on power as the Brexit crisis deepens.Yet should Corbyn fail to force an election, it will place the Labour leader under greater pressure from many of his own MPs, as well as party members and supporters, to throw his weight behind a second referendum as the way to break the Brexit impasse.Labour’s current policy is to seek to force an election, and if it wins, to renegotiate a new Brexit deal. Senior shadow cabinet figures said any further delay in tabling a no-confidence motion will make that position untenable, as there will be insufficient time before Britain’s exit from the EU on 29 March to hold an election.The Observer understands that if Corbyn were to delay tabling a vote of no confidence, senior Labour MPs would table one themselves in the hope of forcing the leadership to back a second referendum. Angela Smith, Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said: “The time for prevarication is over. If May’s deal fails we have to test the will of the house and if we fail, we must consider all options including campaigning for a second referendum as this is party policy.”A Labour spokesman, while not confirming a vote on Tuesday, said that while the timing of a no-confidence vote had not been fixed, MPs had been told to be ready. Barry Gardiner, the shadow trade minister, said last week that a vote of no confidence would “obviously” have to follow immediately after a defeat for May’s deal.A Momentum activist, Michael Chessum, spokesman for the leftwing anti-Brexit campaign Another Europe is Possible, said that if Labour won the confidence vote, it would be time for Corbyn to back a second referendum as part of the Labour manifesto. If it lost, it should campaign for one as the official opposition.He said: “Proposing a no-confidence motion is the first step for either scenario, and we need to get on with it.” Labour campaigners for a second referendum claim that the party’s policy forum has received more than 13,000 emails and letters urging Corbyn to oppose Brexit.Writing in the Observer, London’s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan said that he will step up his campaign for another referendum if an election is not called immediately: “A public vote would not only allow us to move beyond the current stalemate but would actually start the desperately needed process of healing the deep isions that have opened within our society.”Roy Hattersley, the veteran Labour politician, also threw his weight behind a second referendum on Saturday, saying the British people had “a right to cast a vote on the merits” of May’s deal.Meanwhile, pro-remain cabinet ministers are preparing to push for a softer Brexit this week. In the event of a defeat for May, they are poised to back a plan B that would prevent Britain from signing its own trade deals.It is understood some believe that joining a permanent customs union with the EU could be enough to secure a Commons majority for May’s deal. This could be one option put forward in a series of indicative votes to test the views of MPs on alternatives if her plan is thrown out. Such a move would potentially attract a bloc of Labour MPs. With a critical week ahead, Tory rebels are already plotting a series of measures designed to hand more power to parliament over Brexit. One senior figure said that a “legally copper-bottomed” plan had already been drawn up to “give parliament control of the Brexit negotiation and stop a no-deal Brexit” should May’s deal be voted down.A vote to show there is a Commons majority in favour of delaying Brexit is also being plotted by a cross-party group of MPs. “If we are not crashing out and we are not going for the PM’s deal, I cannot believe that article 50 does not have to be extended,” said one of those involved.The business secretary, Greg Clark, also writing in the Observer, has appealed to pro-Brexit Labour MPs to back May’s deal, insisting that the government would protect workers’ rights when the UK is outside the EU. He pledged to back an amendment proposed by Labour MPs on the issue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60b3a778251419d5ba1116c6e7dd3236477712c1/0_345_5589_3355/master/5589.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2df80cbfd1a9e3fab677a5433cd0005","title":"brexit brings surprise boost bulgarian resorts","story":"Fearing the prospect of a plunging pound, travellers are turning to an unlikely destination to make their money go furtherAs the wrangling over how Britain should leave the EU reaches fever pitch, one country is already experiencing a Brexit idend: Bulgaria.Resorts in the south-eastern European country have seen a surge in bookings from British holidaymakers as families seek out alternative summer destinations.Traditionally popular tourist spots in the eurozone have become pricier as the pound has slumped against the euro since the vote to leave the EU in 2016. Now families are taking action to guard against future fluctuations in the event of no deal.During the busiest holiday booking period of the year, travel agents report that more people are opting for all-inclusive deals, in effect locking in costs for food, drink and accommodation.Banks currently give about €1.11 to the pound, a sharp drop from just before the referendum, when £1 bought €1.30. In December, travellers at some UK airports were receiving only €0.90 for every £1 they changed as Brexit turmoil pushed sterling to fresh lows. Expectations are that a no-deal will result in a further drop in the value of sterling, making this summer even more expensive for anyone travelling to Europe.But Bulgaria, a low-cost destination for both sun and skiing holidays, has seen the benefit of the currency uncertainty. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said there had been an increase of almost one third in the number of holiday bookings to the country this year compared with 2018, when there had already been a rise on the previous year.“People are looking at different destinations and the length of time that they go in order to make sure that they can get the best value for money when they are being increasingly cost-conscious,” said Abta. Last weekend was one of the busiest periods of the year for travel agents as people sought to offset the January blues by booking a summer holiday. Travel agents reported strong sales despite the Brexit uncertainty, with travel firm Tui saying summer 2019 was ahead of last year.But if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal the outlook could change.Beyond the currency fluctuations, a no-deal could result in a series of administrative headaches for travellers. Abta has warned that UK-issued European health insurance cards, which allow EU citizens access to state healthcare in other EU countries, would no longer be valid. Drivers may need to apply for an international driving permit and also carry a physical card issued by their insurance company to show their cover is applicable while abroad.There would also probably be changes to the documents and health checks required for pets. Rules around roaming for mobile phones would probably change, although some companies have said they will continue to offer the same prices after a no-deal.Insecurity around the future of Brexit has also affected the housing market, with sellers and buyers sitting tight because of the uncertainty over the future. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors last month reported that the market was at its weakest level in more than six years.David Hollingworth of mortgage brokers London \u0026amp Country said the uncertainty had contributed to the slow market and that it was unlikely to change now that the new year was here, as people adopt a “wait and see” approach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08fa3a5db4edcb00dbf495fa3e5dbfb5c6799cb3/0_151_3995_2397/master/3995.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a04d46b0ec3d8dfc197fa68b23ca7f82","title":"eu brexit referendum positive case remain sadiq khan","story":"Staying in the EU gives Britain the best shot at fixing the grievances that fuelled the Brexit vote. If there’s no election, we need a referendumIt appears increasingly likely that Theresa May’s bad Brexit deal will be rejected by parliament – and rightly so. It’s a deal that would cause huge damage to the future of our country, putting jobs, prosperity and social mobility at grave risk.Tuesday’s vote is the biggest in parliament since the Iraq war – and every MP should think extremely carefully about the legacy they want to leave. I urge MPs of all political parties to put aside tribal politics and do what’s in the best interests of their constituents and the next generation.If MPs reject the deal, then Theresa May should do the responsible thing: immediately step aside and call a general election. Sadly, the Tories have a long history of putting their party above the national interest, so if an election is not immediately called, I will step up my campaign for a public vote – with the option of remaining in the EU on the ballot paper. It’s clear that if our government and parliament are incapable of finding a way out of this mess, it should be taken out of the hands of the politicians and returned to the British people to take back control and have their say.Our politics and public debate have never been as angry and ided as they are now – and some say a public vote would create yet more ision and disillusionment. I strongly disagree. A public vote would not only allow us to move beyond the current stalemate but would start the desperately needed process of healing the deep isions that have opened within our society.The blatant lies, mistruths and deceptions told by the Leave campaign during the EU referendum – which were laid bare for all to see in the Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War last week – could not be used again. And those of us arguing to remain could run a campaign full of positivity for the future – Project Hope, not Project Fear. This would mean we could finally make the optimistic case for staying in the EU as well as retaining the free movement of people – something that too many politicians have been afraid to do for generations.Back in 2016, I – along with Gordon Brown, and others – tried to make this positive, patriotic and values-based case for Britain remaining in the EU, but we were too often drowned out by negative campaigning – on both sides. If there is another public vote, we can, and must, take a very different approach – one that brings our country back together.We can run a campaign highlighting how the EU has been a force for good for generations – boosting our living standards, strengthening workers’ rights and acting as the greatest movement for peace and democracy the world has ever seen. We can remind people that our connections with Europe are a crucial part of British history – from the Polish Spitfire pilots who fought for our freedoms in the Battle of Britain to the creation of a European union being Winston Churchill’s ultimate dream. We can show people that our own history shows that the benefits of co-operation and being open to the world always eclipse the false comforts of isolation. And we can demonstrate that, when Britain takes a leadership role in Europe, our soft power and influence spreads our liberal democratic values and helps to protect human rights – both of which are more important than ever at a time of rising nationalist populism.As a country, we face major challenges because of the changing nature of our economy and society. Many people voted Leave because they felt left behind by this new world, where the benefits of economic growth increasingly flow to only a few at the top. Many were understandably looking for something, or someone, to blame – and for too long politicians and others have encouraged this and played on people’s fears, rather than addressing them.But the irony is that rather than looking inwards, being in the EU would give us the best chance of finding the solutions to many of the root causes of these grievances. So, in any new vote, we need to show that it’s only through being a proper part of Europe that we can exercise our power and influence on the world stage – allowing us to do more to ensure that all citizens share in the fruits of globalisation and to mitigate some of the consequences of societal and technological changes.Lastly, there is one group for whom this decision really matters because it’s their future that’s on the line – young people. Their voice was not properly heard during the 2016 EU referendum and this should not be allowed to happen again in such a crucial democratic decision for the future of our country. One important way to achieve this would be to reduce the voting age to 16.Europe is awash with opportunities for young Britons – whether it’s the chance to go on cultural exchange programmes, study abroad or get funding for an apprenticeship. In the next public vote, young people must be front and centre, with the message heard that remaining in the EU as a confident member can only leave a legacy of opportunities for our children, for our grandchildren and for future generations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e4a6ebfb13bda5cbb97de067666694f86715e03/0_182_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae3e4e3369c71cc7fb2ae82d8f77d885","title":"taking back control brexit seems to offer exactly the opposite","story":"Parliament is trapped in gridlock and as deeply ided as the country over Brexit, while on the streets and in the House the rancour is getting ever louderby  Toby Helm and  Nosheen IqbalTowards the end of the Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War which was broadcast last Monday evening, the leaders of the rival Remain and Leave campaigns meet in a central London bar. By coincidence Craig Oliver, David Cameron’s then director of communications, and Dominic Cummings, director of Vote Leave and inventor of the slogan “take back control”, spot one another across platforms at Moorgate tube station. They had regular rows when they worked as Tory advisers before the campaign began and have been at daggers drawn throughout it. But both are physically and emotionally exhausted as voting day approaches and – in an encounter Oliver has insisted was fictional – they agree to talk over a pint.It is shortly after the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a right-wing extremist in her West Yorkshire constituency. Oliver clearly feels things are slipping away from Remain. Sitting opposite his foe, the look on his face betrays his grim and growing realisation that Cummings is winning the war and heading for a stunning victory with unimaginable consequences for the country – albeit, he feels, by employing the basest of campaigning methods.“You’re feeding a toxic culture where the very notion of evidence-based truth is dead, where one side never believes the other, no one listens any more, we just yell,” Oliver says. Twitching a little, Cummings replies that Leave “had to yell, to be heard” and adds that the binary “in” or “out” question on which the British people would vote within days was always going to force people “into tribes”.Oliver then says his greatest fear is that the tribal isions which the campaign has already established will become permanent. “I worry it won’t heal.”Earlier on Monday, before that broadcast, ugly scenes – of exactly the kind to which Oliver had alluded in the film – were playing out outside the House of Commons. And, in this case, they were all too real.Anna Soubry, the Tory MP and Remain campaigner, was mobbed by far-right pro-Brexit campaigners who yelled that she was a “Nazi”, a “traitor” and a “fascist”. The indomitable Soubry was shaken by the hostility that Brexit had fostered. In the House of Commons there were calls for the police to do more to protect MPs caught up in the feverish atmosphere created by Brexit.“How dare he? We are talking about something that actually happened. It was clearly linked to the far right, which some of these people who are roaming outside parliament are, and he kept belittling it. This is a very present threat. It is not protest – they are thugs.”It was not just outside parliament that democracy had gone awry and turned sour. On Wednesday in the House of Commons – totally deadlocked on Brexit with just over two months to go until the UK is due to leave the EU – there was constitutional uproar.The speaker John Bercow had controversially allowed an amendment that will force Theresa May to come up with a Brexit Plan B within three days if the prime minister’s crucial meaningful vote is lost on Tuesday. On the government front bench five cabinet ministers, including May, Julian Smith, the chief whip, and the leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, sat shaking their heads in fury at Bercow.Pro-Brexit MPs shouted about “constitutional outrage” and claimed Bercow was biased. One Labour MP observed later that “anarchy had spread from outside to inside the mother of parliaments”. Rather than parliament “taking back control” – which was what Brexiters had insisted Brexit was really about – it seemed to have completely lost it.When Cameron announced in January 2013 that the British people would be able to vote in a referendum on whether the UK should stay in or leave the European Union he assumed this great exercise in democracy would settle the decades-old argument for good.“It is time for the British people to have their say,” he said at the time. “It is time to settle this European question in British politics.” Many predictions by politicians and commentators over recent years have proved wildly wide of the mark, but none, perhaps, more so than this. This weekend, two and a half years after the UK voted narrowly to leave the EU, and as Tuesday’s crucial vote on May’s Brexit deal approaches, nothing is settled at all. Divisions in Westminster and the country are deeper, wider, and more visceral than ever. Our parliament, to which Brexiters want to return sovereignty, is gridlocked and unruly to the point of paralysis. At the point when its decisions are most urgently needed, it is unable to agree on a way forward.“The political bubble has never been polarised like this before,” says Kenneth Clarke, the Conservative former minister, father of the House of Commons and a lifetime pro-European. “It’s a tragedy ... a parody of democracy.” With May facing seemingly inevitable defeat this week, Clarke, who will retire at the next election after more than five decades at the forefront of politics, cannot see a way out of an interminable mess he never imagined could develop, and fears things will get worse before they get better.On his office wall Clarke, a survivor of European arguments that scarred, and in the end did for, the premierships of Margaret Thatcher and John Major as well as Cameron, has a framed copy of a 2017 front page in which he and 14 colleagues were notoriously branded Brexit mutineers. He considers it a reminder to keep going. But he fears the current prime minister simply has no idea where she is going. “The key events now are: what is Theresa May’s reaction to this three-day deadline she’s got?,” he asks. “Will she actually tell anybody what her Plan B is, beyond her rather lightweight entourage? I would be faintly appalled if I learned she wasn’t even turning her mind on what to do.”When Soubry reflects on the wider politics and the impact on her party she, too, is scathing about May and says she has never known times so uncertain and turbulent. “It is an utterly remarkable time,” she says. She believes the prime minister is trying to force her deal through the house despite the huge risk of ending up with a no-deal Brexit that many in her own cabinet have admitted would be economically catastrophic. It is a kind of political suicide mission. “Her tactics are to run the clock down deliberately,” Soubry says. “I think she’s prepared to crash out without a deal.”But would that not spell the end of the Conservative party, and disaster for the country with it? “I agree, but she’s prepared to do it,” she says.There is one thing, however, that has brought together MPs on all sides of the Brexit ide – even Soubry and May. She reveals that the prime minister – “who I have no relationship with” – sent her a handwritten letter about the abuse against her outside the Commons.“Dear Anna,” it reads, “I hoped to see you in the House today, but I wanted to write and say how sorry I was to see the treatment you received near parliament yesterday. That was appalling and no one should be subject to such abuse.”Soubry continues to read aloud. “We all know there are differing views, often very strongly held on the European issue, but everyone should be able to put their views without the risk of intimidation and abuse. I know you are a robust person, but incidents like this are unsettling and I’m sorry you were subject to such behaviour. Yours ever, Theresa.”Despite such occasional shows of solidarity between opposing sides in parliament, arguments over Brexit are all that newer MPs have known during their times as parliamentarians. Layla Moran, the first ethnic minority Liberal Democrat MP, who has been serving the voters of Oxford west and Abingdon since 2017 and is pushing hard for a second referendum, says she’s exhausted by it all and now regards it as the norm.For her there is no respite and the fear of what may lurk outside the safe interior of the Palace of Westminster is ever present. “We’re in the situation where we’re all in campaign mode,” she says. “It feels like we’ve been on the precipice of a general election for the whole time I’ve been an MP we know we’re in the middle of a moment of history that will be written about, but not knowing what happens next is making it really tense and emotional.” She fears for her safety and that of others. “They’re bruisy men out there. You’d cross the road at night if you saw them.”Outside parliament the yelling from both sides of the Brexit argument continues. In recent weeks dozens have lined up with banners, flags and placards by mid-afternoon every day. The activity ramped up in the weeks before Christmas. “That’s when the yellow jacket lot first came,” confirms a policeman outside Black Rod’s garden last week.Has it made his job much harder? “Well it’s not got easier,” he sighs in the cold. Behind him, and dotted in pairs across Westminster, at almost every entrance and gate, are police armed with machine guns.Andy Curzon, an engineer from Manchester, finds it “crazy that many people, including MPs, are incapable of understanding the basic facts of trade and that we’re going to sever these links.”He waves an EU flag next to a sign for passing cars that reads “TOOT TO STOP BREXIT”. Asked whether he has talked to any of the Leave protesters today, Curzon sighs. “You try but ... nationalism now is just crackers – I can’t understand why people want it. We all have phones. We’re all connected and have friends and family all over the world.”Two male Ukip protesters, who won’t share their names, blame “fake news”, under which they classify all major media, with no exceptions. “Leave means leave. We’re not unreasonable,” insists the younger man, dressed in a parka and blue jeans. He describes himself as “a citizen journalist from southwest London”. About the Soubry incident, he is flippant: “This is a Westminster bubble, that’s how people talk in the pub. Get used to it. There is no such thing as hate speech, it’s just different opinions. I find your paper offensive. I won’t shut you down or get you arrested.”On the street, the man still bellowing a full-throated “out means out” is enraged by a host of conspiracy theories he believes in. “I find news the way I need to find it,” he says when asked about his information. “I research people that I get it off. If I can get it from a family member then that’s it. If you were on my side, you’d be doing all that.”The country should prepare for riots, he says. “They can’t expect the people to be law-abiding citizens when government is as corrupt as it is. All them people in here,” he claims, “are getting paid backhanders all the way through the system.”The British public is now more ided, more aware and more conscious of who is on which side of the argument at the heart of British public life. Politicians, communities, families are – 31 months on from the vote – unable to come together and seem largely immune to persuasion, unbiddable and unwilling to budge from entrenched positions. The country stands just 75 days away from the supposed moment of Brexit but with no national or political consensus over what Brexit should entail, or whether it should go ahead at all.Deadlock in parliament reflects ision in the country. “Brexit has paralysed the democratic system,” says a senior Tory MP. “And the really alarming thing is I cannot see how this does not endure for decades. We will all be defined as Remainers or Leavers for decades to come. This is not a passing argument. It really is close to civil war.”Normal alliances have broken down, and parties have split many ways, raising questions about whether Brexit will deliver a new political alignment, in the form of new party in the centre and at the extremes. “The real legacy of Brexit could be a completely different British politics and party system,” says a Labour frontbencher.Cameron’s referendum has left the Conservative party split between hard Brexiters, soft Brexiters, and Remainers, while Labour, although its membership and supporters are overwhelmingly pro-Remain, has its own deep ides.Its leader Jeremy Corbyn seems unwilling to commit to what most of his party wants – a second referendum – because he is a lifelong Eurosceptic. Labour has staggered through the last two and half years with a policy of deliberate ambiguity in order to offend the fewest possible of its supporters.Outside the party system, there are two broad camps, fairly evenly split, if the polls are to be believed. On the one side are those who believe that because the country voted for Brexit it must go ahead with it – either because they think it is a good thing instrinsically or that not to do so would be dangerous for democracy, or both. In the other camp are those who believe that we should find a way out of activating Article 50 and stay in, perhaps by holding a second referendum with Remain on the ballot paper or by simply cancelling the whole project.Prominent supporters of both sides have been turning up the rhetoric before next week’s vote in the hope of winning the day. Yesterday the pro-Brexit cabinet minister Chris Grayling said blocking Brexit could end the 350 years of “moderate” politics that Britain has enjoyed since the English civil war. Last week leading businesses, including Jaguar, Land Rover and Ford, warned of job losses, while Greg Clark, the business secretary, said a no-deal Brexit would be economically “disastrous”. This week, the Brexit saga and uncertainty will enter another phase.What will happen if May’s deal is voted down – as it almost certainly will be – nobody knows. Downing Street is determined to press ahead with the vote, although it is aware that the prime minister is facing a massive defeat – another indication of how impossible her position has become. What then?“We could head for a no-deal Brexit, but Parliament voted last week to block that option off as it would be catastrophic,” says a senior Tory MP. “We could have a second referendum to sort out the mess, but there is no sign of a parliamentary majority for that either. So God only knows.”Outside the Commons the protests go on. “This is civil war without the muskets,” says Helen Slater, who has come from Bristol to campaign. “It is appalling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b0c6c55e513456761118f611f5c0cf77be3e937/0_57_2506_1504/master/2506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6125b411769dc5b623360d0215e0add","title":"theresa may rejecting brexit deal would be unforgivable breach of trust","story":"Transport secretary defends May’s stance amid reports of ‘plots’ by MPs to take control Chris Grayling has denied there is a “void” in government over Brexit amid a series of reports about supposed plots by MPs to take control of the process.But the transport secretary repeatedly refused to say what Theresa May would do if her plan is defeated next week.With the prime minister arguing it would be a “catastrophic and unforgivable breach of trust” for MPs to vote down her proposals on Tuesday, Grayling, one of May’s key allies, insisted there was a coherent plan B.“I don’t think it is a void at all,” he told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. “The government’s coming forward with a proposal for the nation, to parliament, which says, this is what we think is the best compromise deal that enables us to leave.“It does so in a way that recognises that the nation is pretty ided on this issue.”But Grayling refused to say what might happen if, as widely expected, MPs vote heavily against May’s plan.“Let’s cross that bridge if and when it happens,” he said. “Right now her focus, my focus, the government’s focus is on convincing people that actually this is the best thing to do, it’s the right option. It’s the most likely to deliver Brexit.”Pressed again on whether a backup plan even existed, Grayling added: “I’m not going to get into will we do this, will we do that, will we do the other. The important thing is to say to fellow MPs: those concerns are out there, and they’re big concerns.”Two days ahead of the vote, May wrote in the Sunday Express that the Commons would face the “biggest and most important decision that any MP of our generation will be asked to make”.“When you turned out to vote in the referendum, you did so because you wanted your voice to be heard. Some of you put your trust in the political process for the first time in decades. We cannot – and must not – let you down.“Doing so would be a catastrophic and unforgivable breach of trust in our democracy. So my message to parliament this weekend is simple: it is time to forget the games and do what is right for our country.”Her plea comes ahead of a likely tumultuous week for May and her government, as speculation swirls about the plans of backbench MPs to further wrest control of the process away from the prime minister.Last week, an amendment led by the Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve was controversially allowed through for a vote by the Speaker, John Bercow. It means May must present a new Brexit proposal within three working days if her plan is defeated.Reports in several newspapers said Grieve held talks with Bercow ahead of the Speaker’s decision, with the Sunday Times talking of a “very British coup” by anti-Brexit backbenchers to thwart the process.This idea was dismissed by the remain-backing Conservative MP Anna Soubry, who tweeted that the idea of a coup was a “nasty smear” encouraged by Downing Street.Asked about the idea of a plot by backbench MPs, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, argued that there was a real chance it could stop the departure process.Recent events in the Commons had shown “that the uncertainty in terms of what will happen in the house has increased”, he told BBC One’s Andrew Marr show.“So those on the Brexiteer side seeking ideological purity with a deal are risking Brexit, because there is a growing risk that events could unfold in ways that mean they are leaving the door ajar to ways that increase the risk to Brexit.”In his interview, Grayling reiterated his warning that stopping Brexit could boost the far right, a view which prompted condemnation on Saturday.“My concern is that we will have, in the aftermath of a decision not to go ahead with Brexit, what we will have is the arrival in this country of the kind of populist politics on the extremes that we are seeing in most other European countries,” Grayling said.“I do not want that, the emergence of the populist parties that were are seeing in most European countries now, in this country, because we’ve turned round to the 17.4 million people who voted to leave and simply said to them: ‘Look guys, sorry, we’re not leaving after all.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c461e11d1e9f2cfe279fc1d1d9cbceac898a572/0_82_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b5ed3df6d925d7904c67c81e6e1452e","title":"nick kyrgios andy murray australian open tennis","story":"The Australian tennis player pays tribute to the opponent with whom he formed the closest of bonds off the courtWe just had a lot of banter between each other.

We knew when we were together it was going to be a lot of fun and a lot of banter and some good vibes. He’s hilarious, he’s so funny.His tennis gets enough recognition. He was an unbelievable player. He was one of the toughest people I ever played against. But I don’t think he gets enough credit for how he was off the court, just as a normal person.

That’s how difficult it was.”If the former world No 1’s match against the Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open on Monday is his last public appearance on a tennis court – as he fears it might be – he will leave to rapturous applause and the gratitude of a generation. Despite beating Agut in their three previous matches, Murray does not expect to win.The Scot said he was determined to follow advice from psychologists and delay making decisions about what he does next.“I don’t want to stop playing tennis just now,” he admitted. “I don’t feel ready, the rest of my body feels perfect.“That’s the hard thing about it. It’s not like I wake up and my whole body’s sore, and just aching, and it’s too much. It’s just one problem that can’t be fixed. That’s why it’s difficult. Look, lots of things have been weird. Like, the US Open last year for me was quite odd, because I was in a lot of pain.”There he lost to Fernando Verdasco in the second round. He lost to him again in Shenzhen – and that was it for 2018 – 12 matches, seven defeats and nothing to show for it but a seemingly ineradicable limp and dwindling hopes after 15 years as a professional.“I know I’ve got no chance of winning this tournament and most likely I’m going to lose in the first round. I’m not happy about that. Because of the way the last six months of competing have gone, I could win but it’s likely that I won’t. It’s going to be uncomfortable,” he said.“If it is my last match, I want to try and enjoy it – enjoy the whole experience, which is maybe something during my career that I’ve not done. I’ve always been focused on tactics and winning and finding a way that’s been the most important thing.”What Murray wants to do after spending nearly his entire life playing tennis is to have some fun, play five-a-side with his mates, and fit in some golf – which might have been his chosen sport, if his father, Willie, had had his way, rather than his mother, Judy, who steered him towards tennis.He could have been a footballer. But tennis, with its inbuilt frustrations and challenges, its quirks of scoring and circumstances, suited his mercurial rhythm. It gave him a canvas on which to paint his particular art. Few did it more artfully. Manufacturing a graceful departure has not been easy, though.“Coming in here, my mindset is… it feels very different. Like, the other day, I was saying to my team: ‘The thing that’s difficult – because I’m not practising anywhere near as much as I used to – is I can’t just go back on the practice court and work on my serve or whatever I’m not happy with – I can’t do that any more.’“But it’s interesting because once I’d started thinking about stopping, that there was a possibility that I wasn’t going to be playing much longer, all of the things that I thought I would quite like to do, I have zero interest in doing right now.“I have no motivation to do anything else just now. Thinking about what I do when I finish playing and rushing into decisions – from speaking to psychologists – is the worst thing I should be doing. It’s going to take time for me to deal with it. I need time to get over it and then to know what my next steps are going to be.“I know that will be difficult. I love tennis. I love playing the game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/193b28953ace1ecf4ddceab6f9ad83635f170710/150_628_6419_3852/master/6419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b1a475b54f6aacb826ecff73cf00b6c","title":"zak hardaker wigan super league rugby league","story":"It is a crisp January morning at Wigan’s training ground and Zak Hardaker is in his “happy place”. The 27-year-old has come in on his day off for kicking drills, preparing for his Warriors debut in a pre-season friendly at Salford next Sunday and as he sits down he tries to remember the last time we conducted an interview together.It was September 2017 and a lot has happened since then. Hardaker is one of the most talented players of his generation, winning three Super League titles by the age of 24, but he has not played for 16 months after news broke of a positive test for cocaine, while playing for Castleford, days before their first Grand Final appearance. Unfortunately that is not where the controversy ends.They say history has a habit of repeating itself and Hardaker can testify to that. After it was announced last summer that Wigan would give him the chance to resurrect his career, he was arrested and given a 20-month ban behind the wheel for drink-driving. That was the latest in a number of high-profile misdemeanours that have overshadowed his career, including being investigated by the police over an assault and receiving a five-match suspension for homophobic abuse.“I was locked up overnight for 12 hours when I got arrested and after realising I wasn’t going to be able to sleep I was staring at those empty white walls and wondered if this was it,” Hardaker says. “Wigan had given me a chance I may not have deserved in truth and I’d let them down. But they made it clear what I needed to do to save my career.”Hardaker is not foolish enough to believe his apologies mean a lot by now, given the number of controversies he has been embroiled in and last chances he has been handed. Many expected Wigan to tear up his five-year contract. Instead they stuck with him.“It was genuinely 50-50 whether we cut our losses at that point,” says Wigan’s director of rugby, Kris Radlinski, Hardaker’s childhood idol. “We had a harsh meeting with him and explained he had some hurdles to clear to prove he belonged at this club.”“I’d reached a moment where me and my family realised I needed to do something to change my life, not just my career. You think you know all about yourself but when you’re in a place like that, it teaches you to reassess. I’ve apologised so many times before but I didn’t know how to handle it when things went wrong. I had to accept I needed help, which was a big ask for a 27-year‑old, but I needed to.”For 26 days, rugby – and the distractions of home life – were off the agenda. “It’s six hours away and it was about tackling your issues head-on rather than shrugging them off. “I was lucky to be offered that chance and Wigan rang me every day, assuring me I had a future if I did the right things. I know people will struggle to believe this but I’m sick of making the same mistakes. I’ve learned a lot about myself in Sporting Chance.”Aside from his issues with alcohol and his high-profile drugs suspension, Hardaker has been fighting another battle: a lifelong struggle with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, though he stresses it is not the root of all his wrongdoings. “Male mental health is very topical right now but I’ve always been keen for my ADHD to be private, so it doesn’t look like an excuse.“I couldn’t have sugary drinks or sweets when I was younger because of it, I had to do all sorts of unusual stuff and it’s important people know that’s a daily battle for me – but not while saying: ‘This is why I’ve done what I’ve done in the past.’ It was 2016 when I knew it was becoming a real problem but I just tried to pretend it wasn’t there. It’s been difficult to live with at times.”After leaving the clinic and resuming training with Wigan Hardaker began the process of moving away from his hometown of Pontefract for the first time. He believes that has also been crucial for his rehabilitation. “Being able to concentrate solely on rugby was why it was time to move,” he says. “At home there were too many distractions to lead me astray. I’m now in a town where rugby league is everything and the expectations of the people are huge.”Hardaker says he has not touched alcohol since the night he was arrested last September but for those who have followed his career, it is hard not to feel this has all been heard before. Does he accept it will be difficult to earn back the trust of the sport when his playing career resumes, with some arguing he has already had too many chances?“I sincerely apologise for my actions and know it might take another five years for me to not do anything stupid, and people might think I’ve turned a corner. Life now feels a lot clearer armed with what I learned at Sporting Chance. Previously, on days off, I’d be sat around wondering what to do and it would normally end in me losing my head or going to the pub. But now I’m much better prepared to deal with it.”Hardaker acknowledges the fierce public backlash his actions have provoked: “Some comments I get on social media are very difficult to deal with and I’ve stopped using Twitter because it’s brutal.”One thing is clear: the former Man of Steel is itching to lay this latest tumultuous chapter of his career to rest by returning to rugby for good. “I’d be in a cell again if it went wrong one more time,” he says. “It wouldn’t end well if rugby wasn’t there for me because of my own mistakes.“September 25th was a defining moment in my life and there were times during the suspension when I wondered if packing rugby in would make all my problems go away. But I’m back with a smile on my face, I’ve found a way to deal with my problems for the first time and I’m hungry to play. No more bad headlines, only good ones.”Radlinski says: “It’s early days but he’s cleared a big hurdle with Sporting Chance. We want to be part of this journey with him and we think he can be the best player in the competition again – but it’s up to him and nobody else now.”“It’ll all make a good book one day,” Hardaker says with a smile as the end of our hour together nears. With the full-back now in his happy place once again, perhaps there could still be a good ending to this story. But only Hardaker can write the remaining chapters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f195ac5c5b6872f5c38e46309d7b2bd20132f0e4/0_340_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9470efba81373387a2622d8a43aaa489","title":"chris boardman cycle road plan manchester","story":"The former Olympic champion hopes to win a different race, all for the public good and improving transport options for allIt is a Sherlock Holmes evening in south Manchester. There is a deep fog on an already black night, perfect for tail-coated villains to dart between the wheelie bins. But in a primary school hall the lights are on and a public meeting is taking place about a proposed local cycle route. There are a couple of councillors, engineers, 180 or so members of the public – the irate and the enthusiastic – and a world-record breaking and Olympic winning cyclist: Chris Boardman.The microphone does not work, there are tetchy complaints about a phone vote and low-level tension plonks down in the corner. Boardman, here in his role as Manchester’s cycling and walking tsar seems unfazed. He perches on the table, sticks a hand in his pocket and starts to speak. He is confident, blunt – and hackles visibly settle.It is all a long way from Lycra-clad time trials. Boardman, 50 and who in 1994 became only the second British cyclist to wear the Tour de France’s yellow jersey, retired from cycling in 2000 with the aim of doing “sod all”. He and his wife had scaled their life down and Boardman was able to pick and choose jobs – before being sucked back in 2004 when asked to help a couple of coaches with “some problematic athletes” – including Bradley Wiggins. He then became head of British Cycling’s Secret Squirrel Club – in charge of research and development – for the next two Olympics. He set up his own bike company and did TV commentary.But it is this new role that has him up at night. “It’s the only thing in 20 years to do that because it’s important,” he says, earlier the same day, in a living room round the corner from the Co-op. “People say do you enjoy it? No! I just feel this massive burden not to screw it up.”Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, aims to turn the city into one of the greenest in Europe, and a place of mostly haphazard, sometime pot-holed cycle lanes, into the cycling capital of the country with 1,000 miles of network. Boardman has been given 10 years and £1.5bn of ringfenced money.He is confident he can change behaviour in this rainy city, where there are 250 million car journeys of less than 1km every year, where life expectancy is among the lowest in the country, where air pollution is too high, where people eat, drink and smoke too much and do not do enough exercise. It is also the first place in the world where Mobike, the Chinese cycle-sharing operator, withdrew because of antisocial behaviour. But Boardman sees only potential.“I enjoy talking about this because it has absolutely nothing to do with cyclists. They might benefit but this is for people who drive because they’re the ones who are going to want to change if it’s going to work.”His criteria for success: doubling and doubling again cycling in Greater Manchester. Walking routes with space enough for a double buggy, a cycle network that can be handled by competent 12-year-olds and be trusted by their parents. His secret weapons: democracy, letting local communities plot their own routes, a joined-up network including, critically, junctions and “telling people if you don’t want to do it, we won’t do it. Then people say: ‘Oh, we do’, and you’ve got a proper conversation on your hands.”Boardman is no fanatic. He has two cars and spends lots of time on the M6, journeying from the Wirral, where he has lived most of his life. Nor was he a massive advocate for public cycling in his professional years. “It’s a very self-centred existence being an athlete. You’re incredibly selfish and encouraged to be so,” he admits.“People think the Netherlands have always been about bikes but they haven’t. In the 1970s, because of child deaths on the streets and a looming oil crisis, they said: stop. They decided to change the way they used streets and put people first. Their spend went into public transport. They’ve got a higher tax rate than we have but it is wonderfully civilised. We invested in private transport. We’re not unusual, we just do the easy thing – and the car has always been easy until there’s so many of them that it’s not, and the consequences are becoming more and more apparent.”Boardman’s mother, Carol, was killed in a cycling accident in July 2016. Last month Liam Rosney admitted causing death by careless driving. “It’s just horrifically ironic,” Boardman says. “I can’t think about it because it would just destroy me. It’s not just taking away someone’s life. It’s everything that’s left behind. And we don’t treat it as a crime. We say: ‘Oh, what a shame.’” He sighs.“This, this is the biggest race I’ve ever had. If we can change something as big as a city region and prove that it works, you have to believe the rest of the country will follow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65df9e17f4903f60225e464f0258296f8377593f/0_238_4203_2522/master/4203.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef88d72cdf752285721e01ff46152251","title":"coming clean review trafalgar studios london kevin elyot gay love triangle","story":"Trafalgar Studios, LondonSexual freedom and emotional commitment clash in Kevin Elyot’s debut exploring sexual deception in a gay relationship Kevin Elyot will always be remembered for My Night With Reg. However, Coming Clean, first seen at the Bush in 1982 and now transferred to the West End in a King’s Head revival, marked his debut and reveals his capacity to explore different aspects of gay culture while exploiting the standard tropes of domestic drama. The fit is nothing like as perfect as in his later work but, as this production reminds us, the promise is palpably there.It is significant that the play first appeared in the same year as The Real Thing. Although nothing like as structurally ingenious as Tom Stoppard’s play, it deals with the same subject: the pain of infidelity. Tony, an aspiring writer, and Greg, an American academic, have settled into a comfortable, quasi-monogamous relationship after cohabiting for five years. Their lives are disrupted when they hire a young cleaner, an out-of-work actor named Robert. His every move seems to infuriate Greg, whose jokes he tactlessly caps during a disastrous dinner party, while Tony shamelessly flirts with this Adonis-like houseboy. Unsurprisingly, it is Robert who drives a wedge between the long-term lovers.Elyot frequently falls back on the stock devices of the traditional West End play. One of the lovers unexpectedly returns from a weekend away to discover his partner in flagrante. Elyot also introduces a flamboyant neighbour, William, whose purpose seems to be to provide comic relief – until he gets beaten up by a piece of rough trade. But what Elyot captures well is the contest between emotional commitment and sexual freedom. He suggests that Tony and Greg, while enjoying one-night stands, are bound together by custom, shared interests and unspoken love: the realisation that one of them has been engaged in a long-term affair poignantly reveals the mix of hurt, wounded pride and social embarrassment prompted by betrayal.Adam Spreadbury-Maher’s production rightly preserves the play’s period feel: this is not only a pre-Aids world, but one where a pint of beer costs 90p and you can get a return rail fare for £14.60. Amanda Mascarenhas’s design also catches the shabby quality of a Kentish Town flat decorated by a faded portrait of the Queen Mum and with wine stains embedded in the carpet.The performances are mostly good. Lee Knight is outstanding as Tony, showing how his behaviour shifts according to the company he is in: with his lover, Greg, he is all devoted sobriety, whereas with his outrageous friend, William, he acquires a veneer of head-tossing camp. Stanton Plummer-Cambridge also lends Greg the right work-orientated earnestness, and it’s more Elyot’s fault than his that it’s hard to credit that the character has enjoyed half the gay men in London. Tom Lambert, resembling a young Michael York, pins down the cleaner’s mix of calculation and sensuality, and Elliot Hadley, at one point enthusiastically gobbling a cream eclair, never knowingly underacts as the next-door disco-queen.Later plays such as The Inheritance and Angels in America have offered a more comprehensive view of gay relationships. But Elyot, as far as Britain goes, was a pioneer in the field, and his debut play shows that, whatever your orientation, few things are more devastating than sexual deception."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d871546f38211363e636a798673f4472a804f969/0_78_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c040baaf4f2320a76267e73874f60659","title":"kwame kwei armah soon gone windrush chronicle tribute to parents","story":"A long-held wish to bring the story of the Windrush generation and its descendants to a wider audience has come true for a leading director. But as Kwame Kwei-Armah’s dramatic tribute – a series of televised monologues that will feature leading black actors including Lenny Henry – is announced this weekend, he is coming to terms with the death of his father a few days ago.The eight 15-minute films overseen by the director, Soon Gone: A Windrush Chronicle, are part of a ersity-themed season that runs on BBC Four next month, and were made for the channel by Henry’s production company, Douglas Road, in collaboration with Kwei-Armah’s London theatre, the Young Vic. They tell the chronological saga of a Caribbean family’s arrival in Britain in 1948 and chart its progress down the decades, eventually projecting into the future.“The central provocation behind the idea was to wonder if this community will survive,” Kwei-Armah said. “We are at a particularly significant moment in history and this story has been sitting in my conscience.”The former Casualty actor believes drama is the way to communicate the different social landscape of the past. “I wanted to show that what people take for granted today was not always the case. Lenny and I have said to each other we are both in the legacy business now. So it is part of our responsibility as artists to tell these stories.”The writer, who made his name with the play Elmina’s Kitchen in 2003, spent seven years running Baltimore’s Center Stage theatre, which gave him a valuable lesson as an immigrant. “I realised it is hard work. There are things I couldn’t say, that Americans could, because from me it would sound like criticism.”The monologues have been written by different people, including the award-winning playwright Roy Williams, and tackle immigration and integration, as well as making reference to the Windrush scandal, which brought to light the uncertain citizenship of many who had lived, worked and paid taxes in Britain for decades.“We were mindful of not making it only a response to the Windrush scandal, but characters do refer to it. They also refer to other big issues, such as the Stephen Lawrence murder in the 1990s and the emergence of the hip-hop scene,” Kwei-Armah said.The 51-year-old director grew up in Southall, south-west London, with the name Ian Roberts. After watching the television series Roots, about slavery, he told his mother he would trace his family and take an African name.At 19, while reading an autobiography of Malcolm X, he carried out this plan to reclaim his ancestral past, tracing his Ghanaian family tree back to the slave fort his great-great-great-grandfather was taken from.In London, his father, Eric Roberts, worked at the local Quaker Oats factory. His mother, a nurse, took work as a hairdresser and a childminder to pay her son’s fees at stage school.Jonty Claypole, the BBC’s head of arts, said the project is the first such collaboration with a theatre and external production team. “It was implicit from the start we would have a black cast and crew. This seemed like something television could do to mark the Windrush era.”Other programmes in the season announced today by Claypole include a partnership with the Phoenix dance theatre, A Very British History, a factual series, and a documentary about photographer Don McCullin’s travels across Britain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e5a1c12521a64d3cea857c1fac9bf31f03c908/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11d5f2a567295cadb85321cfe3f9b4cb 700w","title":"the ultimate vegan friday night feast","story":"You’ve made it through the week, and now you want to celebrate with some good food. Vegan Miranda Larbi shares her tips for creating an indulgent Veganuary feastThere really is nothing quite as wonderful as logging off at 5pm on a Friday knowing that you’ve got no plans or dates with anyone except your sofa and Netflix.Back in the day, you may have thought that anything short of spending Saturday with a banging hangover was an abject failure but, in these busy times of hyper-connectivity, having a little down time during peak socialising hours can be seen as the ultimate luxury.And it’s especially welcome if you’re taking part in Veganuary. After all, the best way to kick a habit is to simply not engage. So rather than dining out and being tempted by a plate of ribs or raclette, you’re much better off staying in with a truckload of vegan treats.For me, that tends to involve a three-course feast of simple but delicious goodies.First up, non-dairy cheese (just because you’re a vegan, it doesn’t mean you can’t still have a cheese-fest).Cicioni cheese is incredible. It’s made from cashews, almonds, salt and water and tastes like goat’s cheese. Slice some up, stick it on a plate of Kallo rice cakes with some spicy chutney on top and you’re golden.And if that’s not enough cheese for you, there are always more options.A classic wintry pass-the-elasticated-joggers dish is mac and cheese, and I have a vegan version that will send you into the most glorious of carb comas. My recipe is both delicious and nutritious. It’s rich in vitamin B12 (notoriously hard to get from a plant-based diet) and has good fats. Here’s what you’ll need …Mac and cheeseSoak your cashews for a couple of hours (I tend to leave them soaking when I go to work) and, once swollen, throw into your food processor along with a glug of olive oil, a pinch of salt, the lemon juice, garlic and a generous dose of the nutritional yeast. The more yeast, the stronger the cheese flavour.Next, cook your pasta.In a separate pan, fry your onion and garlic before adding your chopped chestnut mushrooms and kale. Give the mushrooms a chance to brown a little and then once they look done, add your torn-up spinach and mix into your drained pasta. Drench in the sauce and sprinkle extra yeast on top. If you have any of the Cicioni cheese left, crumble some over.Obviously it’s not an indulgent night in without pudding …Nothing beats a tub of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s to kick back with on a Friday night. Vegan Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is the only plant-based ice-cream I’ve tried that tastes as decadent as the dairy version – in fact, I don’t think I’d be able to tell the difference.Want to make it even more indulgent? Then I suggest throwing a packet of Livia’s Kitchen Nugglets Raw Cookie Dough into the mix (this is especially good with Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice-cream).Livia has some fantastically simple recipes (all vegan, gluten-free) on its website that are worth giving a go. I made an indulgent chocolate pie a couple of weekends ago, which was perfection personified with a dollop of ice-cream on top. I did have to lie down afterwards to deal with the sugar rush, but it was more than worth it.If you do Friday nights in right (more food, less boozing), you may even find that you’re curiously light on your feet and awake enough to make it to your 9am yoga class the next morning.See, Veganuary could be just the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bc71bface7ef6903bde9854f48c8988b922630/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f948dcdbaf8026e4e43892e7df17b71a","title":"theres never been a better time to be vegan","story":"With restaurants, chefs and well-known brands introducing more vegan options than ever, sticking to a plant-based diet is now both simple and indulgent, says Club Mexicana’s Meriel Armitage A decade ago, when I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons, the word “decadent” was one you’d never have used to describe the food available. More often than not, it fitted the joyless stereotype of lentils, quinoa and tofu, with the occasional Linda McCartney vegan sausage to liven things up. Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus. Supermarkets now stock an amazing range of vegan food that’s expanding all the time. Brands, such as Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, are constantly bringing out new vegan products that are causing a buzz outside, as well as inside, the vegan world.There’s never been a better time to be vegan, or just to introduce more plant-based alternatives into your everyday diet. With so many amazing colours, textures and flavours on offer, you never need to feel you’re depriving yourself of the food you love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45c72d5042cf63ee2c720d714238911f247a7e26/0_373_5597_3358/master/5597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4b8aac52d5ac3a0c96c1d44a7f8009e","title":"the ultimate vegan baked alaska recipe","story":"This indulgent, retro dessert just got a vegan makeover, thanks to non-dairy ice-cream and aquafaba meringueServes 8Prep: 1 hour 20 minutes, plus 4-5 hours for freezingCook: 25-30 minutesFor the cake:125g dairy-free baking spread150ml dairy-free milk2 tsp white wine vinegar125g caster sugar1 tsp vanilla extract175g self-raising flour1 tsp baking powderFor the filling:500ml tub Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s non-dairy ice-cream3 tbsp jamFor the meringue:1 x 400g can chickpeas1⁄4 tsp xanthan gum1⁄4 tsp cream of tartar1 tsp vanilla extract100g caster sugarPreheat the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4.

And the crown of its electric hybrid vehicles is the OutlanderFor boy racers and speed queens who came of age in the 90s, Mitsubishi was synonymous with one thing: wheel-smoking acceleration of such abrupt intensity that it was like strapping your innards to a firework. The model in question was the Lancer Evolution, known to all as the Evo. It was a bland-looking saloon, but it packed a phenomenal turbo-charged engine beneath the shell of its innocuous bonnet. What I loved about it was its below-the-radar appeal. It had a coy “Who me?” innocence, which added to its subversion. You had to be in the know to appreciate its power. There were clues, of course: the huge rear wing, the gaping air intake and the infamous FQ variant – the “FQ” standing for “Frigging Quick.”Mitsubishi has made a habit of springing the unexpected on us. I’m not sure many would guess that the bestselling plug-in hybrid vehicle in Europe and the best-selling plug-in (hybrid or full-electric) for the past three years in Britain is a Mitsubishi. Not a Nissan, not a Toyota, not a Renault, but a rather ordinary looking SUV called an Outlander PHEV (which stands for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle). It doesn’t look futuristic. It does a very good job at being virtually anonymous. But the PHEV performs an astonishing conjuring trick. It can be driven by its naturally aspirated 2.4-litre petrol engine, or by its electric motors powered by batteries alone, or by a combination of the two. Its batteries can be charged on the move or the car can be plugged into the mains. It can cruise on electric power alone at up to 84mph – however, the range on pure electric is only 28 miles. That option has been designed for users who do short, daily, urban journeys. If your office commute is around 25 miles, you could in theory drive to work, recharge and drive home, without burning a single drop of petrol.For longer journeys, you’ll need to use a combination. You don’t need to make these judgements yourself: the onboard computer is more than happy to choose which mode is most appropriate without being asked.The car is an SUV, which is a super useful body style: it’s one we Britons can’t get enough of. There isn’t a carmaker today who isn’t rushing to get an SUV on to its books. The fact that you can now have a roomy five-seater with a spacious boot that is also kinder to our planet means you will have so much reason to feel smug, you might even get sick of yourself.The new Outlander looks pretty much the same as the old one – students of car design will spot the revised LED headlights. But this isn’t a car that has ever traded on its looks: customers like it as it is. Inside it’s comfortable and well laid out. It makes a virtue of practicality. To drive, it’s almost unsettlingly smooth. It couldn’t be more different to the smoke and fire of Mitsubishi’s Evo. If the Evo was a young person’s car, the Outlander is definitely one for the mature motorist – and as I drifted peacefully along the M4 en route to visit the grandparents for Sunday lunch, I couldn’t have felt happier driving one.Email Martin at martin.love@observer or follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1991c731c430ba23ac3572344d36767a57d9d600/0_614_5052_3032/master/5052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffe8dc74330be208d64eb92a278e805a","title":"25 holidays retreats to reboot your life yoga surfing pool spas","story":"From yoga to surfing to pool therapy, Yorkshire to Sardinia to Poland, find yourself on an amazing retreatby  Joanne O\u0027Connor,  Eva Wiseman,  Genevieve Fox,  Séamas O’Reilly and  Harriet GreenEva Wiseman visits a traditional ‘wellness island’ reinvented for the 21st-century travellerWhat is a holiday for? Once, I would have confidently said: “For a break from work”, or if I was being paid by the word, “For reading bestsellers, in the sun, slightly drunk on local wine and weather, in a bikini and area of patchy phone reception, just bad enough that you have no choice but to fall behind on world news.”But it has become clear that the point of a holiday is a fluid and changeable thing, a thing that tells us much about our seasonal anxieties and spiritual ambitions. Consider for instance the inner workings of the period when a holiday was about “travel”, about journeying and exploring, broadening our minds through a long plane ride to somewhere hot. Or the focus on “eco-tourism”, where tourists were encouraged to believe they were saving the world by camping.It is for this reason that I’m sweating on a six-seater plane with my family, juddering over the Adriatic and pretending to our four-year-old that everything is completely, totally fine. Until now, the island of Lošinj in Croatia has been accessible to many only via a five-hour road and ferry trip from Zagreb, so it’s remained a holiday destination for tourists driving from Hungary or Germany. But this year the scattered five-star hotels have started chartering these tiny, terrifying flights to bring a wealthier clientele from Russia and the UK, people attracted by its historic “wellness” credentials.In the late 1800s, after Croatian botanist Ambroz Haračić helped reforest this previously rocky port, the Austro-Hungarian government declared Lošinj a health resort. Today, having dusted off the title “wellness island”, Lošinj is welcoming a new influx of tourists visiting to enjoy air quality so pure (a combination of salt-spray from the sea, hundreds of thousands of Aleppo pines, and a unique geographical micro-climate) it’s been proven to improve lung health. That and the blue water, the heat, and its relative affordability. Typically, visitors have rented mobile homes or stayed on the campsites, all of which are metres from a stony beach, and most of which have their own massage facilities – health drills deep here, wellness is not just for the wealthy. But one draw of the newly renovated luxury hotels is the scale of their offerings, vast modern spas, air-conditioned to a gentle chill. We are greeted at the Bellevue, its midcentury furniture suggesting a dozen new ways to relax, with the coldest glasses of water I’ve ever tasted.The spa here stretches across the basement of the white 1960s hotel – one end is dark-walled and soothing, with colour therapy and steam rooms, the other clinical and spare, offering Botox and cryotherapy.After checking in I walk through the piped music of its hallway, be-robed and dazed – perhaps it’s the Lošinj air or perhaps the flight, but I feel almost medicated, floating.The island is only 21 miles long and just under three miles wide – a coastal path wraps around the bay of Čikat, and a guide walks us along it into a forest to pick herbs and plants, which we take back to the spa to blend and distil into a balm. It smells like the island, a rich green scent which follows us as we trot around the cove that evening to a fish restaurant, Konoba Cigale, where the proximity to Venice shows in the menu – they stuff their homemade pasta with seafood caught that morning. Again, that blissful feeling overwhelmed me as our daughter danced to the accordion player and my partner and I looked at each other over our Istrian wine with a sort of stunned disbelief at the glory of it all, at the possibility of a holiday that feels like the photos.Morning came with birdsong. But, a moment here to discuss the breakfast buffet. Too often, I think, hotel guests become jaded by the intense joy delivered to them daily – this, too, is a side-effect of the holiday experience. A couple of days in and you no longer marvel at the blueness of the sea or the blueness of the sky, or the crisp affordability of the local wine, or, in the case of Lošinj, the smell, that leafy smell of health and wellness. But if you are four years old and enjoying your first hotel, the breakfast buffet in a grand lobby is by far the most exciting element of any holiday, and remains so every time you emerge from the lift, into this oasis of omelettes and fruit. For the stressed and old, wellness is a simplifying of one’s polluted urban life for children, it’s cake for breakfast.A freeer ferried us on a speedboat around the bay, stopping to show us secluded caves where we could swim, eventually pulling up to a restaurant on the shore of the tiny car-free island of Ilovik. On the way back, our daughter slept by the engine of the boat in a nest of towels.There was much we didn’t do. We didn’t visit the Museum of Apoxyomenos in the town of Mali Lošinj, which boasts a single exhibit – a Greek bronze statue of an athlete dating from the 1st century, found in the sea. We didn’t cycle into the forests, or see a dolphin, or stumble into the naturist colony. We did, however, eat ice cream in the island’s two fishing villages, Veli Lošinj and Mali Lošinj, and we did eat at the obscenely romantic Lanterna restaurant, in the shade of an old lighthouse, and we did take a taxi up to the Providenca at sunset, a viewpoint carved into a mountain top. And we did lie motionless on sunloungers with local aloe vera pulp smeared across our sunburned shoulders in the bloated afternoon sun.Though some wellness tourists expect to come home thinner, instead it felt as if we’d returned with a gorgeous weightlessness, the result of a week on this perfumed island with its daily catches and clear water. We braced once more on the tiny plane, our teeth rattling as we insisted, dry-mouthed, that the wings were meant to wobble like that. At home it took some time to rejoin our old commuting routines, our school runs, our doom. Some time to recover from the undiluted joy of a holiday like this, one that left us feeling… better.• A week’s half-board stay in the four-star Family Hotel Vespera costs from £708pp. A week’s half-board at the five-star Hotel Bellevue costs from £1,514pp, losinj-hotels.

Communal bathhouses were a common feature of Andalusian towns under Moorish rule. The Califa Hamam will combine a Roman-inspired caldarium, tepidarium and a frigidarium (hot, warm and cold baths) with a Moroccan steam room, massage room and a domed atrium where mint tea will be served. The company behind the new venture, the Califa Group, will also open a boutique hotel in Vejer’s medieval old town this spring.

The Love Trails Running Festival on the Gower Peninsula (4-7 July, tickets from £62pp) takes a more hedonistic approach with pub-crawl runs and a line-up of bands alongside the race programme, campfire talks, wood-fired hot tubs and wellbeing workshops. At the Big Retreat in Pembrokeshire, you can choose from more than 200 fitness and wellbeing classes, plus creative workshops (24-27 May, early-bird adult weekend tickets with camping from £144).People have been coming to take the waters at Bad Ragaz for almost 800 years, ever since Benedictine monks first discovered the healing properties of the warm spring water. The Grand Resort Bad Ragaz is home to one of the leading medical spas in the world, but a night at the hotel here will set you back at least £300. However, you can bathe in those same mineral-rich waters for the less terrifying price of £22. The Tamina Therme is a contemporary public bathhouse which opened in the town nine years ago.

At the forefront of this reinvention are two of the island’s most iconic hotels. Atzaro – one of Ibiza’s best-loved agroturismos, whose celebrity fans include Kate Hudson and Rihanna – has upgraded its spa facilities as part of a major revamp and launched walking and cycling breaks for winter and spring. Packages include guided hikes or bike rides with a nature guide, foraging for medicinal wild herbs and access to spa, yoga and wellness classes. In the evenings, chill out in the brand new Scandi-inspired garden sauna pod, or in front of one of the hotel’s log fires. And for further proof that times are changing: Pikes, the party hotel where the video for Wham’s Club Tropicana was famously shot, will host its first-ever fitness retreat this spring.

I hadn’t looked at it.Seven days before I was due to meet my fitness fate, my 17-year-old son also looked at the schedule. He promptly telephoned his older brother, who then rang me.“About this fitness thing,” he said, “I hear you’re doing something called ‘insanity’. Are you sure about all this?”My sons expressing concern for their unfit mother. I was touched. And secretly alarmed. From Thursday afternoon until Sunday lunchtime, a new world awaited: of beach runs and burpees, fasted HIIT and tabatas, circuits and squat jumps.I emailed James Davis, who runs 38°N – specialising in luxury fitness retreats in Marbella and Ibiza – with his wife Claire.“Am worried that I am too unfit to benefit from a weekend and that everyone else will be super-fit,” I wrote.“Please don’t worry,” he said. “We’ll do a fitness benchmark. From there, we adapt the training to the inidual.” In case he was lying, and because I dreaded the public humiliation more than the heart attack, I did some emergency pre-training: two jogs with the dog, one on my own, and two cycling and running sessions in a gym.The day before departure, I emailed James again: “Am slightly dreading being so hideously unfit.”“Everyone is at their own level,” he replied, “on their own journey, and we’ll have a great time.”And I did. In the words of the late artist Louise Bourgeois: “I have been to hell and back. And let me tell you, it was wonderful.”It really was. I did one form of high-intensity exercise after another, on the beach, on tarmac, in the gym. Just as Sisyphus pushed the rock up the mountain, so James and Claire pushed me on, and on.At 8am, for three mornings running, I did “Fasted HIIT: Metcon”. This translates as, skip breakfast, then do high intensity interval training and metabolic conditioning. I jumped through the rungs of a ladder on the sand, like footballers do did star jumps and wished I had a pelvic floor I saw, and swung, my first ever kettle bell, thrusting my hips outwards in what looked like a misguided mating call. I picked up two ropes thick enough to moor a tanker and tried, and failed, to wiggle them up and down. By Sunday morning, they were, if not ribbons in my hands, at least airborne.Two boxing sessions with James and I was hooked. I’ve since bought my own gloves and joined a boxing class. During the spin sessions, I slid off the saddle, swore volubly, sweated more, and felt like my legs were being ripped apart. But Claire got me through the pain barrier. She is dynamic, fun and magically motivating.I reported my triumphs, as well as the three-course lunches and sumptuous breakfast banquets overlooking the sea in this fabulous hotel, to the family. “I’m glad (and surprised) you’re still alive,” wrote my older son.I am surprised I’ve since joined a gym, go to this gym, and have signed up to a 38°N bespoke, 28-day HIIT home workout plan – short bouts of exercise won’t disrupt my day, so there’s a high chance I’ll do them, armed with my new, can-do mindset. I even fancy a 38°N pop-up fitness weekend in London later this year. I know I sound as if a cult has got me, but feeling energised is a revelation. Count me in.• 38°N’s Body: Reset Weekend at the Puente Romano Beach Resort and Spa, 7-10 March, costs £1,399pp based on two people sharing (thirtyeightdegreesnorth)Are babies and relaxation incompatible? Séamas O’Reilly finds out on a family spa break“Oh right… wow,” replied one pal, when we said we were doing a spa break with our four-month old. “Good for you,” they added, in the strained, halted speech you’d use if someone had announced their intention to eat the contents of a vacuum bag. Undeterred by such scepticism, we pledged to give it our all. The experience on offer seemed idyllic, two nights at a hotel and spa that catered specially to families, even babies. Taking a 90-minute train from Waterloo, we set out to do the unthinkable.“Not much nightlife around,” our cabbie said, just in case we’d come to Brockenhurst in search of an active local grime scene. “But families love coming here for the views.” On that point, he wasn’t wrong. Around 15 miles southwest of Southampton, New Park Manor Hotel \u0026amp Spa is set within the decidedly toothsome environs of the New Forest, and we hadn’t been within its gates for 60 seconds before we sighted deer striding through the open park.The manor itself is a grand old house that dates, in some form or another, to the 11th century. Since then it’s been inhabited by lords, landowners and, at one point, Nell Gwyn, mistress of Charles II. It’s only been operating as a hotel since 1970, which rather dashed my fond imaginings of William the Conqueror towelling down in the sauna after a busy day of mutton and jousting.While our room was prepared, we took in one of the nearby forest trails and found the effect so calming it took us a minute to realise our son was similarly transfixed himself. Ordinarily more of a picking-up-spoons-and-throwing-them guy, the perpetual fall of orange-red leaves had placed him in a state of cherubic hypnosis.New Park Manor is part of the Luxury Family Hotels group, which specialises in providing plush but unfussy breaks for families, and we entered our room to find a cot, changing mat, baby swimming togs and a rubber duckie. Even better were the bright and colourful creche facilities, to which we delivered the boy for two hours on both days of our stay. Fears he would fret once we parted were, in the end, unfounded. One glance at his charming new handlers was enough to scrub us from his memory, allowing us to take in the luxuriously appointed spa while he was lavished with attention.Leaving the fickle brute to his new pals, we made our way to the spa for the pool, treatment rooms, sauna and sanarium. This last concept was previously unknown to me, and comprised a room that’s basically a sauna, but at a lower temperature and slightly increased humidity. I found it had a gloriously balmy effect on my weary joints and, better still, the information plaque which listed the difference between it and a sauna was slightly obscured from view, so I could inform everyone who came in like some kind of spa connoisseur.My wife and I both had deep-tissue massages, and were rendered pleasantly cross-eyed by Jeanette, who worked our tired muscles until our brains dissolved into warm goo. Upon collecting him from the creche, we took the boy for his first ever swim, an activity to which he took such an immediate and ecstatic liking, it might be the highlight of our entire trip. Better yet, the easy come and go of other families meant we never felt in anyone’s way, and made us think a stay here would be truly ideal for slightly older children, as both the spa and the upstairs nook filled with books and toys, are perfect ersions for curious and mobile kids.We ate in the restaurant both evenings. I particularly enjoyed the chowder and my wife nearly screamed at her menu, the first she’d read in a while where vegetarian was not synonymous with “you can have mushroom risotto or some leaves”. The restaurant even offered baby monitors in case our little Michael Phelps rose from his slumber. He did, on both evenings, but the process of jaunting upstairs to settle him was so pain-free, it made us reflect on the true success of what was a wonderful weekend. Holidaying with a baby isn’t about having the work done for you it’s about providing the tools and environment to make that work more worth it than ever.• The Baby’s First Stay Away package costs from £469 for two nights, with dinner, including two 30-minute spa treatments, a two-hour creche session each day and welcome hamper (newparkmanorhotel)Center Parcs is known for many things – the weatherproof “sub-tropical swimming paradise” and a mind-boggling array of child-pleasing activities – but it’s not necessarily the first place you’d head to in search of a zen-like state of relaxation.

The pick of the bunch is the spa at Center Parcs’ Sherwood Forest site, which recently underwent a multi-million pound overhaul, resulting in a grown-up Scandinavian-inspired space which has been designed to make the most of the woodland environment and boasts the world’s first “treetop sauna”.

It’s hot, really hot, with a gloopy, oily consistency making it move strangely – less like water than a thick milkshake. Wading in, I find it is also ridiculously buoyant. Infused with magnesium salts, it’s three times denser than the Dead Sea. Why struggle to keep upright? I drop back and float. Blimey, it’s relaxing. I feel weightless, and spend the prescribed 10 minutes watching clouds drift overhead.I’m at the impressive Aquaforte spa, within Sardinia’s Forte Village. When the resort built its six thalassotherapy pools 25 years ago, it was something of a pioneer. The pools become successively cooler and less murky as guests progress through each 90-minute circuit.The second pool has a lower concentration of sea oil, plus anti-inflammatory aloe vera and mint. The third, is a sodium-rich pool with sea salt. The fourth is pure sea water with vigorous hydrojets. Pools five and six are the coldest – a refreshing 20C. They’re all in an idyllic setting surrounded by trees.“The term thalassotherapy comes from the Greek and means sea treatment,” says Dr Angelo Cerina, who created the spa in the 1990s. “It brings together a number of factors: climate, sun, wind, iodine-laden air, sand, muds and seaweed.”Each pool is designed for a different effect: buoyancy in the first pool is to help post-traumatic recovery, and the salt level promotes powerful draining effects. The full circuit is recommended for skin disorders, such as psoriasis, and joint problems – and for people like me for, simply, wonderful relaxation.(Note: it’s less relaxing if you shave your legs immediately before coming to the spa, because the salty water will sting like a thousand bees – but, happily, the sharp pain soon passes.)Forte Village is a giant beach resort 45 minutes from Cagliari airport, but arranged to feel small – intimate and exclusive. It has variety of room options in its eight hotels dotted around the lush gardens, from the bijou to palatial villas. During high season there are 21 restaurants (Sardinian, Mexican, Brazilian, pizza, gourmet…)Also, in high season, however, Forte Village is expensive, the shops packed with slick designer labels and restaurants run by celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay. We went in October when it was blissfully – sometimes eerily – quiet. Perfect for a spa break, and much easier on the wallet, though quite a few of the hotels, restaurants and facilities were closed.I was knackered and needed time-out, but others come for the high-tech medical centre, offering expert sports medicine, nutrition advice and osteopathy.Indeed, Forte Village is quite a magnet for top-ranking tennis players. While I was there, many up-and-coming pros worked out in the gym and relaxed their muscles in the pools after matches. Professor Pier Francesco Parra, medical specialist to the Italian Davis Cup national team who has treated the likes of Novak Djokovic and Venus Williams, is on hand during key periods to sort out the bad backs of the tennis players – and normal guests alike.The 90-minute pool circuit is as active as I get during our short stay. When I’ve dried off and wrapped myself in a fluffy bathrobe, I relax in the spa’s beautiful reception, sipping herbal tea, and reading from the tempting menu of hands-on body treatments. Salt exfoliation, followed by Ayurvedic massage using warm Sardinian honey? Or a water-based massage while floating in pool three?I went for the first: wonderful. But the best thing about being at Forte Village is to visit those magic pools every day, wade into that murky-brown water, and repeat the restful circuit again and again. • Forte Village Resort, Sardinia (fortevillageresort) offers three nights from £689pp, half board including return flights from Stansted with EasyJet (available April, May, September and October).

As she entered the airport’s arrivals area, she was accompanied by Canada’s minister of foreign affairs, Chrystia Freeland, who has been a vocal critic of Saudi Arabia’s jailing of female dissidents.“This is Rahaf al-Qunun, a very brave new Canadian,” Freeland told reporters, holding on to al-Qunun, who was wearing a “Canada” sweatshirt.The 18-year-old’s fight against deportation from Thailand as she tried to claim asylum captivated a global audience through her Twitter account, which had 157,000 followers as of Saturday.A number of countries had expressed interest in resettling al-Qunun, including Australia, which was her first choice – but it was Canada that acted quickly.“That is something that we are pleased to do because Canada is a country that understands how important it is to stand up for human rights, to stand up for women’s rights around the world,” the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Friday.The head of Canada’s United Nations refugee office, Jean-Nicolas Beuze, tweeted his thanks to the country for “having acted swiftly in providing a long-term solution”.“Women refugees at risk because of their gender are prioritised for resettlement \u0026amp we know they can count on Canada,” he wrote.Trudeau downplayed the symbolism of Canada’s offer to resettle the young woman Canada and Saudi Arabia have been at odds over the past year over the conservative kingdom’s human rights record.Last summer, a tweet in Arabic, sent by Global Affairs Canada, set off a diplomatic row between the two nations, in which Canadian diplomats were expelled from the kingdom, Saudi students in Canada were recalled and the Saudi government sold numerous Canadian equities and currency holdings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c6dc6e8729f32e73af98f56e589ee0ff8ad2efc/0_36_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=088a56079e6930f5128695b09647786f","title":"wendy searle anarctica race womens record south pole louis rudd","story":"When Louis Rudd crossed the finishing line of his 925-mile solo trek across Antarctica last month, the first person he contacted was Wendy Searle. “I’ve done it!!!!” the army captain texted her.It was the news that the 41-year-old Searle, a Ministry of Defence civil servant and Rudd’s expedition leader, had spent sleepless nights waiting for. “I’d known he was going to do it two or three days before but hearing he was there safely, that he had completed it as he’d set out to … I was elated. And completely relieved.”Next year Searle plans to be in the centre of Antarctica sending a similar message. She is planning to break the women’s world speed record for skiing solo to the south pole, unassisted and unaided, with Rudd as her expedition leader. “It will be a huge challenge but I think everyone’s got one big adventure in them.”Searle will need to ski 702 miles across the frozen continent in less than 38 days, 23 hours and five minutes. “I can’t have any outside assistance and I have to take everything with me in a special sledge called a pulk: all my food, my fuel, my supplies, everything. I can’t have any food resupplies or medical help. I cannot even accept a cup of tea,” she said. “I’ll be completely alone and, in all likelihood I won’t see anybody else.”Searle is 5ft 5in tall and weighs just over 60kg the pulk will weigh over 80kg. As training for the expedition, she is spending more than 10 hours a week lifting weights and running up and down hills pulling a tyre, while also holding down a full-time job in the Ministry of Defence press office.Knowing how difficult and dangerous the trip is going to be forces Searle to prioritise it. “When you know that, if you don’t do your training, one day that might be the difference between success and failure, then it’s a huge motivator.”Her family – her husband is a soldier and they have three teenage daughters and a nine-year-old son – are doing all they can to support her. “My children are super-independent, and they do a lot of managing upwards. They’ll say, ‘don’t forget parents evening and these are the appointments I’ve got you’. They’re amazing.” She is determined to show them that following your dreams is worth doing. “I want my children to think: if you pursue things with a passion, you will achieve the results you want to. I want them to see that it’s OK to pursue something with a white-hot passion in a single-minded way and focus on a goal.”Five years ago, Searle had never considered crossing the Antarctic. Then she managed the media campaign of an expedition to the south pole by a team of military personnel. “I became hooked.”She discovered the first woman hadn’t set foot on Antarctica until 1935, even though men had been going there for 100 years before that. It made her wonder if she could have a go herself. “Being around the pole community made it seem like a totally normal idea.”Despite the fact that she’d had no previous polar training and had never skied before, she successfully skied 350 miles across the Greenland ice sheet last year. “One thing I learned is that my polar expedition is going to be incredibly tough, mentally.”I definitely missed my children. But all I could think at the time was: no one day has been as bad or is ever going to be as bad as the six months I spent pretty much on my own in Germany when I was 25. My husband was away fighting in Iraq, I had a house, a dog and three children under four I was solely responsible for, and six months of just absolutely relentless grinding tiredness.As a woman, she faces certain physical challenges. “If you’re going for a pee in the Antarctic it is decidedly easier from a logistics point of view to be a guy. Periods are also a massive issue.” She will take medication to stop herself menstruating.Training for her adventures has changed who she is as a person. “Doing things that push me beyond what I thought I might be able to do, that has become a huge part of my life. I can’t imagine not doing those things now.” Searle is still raising money to fund the £50,000 expedition and hopes to raise a further £50,000 for charity. She says it is more difficult to attract sponsorship as a female polar explorer. “People need to get behind female adventurers. I asked a well-known TV agent why she doesn’t have more of us on her books and she said: ‘Honestly, there just isn’t the market for it.’ I’ve heard people in bookshops looking for adventure titles say: ‘Oh no, I don’t want to read anything by a woman.’”This kind of sexism is a vicious circle, she says. “If you’re not seeing women and mothers going on expeditions and doing amazing things, then how do you know women do that?” But they do, she says – she is part of a community of would-be female adventurers joining groups such as Adventure Queens or Love Her Wild.Searle hopes her story will change perceptions about who should be doing polar travel and is dismayed by the number of women she meets who tell her they could never do what she is doing. “They say that without even stopping to think about whether they could. I’ve got four kids and a full-time job. If I can do it, why can’t they?”But she adds: “I think there’s definitely a groundswell of women who want to go out and have adventures. They’re doing cool stuff, they just don’t shout about it. They don’t need that validation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d81421e85dbb7fcdfb471c7cf6cb4dcfacaf90d/0_150_4509_2705/master/4509.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3fdc7e7623add7a7aaa4247f27b2356","title":"democratic republic congo africa ageing leaders close watch power struggle","story":"After a tumultous week, the streets of the cities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are likely to be quiet on Sunday as congregations file into churches to hear priests and preachers call for the Lord’s blessing on a troubled land.Few doubt that the DRC is at a critical moment. The long-delayed elections that were finally held on 30 December could still be a turning point, leading the resource-rich nation to a better future. Or they could send the vast central African country, which has not known a peaceful transfer of power since it gained independence from Belgium in 1960, back into anarchy.Supporters of Martin Fayulu, a widely respected former business executive and parliamentarian, accuse Félix Tshisekedi, leader of the DRC’s biggest opposition party, of doing a deal with outgoing president Joseph Kabila. The announced results bear no resemblance to the real vote, Fayulu has said.Across the continent, the election and the post-poll power struggle pitting two opposition leaders against each otherhas been closely watched as almost everywhere else on the continent politics has reached a turning point. This year there will be more than 20 elections in Africa – from Algeria on the Mediterranean to the economic powerhouse of Nigeria in the west and in South Africa, on the continent’s southern tip. Younger voters are demanding change from an ageing generation of leaders, who are now seen as repressive, not liberating. New dynamics have been unleashed by rapid urbanisation, economic growth and social media. A new crop of leaders is emerging.One indicator is rising voter participation after a period of decline. “Where there is a sense that venal elites have stolen resources and are not delivering, there are strong protest votes. People sense they can really change things,” said Alex Vines, director of Chatham House’s Africa programme.In the DRC, the stakes are higher than elsewhere. The 1997-2002 civil war killed five million people, but the importance attached to ensuring stability is a double-edged sword.If it explains why the leaders of South Africa and Angola pushed Kabila, who took office in 2001, to hold elections, it also explains the absence of stronger statements voicing misgivings about possible manipulation to allow opposition leader Tshisekedi to take power.Comments by French and Belgian ministers on rigging allegations in the DRC rankled with African officials, said Peter Fabricius, an analyst in South Africa. “Immediately, it became us and them. The attitude was: who are these outsiders from former colonial powers to tell us our elections aren’t good enough?” Some analysts see a shift away from democratic aspiration in Africa and a growing desire for more authoritarian government. Even as Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, surfs a wave of popular enthusiasm as he moves his huge nation away from a hybrid Chinese model, there is a fear the strategy apparently pursued by Kabila in the DRC will be attractive to some leaders.Cheeseman said few powers had criticised an election campaign during which major opposition figures were forced into exile, human rights abuses were widespread and untried voting machines were deployed.“If leaders can see that they can get away with that kind of election now … what is their motive to hold a better one in the future?” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0966bec950725eb0805436cbcbd973a48b84a0f/0_89_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=821c97d18fb49c56da8bc51173224401","title":"worlds biggest aircraft airlander 10 retired from service","story":"UK firm behind plane-airship hybrid says it will ‘rethink the skies’ to make new modelThe world’s largest aircraft, the Airlander 10, has been retired from service following an ill-fated development process, with engineers to “rethink the skies” in a new model.Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV), the Bedford-based firm which built Airlander 10, has already received Civil Aviation Authority backing for the development, and it is hoped the airship will take to the skies by the early 2020s.“Our focus is now entirely on bringing the first batch of production-standard, type-certified Airlander 10 aircraft into service with customers,” said Stephen McGlennan, the firm’s CEO.“The prototype served its purpose as the world’s first full-sized hybrid aircraft, providing us with the data we needed to move forward from prototype to production-standard. As a result, we do not plan to fly the prototype aircraft again.”The Airlander 10 undertook six test flights, some of which ended in chaos, but the company stressed it was their decision not to rebuild the prototype aircraft, saying it had done its job and gathered an immense amount of data in the process.The Airlander 10 prototype crashed in 2016 on its second test flight after a successful 30-minute maiden voyage. Another mishap befell the 92-metre-high (302ft), 44-metre-wide aircraft in 2017 when a woman was taken to hospital after its hull automatically deflated when the vessel came loose from its moorings.HAV subsequently made a £32m insurance claim, which it told shareholders was the “maximum insured value”. However, it said that its focus now was on producing Airlander 10s for customers around the world, rather than continuing to develop prototypes.McGlennan said: “Instead we move ahead with a big job – eight years after the initial build of the prototype, we are now identifying our critical supplier partners, getting ready to design all the details that make the difference between a prototype and a product, and finalising the product certification plans.“Many people ask me this question – when will Airlander be flying again? My answer is this – look for many, many Airlanders flying again, ready to be delivered to customers and used around the world.”The original £25m model was first developed as a surveillance aircraft for the US army, and its first flight took place in 2012 before the programme was cancelled in 2013.HAV then reacquired it, reassembling the part-plane, part-airship and its four diesel engine-driven propellers at RAF Cardington, Bedfordshire, where it was being modified for civilian use.The company said it was in a “strong position to launch production” of the new aircraft, with the design already approved by the European Aviation Safety Agency."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Crash happened on Saturday morning when vehicle struck ditch near DunmanwayPoland urges European Union and Nato to develop joint position on technology giantThe men who are from Dublin were detained in connection with supply of drugs and firearms in Ireland and UKSuspect appears in court following organised attack on KBC Bank eviction groupSport inspired by Harry Potter wizarding game continues to evolve worldwideUp to 200 mainly left-wing activists gather at City Hall intending to send \u0026lsquopowerful message\u0026rsquoBurqa, body shaming, single-use plastic, craft beer, hard border and pay gap some of the latest additions to English-Irish dictionaryBiggest political mistake is to be dismissive of with migration concerns \u0026ndash VaradkarTrains not running between Connolly and Grand Canal Dock due to upgrades at PearseFamilies displaced from their Magheracloone homes by subsidence want solutionsModern variants \u0026lsquolike taking an acid trip\u0026rsquo, with spike in addiction and psychosisQuestions on pensions, passports and travel for Irish living in the London commuter townStorm deposited Dooagh sand back after 30 years but beach now washed away againEuropean Commission clarifications unlikely to sway minds of DUPClip shows man who lost wife, daughter in crash involving unaccompanied learner driverQuestion remains if Rome will allow the Dublin Archbishop to goMan (24) to be sentenced in March after \u0026euro18,100 was transferred to his accountNorwich City Council investigating whether \u0026lsquoOrlando\u0026rsquos\u0026rsquo is being used as Japanese eateryRise in cases sees thousands sign petition seeking expansion of vaccination scheme"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3756302.1547315443!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"quidditch players gather in dublin for european broomstick event","story":"The Irish Quidditch Cup took place in Dublin and the winners of the Harry Potter inspired game would go on to represent Ireland in the Quidditch European Cup. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe second Irish Quidditch Cup took place in Dublin’s Trinity College with the winning team going on to represent Ireland in the European Quidditch Cup Division 2 2019 in PolandTwenty-five years ago the word quidditch barely existed in the English language. Today, not only is this term instantly-recognisable to legions of Harry Potter fans as the primary sport in J K Rowling’s wizarding world, but it has also evolved into a real-life, international sporting activity.Quidditch started out in the early 2000s as a sporting activity for American Potter-aficionados eager to recreate the magical broomstick competitions from their childhood tales. However, over the years the sport, which consists of athletes running around with a broom between their legs, has become a popular game among students and Potter enthusiasts alike.On Saturday morning, players from around Ireland gathered on the cricket pitch in Trinity College to hold the annual Irish Quidditch Cup to select a team to travel to Poland in April to take part in the European quidditch games.Philip Moore, a member of the Dublin Draíochta Dragons and head coach of the Irish national quidditch team, says the sport has continued to evolve since college students in the United States first began holding matches in 2005.“Every couple of years we have a new rule book because things change. The pitch used to be round like in the books but we’ve decided it’s more convenient to have it squared. Elements of the sport from the books are still here we still have bludgers and beaters and the golden snitch.”Mr Moore describes the game as a mix of handball, rugby and dodge ball, adding that it’s “very community orientated” and “extremely inclusive”. One of the primary rules states that a team – consisting of 21 players but with only seven allowed on the pitch at any one time – can only have four people of one gender playing during the match.“For people who are non-binary or agendered, however that person identifies themselves, they are marked down as that gender by the referee. It’s become very popular with the LGBTQ community because of this. It’s very rare that a trans person can play as a man or a woman, however they choose.”The International Quidditch Association describes the game as a mixed gender contact sport played by more than 500 teams in more than 26 countries worldwide. It says the sport seeks to improve gender education across sport while promoting equality, ersity, leadership and physical activity. In July 2017 the Irish national quidditch team participated in the European Quidditch Cup in Norway, joining teams from across Europe including Austria, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Turkey, Germany and the UK.Sebastian Steinke from Germany travelled to Dublin this weekend especially to take part in the Irish quidditch event. He first started playing the game because of his love of the Harry Potter books but quickly discovered a real appreciation for the wizarding sport. “It’s an intensive sport but very inclusive which is something I really like about,” Mr Steinke told The . “It doesn’t matter who you are or where you come from. It’s a sport for everyone and a very open-minded community.”Our daily offering of wacky news from around the world"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3756279.1547309279!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mary lou mcdonald defends sinn f%C3%A9in attendance at maduro inauguration","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpeaking in Dublin on Saturday Sinn Féin president Mary Lou  McDonald said many people would not endorse the leadership of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on the basis of poverty that they may be suffering. File photograph: John ThysAFPGetty ImagesSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has defended two senior party members attending the inauguration earlier this week of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro. The party has been heavily criticised for sending MLA Conor Murphy and general secretary Dawn Doyle to the event as Mr Maduro’s re-election has been denounced at home and abroad.Ms McDonald said that Mr Maduro had been “democratically elected”and noted there were people in Ireland too who would not endorse the leadership of the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. On Thursday Niall Collins, Fianna Fáil’s foreign affairs spokesman, said Sinn Féin’s presence at the inauguration was “just another example” of why the party is “unfit for government”.The vast majority of the opposition in Venezuela boycotted last year’s vote on the grounds that it was rigged in favour of Mr Maduro, noting a host of irregularities, including Socialist Party activists offering monetary payments to voters.However, he continues to enjoy support from the armed forces, leaving him with few serious challenges at home despite the international outcry.Speaking in Dublin on Saturday Ms McDonald said, “Yes, we had representatives in Venezuela for the inauguration of the democratically elected president. Politics increasingly is reflective of the fact that we live in a global village. We were there as part of a delegation, we were there because we were invited and I’m very glad that two Sinn Féin representatives were in attendance.“As to endorsing others, the important thing is that countries freely select their political leaderships and freely elect their governments and their government officials. “So it’s not for us to be endorsing or otherwise, we have our political work to do here. We present ourselves for election here to the people of Ireland,” she added.Mr Maduro replaced Hugo Chavez after his death in 2013 and won a six-year term last year despite hyperinflation, chronic food shortages and a severe economic contraction hitting the country. He blames an “economic war” led by the US and local opposition adversaries for the country’s woes.Ms McDonald said many people would not endorse the leadership of Mr Varadkar on the basis of poverty that they may be suffering.“You see there would be people who live in this country who would not endorse the leadership of Leo Varadkar on the basis that they endure poverty, some of them live in hotel rooms and many of them are only barely getting by on very low wages.“I think we also have to acknowledge that he is the Taoiseach and so I think there is a distinction between what people legitimately within their democracies might say or a view that they might have around a political leadership.“There’s a distinction between that and saying well that’s not legitimate,” she said.“We believe that the Venezuelan election was open and democratic and the president has been elected. Let me tell you this, it is for the people of Venezuela and for them alone to decide who their president is and who leads them and that’s our position. It’s the only democratic position you can have.”Ms McDonald said she was comparing Mr Varadkar and Mr Manduro “only in as much as elections and the selection of leaders and governments are for the population of the country concerned.”“So for us, you know, we decide and people go to the polls and they make their democratic selection and that’s as it should be across the world. That’s the only point I’m making.“I was answering the point of people having internal critics and experiencing poverty on the watch of any particular leader and I was simply making the point which I think is a truthful point that here in this democracy equally you would have people who are very critical of the government on the basis that they are experiencing poverty and that they are having a hard time.”Meanwhile Ms McDonald said she was “very concerned” at any suggestion that the fire at a disused hotel in Rooskey on the Leitrim-Roscommon border which was to open as a centre for asylum seekers had been started deliberately.“There was somebody in the hotel at the time. I understand that if fire had started later into the night that there could have been a very very tragic outcome,” she said.“It concerns me also any suggestion that people would act in a hostile manner in respect of new people, refugees coming to a community, and I say that very mindful of the fact that very often the State and the system can create some of these tensions within communities by not, you know, going down and talking to and collaborating with people who live in Rooskey or elsewhere.“There’s a way in a very, very compassionate and a very decent and a very friendly way that’s true to our Irish temperament to deal with these issues and to make a welcome to people who are vulnerable but it has to be done in a way in which communities feel included. That they don’t feel that they’re left on the outside and that no bad feeling is allowed to brew, but I await the investigation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun was granted asylum after flying to Thailand to escapeRemoval is first sign of Trump\u0026rsquos slowed Syria exit, as US troops remain with coalitionSaudis, UAE and Egypt willing to embrace Assad if it curbs influence of Iran and TurkeyRahaf Mohammed al-Qunun barricaded herself in hotel room in Bangkok airportTurkish president makes scathing speech to parliament as US adviser still in AnkaraRahaf Mohammed al-Qunun (18), who is seeking asylum, had barricaded herself inside hotelNew law aims to protect women from having their marriages ended without their knowledgeUS indicates troop withdrawal will be slower than suggested suddenly by presidentVillagers were digging for gold illegally when tunnel caved in, say Afghan officialsShelling persists between insurgents and army as Tahrir al-Sham holds most of IdlibTrump administration has cut $300m funding, reducing agency\u0026rsquos budget by a thirdProsecutors say Turkey did not answer two requests made for evidence in the caseBrazil\u0026rsquos new president promised to reduce power of environmental agencies during election campaignIn the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan a clinic provides essential care to Syrian mothersThree separate operations follow fatal bombing of tourist bus in GizaMBS came under pressure after the brutal murder of the journalist Jamal KhashoggiFinding work and education is a problem, but most would not choose to return to SyriaAt least 10 others injured following detonation of explosive device in tourist areaStatement contradicts reports last week that the US was to withdraw 7,000 soldiersTurkey appears determined to boost relations with Moscow as US becomes unreliable"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3756354.1547370931!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"saudi teenager fleeing family arrives in canada","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAsylum seeker Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, smiles as she is introduced to the media at Toronto Pearson International Airport. Photograph:  Cole BurstonGetty ImagesIt was another proud moment for Canada: a Saudi teenager who had just been granted asylum walking through the arrivals gate at Toronto airport embraced by the country’s popular foreign minister. Wearing a gray hoodie emblazoned with the word “Canada,” 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun smiled at the cameras that greeted her. But she left it to Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland to do the talking. The minister presented her as a “very brave new Canadian.” “Where we can save a single person, where we can save a single woman, that is a good thing to do,” said Ms Freeland, who refused to answer repeated questions about how this decision will affect Canada’s strained relationship with Saudi Arabia. “And I’d like to also emphasise, this is part of a broader Canadian policy of supporting women and girls in Canada and around the world.”The Saudi teenager became a cause celebre for women’s and refugee rights after fleeing her family during a holiday in Kuwait to seek asylum. She described her life in an interview with The New York Times as one of unrelenting abuse at the hands of her family, who live in the city of Hail, in northern Saudi Arabia. She said she was once locked in a room for six months because she had cut her hair in a way that her family did not approve of and that her family members used to beat her, particularly her brother.Two years ago, after an unsuccessful suicide attempt, her family did not seek help for her, she said. It was then she started planning her escape. Her chance for freedom came last week, when her family took a trip to Kuwait, which does not have the same restrictions on women.But once she arrived in Bangkok last Saturday, planning to travel on to Australia, she said her passport was confiscated and Thai officials threatened to return her to her family. Her brother and father arrived in Bangkok, demanding that she return with them.Instead, she barricaded herself in a Thai airport hotel, opened a Twitter account and mounted a social media campaign for her asylum. After Thai officials relented, and the United Nations declared her a refugee, the Canadian government agreed to grant her asylum. – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyJapanese plunge into ice bath at Tokyo shrine in purification ritual for New YearKinship carers are being \u0026#39ignored and exploited\u0026#39 by the system, MPs are warned Comment: Surprise, surprise - not all us young people are Remainers\u0026#39More efficient than clockwork\u0026#39?

No one talked about football.Or, if they did, in England, they only made passing reference to the FA Cup matches. But, of the fervent attention normally devoted to the Premier League, there was not a mention.Saturday and Sunday were cup days. And without the Premier League, they felt quite flat as a result.It’s incredible, just how tight is the Premier League’s grip on the national psyche. From a standing start in 1992, it’s grown to become Britain’s most successful brand. You don’t believe me, you’re not that interested in football and you’re attributing my claim to the hyperbole that surrounds the elite of the beautiful game?Mahabis collapse should give other firms pause for thoughtA Populus poll found that far and away the most recognised British brand in the world was the Premier League. They tested 20,000 people in 20 countries with 10 of our best-known names – and the Premier League dominated, miles ahead of the likes of BBC, Rolls-Royce, Jaguar Land Rover, and yes, even the royal family.Hard to imagine, given the stacks of souvenirs for the House of Windsor on sale to tourists in the gift shops, the crowds that flock daily to stand and stare at Buckingham Palace, and the coverage heaped upon Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle, but, overall, more folk worldwide are interested in the outcome of Man City v Liverpool.Remarkably, as well, reports GlobalWebIndex, the consumer profiling firm, a bigger proportion of the population watches Premier League matches on TV in Thailand, Egypt and Indonesia than in the UK. According to Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University Business School, interviewed by Mat Snow for managmenttoday, the clever bit was in making the Premier League competitive.The Premier League has successfully tapped in to consumers’ desire to be part of the creation of a product – ‘co-creation’ or ‘prosumption’ to use the vogue wordsAll the Premier League members have a share (the bottom three are replaced each year by the three coming up) and nobody has more muscle than others. This means that relative to rival leagues overseas, the difference in financial reward between top and bottom is actually fairly small (£150m to the champions Manchester City last season, £95m to bottom-placed West Brom). Because the playing field at least in this regard is reasonably level there is a chance, always, of an upset – that lesser clubs can afford to buy good players and give a decent account of themselves. They can, witness Leicester City, with a fair wind over an entire season, go on and win the thing.Of course, such largesse does not extend to the depth of the owner’s pocket or the strength of support and size of the stadium. So Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham enjoy the advantages of additional wealth and spending power. But at least where a share of the TV rights is concerned, the spoils are distributed more evenly.What every Premier League team needs in the January transfer windowIt’s this competitiveness that makes the Premier League so appealing. Says Chadwick: “On holiday in Sicily in 2012, a group of Swedish guys were watching Barcelona on TV. I was saying how wonderful they were to watch – Messi, Iniesta and so on – but they said, ‘No, this is terrible: it’s just pass, pass, pass. We like the Premier League – it’s fast and intense, a battle between big aggressive guys and quick, skilful little guys.’ It’s basic and primitive. Premier League football is about competing – to survive, to protect our identity, to ward off hostile forces.”What the Premier League\u0026nbsphas mastered also is the art of consumer involvement. Ironically, it’s the aspects that English football used to be so criticised for, says Chadwick, that have become its advantage. “I cannot advocate a sanitised, quiet, perfectly civilised afternoon, a tea party where we kick a ball around. A lot of the Premier League’s strengths, the speed of the game, the tribalism, the passion, are all caught up. If people were not irrationally involved it would not be the great league that it is.”The Premier League has successfully tapped in to consumers’ desire to be part of the creation of a product – “co-creation” or “prosumption” to use the vogue words. Other corporates need to take a look at the Premier League’s success. It’s easy to mock the hype surrounding the league: the vast payments from TV and sponsors, the cost of tickets, the stars’ enormous earnings. But these, along with the breathless excitement of radio phone-ins, Match of the Day, and Sky, complete with its pioneering computer-generated graphics and Gary Neville’s technical analysis, all add up to a compelling package.Involving consumers, giving them a say, listening to them, explaining the product, taking it apart, inspiring loyalty, talking about it – these are all key ingredients in the enticing Premier League mix.The days when customers were encouraged to stay apart, to remain detached, and to take a back seat are long gone. Fans need, and want, to be engaged, to be asked about the business, to feel as though it belongs to them, that they somehow part-own it, and are responsible for its development and evolution.This means taking them with you, communicating to them treating them as equals, and not speaking down to them, not hiding or obfuscating. A tall order, but one that others have managed, not just the Premier League. Richard Branson steered Virgin to heights because he made passengers feel they were sharing in the airline’s journey.The Premier League is back this weekend. I can’t wait. See, that’s the effect it has\u0026nbspthat’s its achievement.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Forsman\u0026nbsphad been working as a photographer for a while, but\u0026nbspshe had only had a few stock images listed on Getty, one of the biggest stock photo agencies. In 2014 she learned\u0026nbspabout Stocksy,\u0026nbspa platform co-operative, which puts the photographer in charge of their own work.\u0026nbspWhy co-operatives could be the answer to the UK\u0027s social care crisisThe design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeThe sharing economy is failing because people can’t be trustedProfessional photographers find it much harder to make money out of stock photographs as smartphones and social media have opened up the field to amateurs. Many aspiring photographers now sell stock photos at a loss to try and make a name for themselves. Agencies have a steady flow of this under-priced content, making it harder to professionals, who are stuck in one-to-one relationships with little bargaining power, to command worthwhile fees.“Photographers can\u0027t act as a group for their interests against exploitative agencies,” Forsman says. “The co-op model makes the photographers organised as an agency, which means that there is nobody to exploit them.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMike Cook, acting chief executive of Stocksy, says putting the workers in control of the business was “a no-brainer”.“Why don’t all businesses work this way?” he says. Stocksy has high-standards for artists that means it can command higher fees, avoiding a race-to-the-bottom in the industry. At Stocksy, photographers get between 50 and 75 per cent of the proceeds when their stock photos are used, significantly higher than the 30 per cent or less offered by other agencies.Forsman says: “This makes it much easier for me to depend on stock for revenue, because the co-op does not exploit contributors but instead seeks to make their work financially sustainable.”Co-operatives have been around since the 19th Century, but technology has opened up new possibilities for how they are run. Next-generation platform co-ops, which bring together global communities of traders in an industry, have been seen as one answer to the problematic gig economy. They are an alternative to top-down platforms like Uber and Airbnb, where executives profit from gig workers who may lack the security of a proper contract and benefits like holiday and sick pay.Platform co-ops are growing in popularity in the UK. In December Equal Care Co-op, or Eccoo, started recruiting care workers in the Calder Valley for a new kind of social care, where those receiving and giving care are in charge of the business, including how much they work and for how long. Rather than changing a commission and extracting value from the workers and those receiving care, Eccoo provides a platform for workers and those receiving care to choose one another and gives them control over how how and for how long they are supported.Eccoo is offering a vital alternative to care agencies that pay minimum wage to employees who have little say over their hours and may be fired on a “one strike and you’re out” system. “The biggest issue for me was having the reassurance of getting enough work and having theright amount,” says Fran Watson, a founding member of equal care and an independent care worker. “I know of no independent care workers who do 15-minute slots. You just can’t do it. The options are either to go with an agency or go it alone.”Forsman, a London-based photographer (Courtesy Photo)In 2017, New Internationalist, a magazine dedicated to social justice and equality, raised £704,114 through community shares, offering its readers the chance to own the magazine in return for securing its future. The editorial staff are still hammering out the processes that readers will contribute to decisions at the magazine.\u0026nbsp“The feelings range from anxiety about what ceding control would look like to excitement about what that represents,” says Hazel Healy, an editor of New Internationalist. “I think it would be hugely beneficial to us and a great experiment to deepen the democracy further but it’s going to need to be cleverly done.”\u0026nbspNew Internationalist has been talking to Stocksy about proprietary software it uses to support decision-making among artists from all over the globe. When Mike Cook first joined Stocksy, the business was making decisions the old-fashioned way, by members submitting motions that were voted on at an annual general meeting.\u0026nbspThis model had its limitations for members that were based in different timezones and speaking different languages. So Stocksy created a system where a contributor can submit an idea, however vague, into a forum for discussion. Members are sent an email to vote if the idea should be advanced. When a minimum quorum of 10 per cent of members have voted yes to a proposal, it is advanced to the board where it can either be approved, or go to a vote.\u0026nbspThe system has already been used to give members the say on whether the membership cap at Stocksy should be lifted. Cook says the decision was one of the most contentious the co-operative had ever faced. “We have customers who love our content but tell us that we don’t have enough. We have worked with our members to create more content where we can, but we have a bell-curve of members, from stay-at-home parents who take photos part time, to full time photographers, make their living from stock.”The membership cap of 1000 artists was forcing Stocksy to prioritise more productive photographers. “It’s hard to say you must produce more or we cut you off,” Cook says. “This is what the cap was making us do, we realised when we got close to the cap we might have to replace some users with more productive ones.”\u0026nbspAt the same time, longstanding Stocksy contributors were worried that lifting the cap would “open the floodgates” of contributors, Cook says, watering down the agency’s reputation for quality. Sara Wager, a hobbiest astrophotographer who creates one or two images of the stars each month, joined Stocksy in 2017. She worried that lifting the cap might stop photographers with a smaller output from contributing. “I reached out to the Stocksy folk and they understood that I have niche images that can take many months to complete and so my uploads will be sporadic,” she says. “They really put my mind at rest that I was as valued a member as anyone else.”Sara was also able to participate in forums discussing lifting the cap. When the proposal was voted through, the board reached a compromise where members could vote to freeze membership each year, depending on how many contributors have been added. “This combination of informal talk, transparency and more formal processes of voting means that I feel a belonging and co-ownership to the co-op,” says Forsman.\u0026nbspStocksy, which employs 29 people at its base in British Columbia and several more in the US, sells photos to larger agencies, tech companies and other business. It had revenues of $10 million in 2018, making it much smaller than standard industry agencies like Getty and iStock. But its business model means that the photographers can command a fairer price than they might at much larger agencies. Cook says that while their decision-making processes might take longer, the transparent process means that photographers feel a sense of loyalty and community at Stocksy that is missing elsewhere.“I realise in the wrong company I’ll sound like a raving socialist,” Cook says. “But the reason we have a business is the contributors, so why shouldn’t they fairly profit from that? It’s not socialism, it’s fairness.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some estimates suggest she could lose by 200 votes.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCabinet ministers ‘should resign’ to stop no-deal Brexit, says GrieveHis comments drew condemnation from Labour MP David Lammy, who described it as a “desperate attempt\u0026nbspto use a tiny far-right minority to hold our democracy to ransom”.Just days before the critical Brexit\u0026nbspvote, Mr Grayling told the Daily Mail: “This is too important for political game-playing and I urge Conservative\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho back Brexit and others to back the deal.“If not, we risk a break with the British tradition of moderate, mainstream\u0026nbsppolitics\u0026nbspthat goes back to the Restoration in 1660.”He said there would be a “different tone” in British\u0026nbsppolitics\u0026nbspif Britain failed to leave the EU, and predicted a “less tolerant society” and a “more nationalistic nation”.“It will open the door to extremist populist political forces in this country of the kind we see in other countries in Europe,” Mr Grayling said.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?Article 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteTop Brexit donors predict Britain will stay in EU“If\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho represent seats that voted 70 per cent\u0026nbspto leave say, ‘Sorry guys, we’re still going to have freedom of movement’, they will turn against the political mainstream.”Mr\u0026nbspLammy, who backs the Best for Britain campaign, said: “This is a desperate attempt by a government minister to use a tiny far-right minority to hold our democracy to ransom. It is gutter politics.\u0026nbsp“History shows us appeasement only emboldens the far right and impoverishing the country through Brexit will only increase resentment.”Ms Soubry, who was branded a Nazi\u0026nbspby a mob who targeted her during live television interviews outside parliament on Monday, described Mr Grayling\u0027s comments as irresponsible nonsense.She tweeted: The 15 yobs who have been roaming outside parliament do not represent anyone but themselves. It\u0027s shameful to validate them in this way.Right-wing extremists have always existed. Brexit is just an excuse - this is their real agenda.Pro-EU MP Luciana\u0026nbspBerger\u0026nbspaccused Mr Grayling of “cowering behind the small threat of far-right extremism” to avoid offering the public another referendum.The Labour MP, who has been subjected to relentless abuse and death threats, said: “These remarks are not only grossly irresponsible but also show just how desperate supporters of this proposed withdrawal agreement have become.“We absolutely need to heal isions in our society but we will not do so with a Brexit that makes us poorer and offers less control.“And the answer to a small band of far-right thugs roaming the streets must never be to capitulate and restrict our democratic engagement – it must be more democracy.”Labour veteran Roy\u0026nbspHattersley\u0026nbspdismissed the claims as “absurd”, adding: “I don’t think many people would regard Chris Grayling as an expert on these matters.”Lord\u0026nbspHattersley, a former Labour deputy leader who backs a Final Say referendum, told BBC Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme: “Nobody voted for Mrs May’s package. Nobody had the faintest idea what Mrs May’s package would be.“It’s only reasonable that now we do know what it amounts to, what leaving really means, that people have an opportunity to vote on that. It’s a different vote.”Lord Hattersley was due to address a People’s Vote rally in Sheffield on Saturday, along with Dame Margaret Beckett and Sir Vince Cable, but had to pull out due to illness.The row over the transport secretary’s comments comes after a week of heightened tensions in Westminster, when\u0026nbspBrexit secretary Stephen Barclay was condemned by MPs for saying\u0026nbspthe abuse hurled at MPs showed it would be too “isive” to stage another public vote.The Independent revealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And then, in the 2017 general election, 80 per cent\u0026nbspof you voted for MPs who stood on manifestos to respect that referendum result. You have delivered your instructions. Now it is our turn to deliver for you.“When you turned out to vote in the referendum, you did so because you wanted your voice to be heard.

Monday 21 could be parliament’s last chance to avoid the cliff edge. The decision on a people’s vote can’t be put off any longer.”Sarah Wollaston, a leading Tory Final Say supporter, said it was time for the prime minister to concede a fresh referendum on Brexit without delay.“Because parliament has reached an impasse, the right thing for her to do is say ‘parliament can’t decide, I’m going to take it to the people direct’,” she said.Created with Sketch.

It’s wake up time – we have a very short time in which to sort this out.”But Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out it did not have legal force, saying: “Parliament can pass motions saying the moon is made of green cheese, but that doesn’t mean it’s legally binding.”A total of 17 Tory MPs rebelled, including Ken Clarke and Final Say supporters Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah, Jo Johnson, Philip Lee and Anna Soubry.The fresh setback for the prime minister came as she put herself on another collision course with Brussels, after toughening her stance on the Irish border backstop.The government accepted a backbench amendment that could give the Commons a veto over entry into the backstop – even though it would be legally bound to do so, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement.Furthermore, if the backstop is implemented, the government would have “a duty to have an agreed future relationship or alternative arrangements” with one year, so it “ceases to apply”.Both contradict the orce deal, under which the UK agreed the backstop was the default option if a trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 and that it should apply indefinitely.The move risked the EU’s wrath while being clearly designed to win over Tory MPs posed to vote down the prime minister’s deal next Tuesday.But it was immediately dismissed by one leading Brexiteer, former minister Steve Baker, who said: “This flimsy rubbish will only persuade those who have decided to be persuaded. Most of us have made our decision.”Until the Grieve defeat, Ms May was only required, after losing on her deal, to make a statement on what will happen next within 21 calendar days and then allow a vote in the Commons within seven sitting days.That subsequent motion was not expected to be amendable until Mr Grieve’s victory, last month, which meant MPs would be able to put forward their alternatives – but only for indicative votes.Before the defeat, Tory MPs raged at Mr Bercow for more than one hour, raising numerous points of order to vent their fury, in the closest the Commons comes to a riot.David Natzler, the Commons clerk and expert on parliamentary procedure, was believed to have advised Mr Bercow that the Grieve amendment should be struck out, because it clashed with standing orders.If the government does table the required motion within three working days, it could come very late on 21 January, postponing any debate until the following day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

He said: “We won’t see signicant price rises. But there is a risk of price spikes in certain food stuffs.”It came just days after Defra sources acknowledged that perishable goods such as lettuce, meat and veg could lose out.Tesco revealed it has joined other businesses in stockpiling goods in case of a No Deal Brexit.Chief executive Dave Lewis confirmed that sensible planning for Brexit is currently underway.Bu the admitted that it could be hard to contingency for fresh food, where we cant stockpile.A no-deal British departure from the European Union means leaving without formal arrangements for the future relationship.Currently Britains trade, customs and immigration rules are tied up with the single market and a host of EU regulatory bodies.Ministers are seeking a legal deal to replace these with looser arrangements so we are outside the single market and customs union but keeping close ties so cross-border trade is easy.Theresa May needs to get a deal through parliament ahead of the UKs exit on March , .Some fear these talks could collapse without a deal agreed before the deadline.This could mean the UK being treated as a third country by the EU with commerce governed by World Trade Organisation rules.Fears chlorine-washed chicken being imported to the UK after Brexit have got Brits in a flap.In America, poultry is treated with antimicrobial rinses to prevent harmful bacteria - and some believe British supermarkets would be forced to stock them under a US trade deal.But health campaigners argue that the use of chlorine to decontaminate chicken encourages sloppy standards during the processing stage in abattoirs.According to the Adam Smith Institute, washing chickens in a chlorine dioxide solution reduces salmonella from  per cent to two per cent - EU chickens usually have  to  per cent."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000460734272.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"fatuous mps make no deal brexit worse","story":"He has, he says, decided not to accept your price after all. He knows it is your final one and there won’t be any more forthcoming. But don’t worry. He has passed a motion. And the motion is clear. He completely rules out failing to do a deal with you.I have attended many boring political meetings and witnessed many fatuous ­political acts. Student meetings, tiny party branch meetings, national executive ­meetings of failing political parties, cabinet meetings of governments heading towards landslide defeats.And in all that time I have never ­participated in, indeed never witnessed, anything quite as fatuous or fruitless as voting to insist that we won’t leave the European Union without a deal. It’s not that I’m calm about the prospect of leaving without a deal. Or that I’m willing to support doing so.It’s just that not having a deal cannot be stopped by saying: “I’m against not having a deal”. It can only be stopped by ­agreeing to one.The Tory Nicky Morgan and Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn joined ­forces on Tuesday to make it harder for the Government to let Britain leave the EU without a deal. Their motion was backed by a majority of MPs. But it still has three fairly obvious shortcomings.First, the Government isn’t in favour of leaving the EU without a deal. It agrees there shouldn’t be “no deal”. It has a deal. It is in favour of passing its deal. Second, the Government doesn’t need to be reminded about the damaging ­consequences of leaving without a deal.It knows what they are. Making it harder to prepare doesn’t make the ­Government keener to avoid no deal, because it’s keen to do that already.The third point is the most important one. Among those who argue that no deal must be avoided, there appears little agreement on what the alternative might be. The main sponsors of yesterday’s footling motion in the Commons are admirably open-minded but appear to have no idea how to win the majority of MPs around to their open-mindedness.I suppose these anti-no-dealers think they are warning Theresa May that,her deal is defeated next week, she has to come up with something . But this advice is only sensiblethere is an obvious alternative that stands a ­better chance of passing the Commons. Come on, really, what is that I’ll make a personal point at this stage. I believe that the referendum produced a legitimate outcome that Parliament has a duty to implement. It would be a grotesque failurewe were not able to arrange to leave.I’ve been against a second referendum all along. But even so, I insist that the departure should be orderly. I’m not ­willing to support a calamitous crashing-out, evenit means accepting the shame of failing to implement Brexit.Yet what do the anti-no-dealers offer to someone like me, who ought to be one of their natural supporters  Nothing except the frivolous message that they, too, are against no deal. And a perverse deter­mination to make an ­accidental no deal even worse than it might otherwise be.In those circumstances the only sensible position for me is to back the Prime ­Minister’s deal and urge Morgan, Cooper and Benn to do the same. Let’s look at the options once Mrs May’s deal is defeated in the Commons vote, as it seems it will be.There is the idea that she might be defeated in a no-confidence motion, lose the ensuing election and be replaced by a Corbyn government that negotiates a new deal. Except that a successful no-confidence motion is highly unlikely and there certainly won’t be a new deal, evenLabour got into power.By the way, the Labour Party is now toying with fighting an election, proposing a renegotiation with Brussels which would be followed by a public vote. In this vote, would they back leaving the EU  Or are they seriously suggesting they renegotiate a deal which they then urge voters to reject by recommending we stay in the EU after all Brussels would ­certainly want that. So you would have two sides negotiating a withdrawal ­agreement that both hope would fail. I think we can safely scrub that one off the list of sensible ideas.Next, there is the option of arranging to remain in the single market, in a Norway-style arrangement. This would require support from the Labour front bench to succeed because a lot of Tories would oppose it, evenMrs May agreed to it. But Labour has ­repeatedly resisted this idea. At the moment, a Norway-style deal stands less chance of success than Mrs May’s deal.A more realistic option is that ­Parliament supports a permanent customs union. Shortly after next week’s vote, members of the House of Lords will ­consider the Trade Bill.Peers will almost certainly pass an amendment to the bill, allowing Britain to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU. That creates a showdown in the Commons, where it is quite possible, given the strength of support, that the ­Government would have to agree.This would cause turbulence in the ­Government but, crucially, it would allow Labour to support Mrs May’s dealit wanted to — and to get it through the ­Commons. However, I doubt very much that it will want to. Labour only supports a customs union in which we get to decide on trade deals, which is not on the table.Then, of course, there is the possibility of delaying Brexit with or without a ­second referendum. Labour is still ­resisting this option and,it backs it at all, might do so in a form which is impossible to implement, such as ­insisting its own renegotiateddeal be on the ballot paper.In these circumstances, the chance of us accidentally ending up with no deal is very large. It is irresponsible to hinder any preparations we may need to make.We should be thinking harder about how to manage it. What side-deals do we need on things like air travel  Is there any way of agreeing a short transition   What physical preparations are in place Passing motions against such measures is worse than foolish — it’s positively reckless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not just Leavers. Most Remainers do too.They accepted their referendum defeat with a grace that would shame Tories like Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry, and most of Labour’s MPs,they had enough humility to feel it.Yesterday Bercow let the Commons vote, without debate, to force Theresa May to produce a Brexit “Plan B” in three working daysand when her deal is rejected next Tuesday. The aim is to swtly paint her into a ­corner from which her only escape is the second referendum Remainers optimistically believe would reverse Brexit.Bercow, supposedly the gatekeeper of our ancient Commons procedures, defied his officials’ advice and tore up the rule book to make this happen.Why  Because this supposedly unbiased Speaker deludes himself, like the Remain diehards whose dirty work he enables, that he is the dashing hero of a noble anti-Brexit ­insurgency .That’s right: the first “rebellion” to take back control for London’s rich, europhile establishment elite from a public that demanded change and was promised it by these very same politicians.Bercow has violated the impartiality of a historic office which he still holds solely because Remainers disgracefully ignored serious bullying allegations against him to secure his help.But equally dishonourable are those Tories whose weird religious devotion to the EU would now see them sacrice their own Prime Minister, Government, party and — more importantly — the ­stability of our democracy and country.The same goes for Corbyn’s MPs, who lie about honouring the Leave votes of millions of Labour supporters but would reject ANY deal Mrs May produced for one reason: it would mean leaving the EU.We hope the constituents this dismal rabble are busy betraying will make amends whenever an election is called.As for John “B****cks to Brexit” ­Bercow, his prejudices have skewed his judgment, fatally compromised his role, are directly hindering Brexit and have cost him the trust of half the Commons.Time’s up.A BOY of  butchered in the street. Parts of London looking like a Mexican drug-war zone. What’s the Mayor doing about it Or is he too busy banning fast food ads, blowing millions on fireworks promoting the EU or vacuously boasting “London Is Open”, asit would ever close PR opportunities are all that interest Sadiq Khan.

And they are cock-a-hoop, ready to reject Theresa May’s deal and enforce some even worse version, so absurdly soft as to be meaningless.It would be a near-perfect result for Remain diehards . . . a non-Brexit to suit the referendum’s losers while flicking a sneering, Geldof-style V-sign at the hapless .million winners they despise.Don’t like it  Suck it up, as Remainer Anna Soubry would say.

A supersoft Brexit will solve nothing.It will simply pour fuel on the flames — and finally flush the public’s faith in our Parliament and mainstream politicians down the sewer.NO wonder economic migrants chance their arm on a perilous and illegal dinghy voyage across the Channel when we are so woefully incompetent at kicking them back out.What is the point of our asylum process at allless than half those whose applications and appeals fail are sent home  Even the man previously running Home Office immigration enforcement knows it to be a shambolic disgrace.Some “refugees” now endure a -mile crossing from Belgium to Lincolnshire to dodge patrols.

But the remarkable thing about this row is that it will be based on the assumption that Theresa May has already lost this vote — and lost big.No one is pretending that May is going to win on ­Tuesday night. From No  to the Cabinet, everyone admits that it is lost. The optimists think the right amendments can keep the ­margin of defeat down to ­double digits, but that is as far as their expectations go.The row will be about what to do once the Government has lost. One faction in the Cabinet believes that, in the words of one secretary of state, “the only realistic route to go down is to force it into the EU’s hands”.This would involve devising a motion that made clear under what conditions Parliament would back the deal. Then saying to the EU: If you want to avoid No Deal, this is what we need to address.One Cabinet minister who supports this approach says: “They don’t have the agility or the time to construct that for Tuesday. But they should devise it for ten days’ time and bung it over to Europe.”But another group of Cabinet ministers thinks May can only pass a deal with “signicant Labour support” and so she should invite Jeremy ­Corbyn in for talks after defeat on Tuesday.One champion of this approach tells me: “If she does it well, she can make him take some responsibility.” This secretary of state ­concedes, though, that they don’t know whether May will do this or not, saying: “She is like a train on one track. She doesn’t know how to move.” So, what will Mrs May do Well, one of the few, who can claim to know her mind, tells me: “If the votes won’t come from the Tories, they have to come from Labour. What are the conditions for that going to be ”In other words, vote down this deal and Brexit only gets softer. No  is also deeply pessimistic about getting much more out of the EU than it is already doing. So, May is highly unlikely to go down the route of asking Parliament to show the EU what kind of deal it would agree to.At Cabinet this week, May tolerated some discussion of what would happen next. “No customs union, no second ­referendum. That’s the core for her,” reports one of those present. But will May hold the line on a customs union when that is Labour’s biggest single demand May’s deal is flawed. How could it not be, given the ­failure to prepare properly for No Deal, which has so weakened the UK’s negotiating position, and the loss of the Tory ­majority in Parliament which has hobbled Mrs May But the reality is thatthis deal doesn’t pass, Brexit will only be weakened. The Government doesn’t want No Deal and doesn’t think it could get it through this ­Parliament evenit did.That means it will soften the deal to try to get Commons support for it.The danger for Brexiteers is that voting against this deal could make it worse, not better.EVERY Tory MP needs to remember that a Jeremy Corbyn government would do huge damage to the United Kingdom.Privately, a growing number of Tory MPs who are passionately opposed to No Deal are flirting with the idea of bringing down the Government to stop it,necessary. This would make a Corbyn premiership almost inevitable.Now, No Deal would be disruptive and, given how late in the day the Government has left serious contingency planning, that disruption would be damaging to the UK and its reputation.But this pales into insignicance compared to what a Corbyn government would mean. Labour’s plan to make companies with more than  employees hand over ten per cent of their shares to their workers would do huge damage to the UK’s reputation for respecting property rights.It would contribute to massive capital flight from the UK and inflict lasting damage on the UK as a place in which to do business and invest.But the economic damage that a Corbyn government would do wouldn’t be the half of it. Would our closest allies, led by the United States, really carry on sharing the most sensitive intelligence with us with Corbyn in charge I doubt it. Once unwound, the level of security co-operation between Britain and the other members of the Five Eyes security group would be impossible to put back together.Risking Corbyn becoming PM because you are worried about No Deal is like amputating your leg to prevent your toes getting frostbite.So, let’s consider the events of the past week. The governing parties in Italy have sent messages of solidarity to the Yellow Vests in France, a group who want to remove the French President from office.Italy itself may well already be in recession and with industrial output falling sharply in Germany, even the powerhouse of the eurozone might be going that way.This is a reminder that it would be deeply ignorant to blame every bit of bad economic news on Brexit and that the EU’s problems have not gone away.AT a private meeting with Tory MPs on Wednesday night, Sajid Javid again made clear that he’s a very dferent Home Secretary from Theresa May.Talking about the rise in violent crime, Javid said: “Sadly, we’ve seen a drop in stop-and-search”, before talking about how its use was now increasing again.This was a clear attempt to distance himself from the Prime Minister. For who was more responsible than anyone  for the decline in use of stop-and-search, than the then Home Secretary Mrs May Javid’s comments will do little for the already badly strained relations between the Home Office and No .ORDER is close to breaking down completely in the Commons chamber.Tory MPs are so outraged by Speaker John Bercow’s behaviour that there is a real danger of them simply refusing to accept his authority.On Tuesday’s big vote, there will be a series of amendments – some of which will be designed to help the Government, others not.One influential member of the Government warns that “ he’s openly partisan in his amendment selections then I think there’ll be uproar and he could lose the House”.One secretary of state warns that in these circumstances you could have “ MPs stand up and completely disobey him”. If this happened, Bercow would either have to suspend the session or start chucking Tory MPs out of the chamber.Is it really feasible to have the Speaker eject scores of MPs ahead of one of the most important parliamentary votes in decades The flagrancy with which Bercow has changed the rules leaves him vulnerable to Tory MPs deciding that they, too, are going to flout convention and refuse to sit down when he tells them to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Cave in to Remainers further, for example over a permanent customs union tying us to the EU forever, and the Government is kaput.The PM’s only solution after defeat on Tuesday is toimmediately to Brussels, preferably with DUP chief Arlene Foster, and tell the EU it’s now or never for a legally-binding assurance on the Irish backstop.It should be enough for the DUP and maybe Tory eurosceptics faced with the real threat of Brexit never happening.Here’s a stark reminder for delusional Cabinet europhiles:When they triggered Article  they voted for the possibility of No Deal, however unpalatable they now consider it. They also backed a binding referendum and a Tory manesto promising to leave the single market and customs union.And they should remember this: their own anti-Brexit prejudices do not matter a damn. What DOES is the Leave verdict of the .million majority and most Tory voters and members.If this Remainer-stuffed Government nullies or destroys Brexit they can kiss goodbye to their jobs and their party.They will have gted everything, our economy and our national security, to Corbyn’s anti-western Marxist rabble. Britain will never forgive them.OUR economy may be slowing a little . . . but the eurozone is in meltdown.Germany, its powerhouse, is close to recession.

because it would smooth the path and lessen the worry for those who do any form of business with the EU or are simply holidaymakers.Project Fear may not be true but it has made people fret, which is irresponsible on behalf of its progenitors and a pity for those affected.  More importantly, it is better for the UK to depart on friendly rather than hostile terms.Leaving the EU is not about dislike of our European neighbours, it is about escaping from a failed economic model and reasserting democratic control over the nation’s future.  It makes sense to depart in a way that maintains as much friendship as possible.Whatever happens, the European Union will remain an important economic partner and market on many international issues the UK and the EU will continue to have similar objectives and personal friendships and inter-connections will remain.  A deal would help ease all of this and even be worth making a modest payment for.This does not mean that the UK ought to fear leaving without the current Withdrawal Agreement or any potential alternative.  The recent Today Programme interview with Mr Puissesseau, the President of the Calais port and Deputy Mayor, removed the major plank of the Project Fear structure.Almost all the risks are predicated on the Dover–Calais route becoming gridlocked, stopping food, common medicines and components coming through although, the idea that just-in-time delivery requires the EU is ridiculous it is used in many non-EU countries across their international borders.  Mr Puissesseau said this will not happen.  He even complained that the preparations being made for it were disrespectful to Calais and that no extra delays would be imposed.  Amusingly, the interview was set up and introduced to provide the opposite answer and the tape is worth listening to for the discomfiture of the official BBC view.In addition to goods continuing to flow, under a No-Deal departure, the British taxpayer would save £billion, money that could be used to cut taxes, to help our domestic economy and leave plenty to help any exporters who face particularly high tarfs.The advantages of Brexit would come through sooner with trade barriers going down in  instead of , which could see the cost of food, clothing and footwear fall sharplythe Government were to follow sensible policies.  This particularly helps the least well off in society.Trade is helped by an absence of barriers, be they tarf or regulatory ones.  The EU specialises in erecting barriers for a fortress Europe.  Leaving without a trade deal under WTO rules would allow us to look to the rest of the world sooner and open up opportunities.  There really is nothing to fear but fear itself.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I thought it sounded like a disease. It made me scared.“I didn’t know what everybody was being so serious about. So what’s a referendum then ”“It sounds like a Pokemon move,” says Cyrus confidently.Layla Thompson, eight, from Newton Ayclfe, Co Durham, adds: “It’s a football match between London and the rest of the country, I think.”Next, the kids are asked who is in charge of Brexit.When shown a picture of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Cyrus says: “I think he’s like a ­person from Harry Potter who’s just had a laughing spell put on him.”James adds: “He’s a scary old man,” while Oliver says: “I think he’s on ­Britain’s Got Talent.”Clover Cooper, six, from Darlington, suggests: “The TV ­sometimes has people at the bottom of the screen that do actions and he’s one of those.”The Prime Minister is a little more recognisable to the group, who are shown a video of her dancing on to the stage at the Tory Party conference last year.Cyrus says: “I have seen her on the news, it’s Theresa May. If she walked in right now I’d roast her because of her dance moves. She’d probably trip on the chairs.”Kaci Jo Bell, six, from Middlesbrough, adds: “She’s walking so funny, it looks like she’s about to fall over. Is she a clown  I think I’d get on with her.”When Marnie Harper, six, from Middlesbrough, is asked who her dream Prime Minister would be, she says: “My dad! He is my favourite person and he is bossy.”James ­suspects Donald Trump is at the heart of Brexit and says: “I think he’s in charge.“I’ve seen him on the news. He looks like he’s trying to be good but he’s naughty most of the time. Sometimes there are ­accidents. He doesn’t do them but other people ask himhe’s done it and he ­sometimes says yes and sometimes no.”Nine-year-old Ava Hancock, from Newton Ayclfe, says: “I thought he looked a bit orange.”Cyrus says: “When I saw Donald Trump on the news I thought about his wig and how it did not look like actual hair, even though he tried to make it look like hair.“Also, he looked like a chicken on an advert, you know, when they make a chicken nice and golden.”Next, the kids are asked who they’d like to take charge of Brexit.Clover says: “The giant from Jack And The Beanstalk, becauseanyone did do something wrong he would climb down the beanstalk and get them, so he’d be a really good Prime Minister.“Also Mr Tickle, as he has really stretchy arms and he could reach over the seathey did anything bad to us in Europe.”Kaci Jo has other ideas, saying: “I want the BFG [Big Friendly Giant, not to be confused with the ERG] in charge because he is big and he can just go and get them and shout at themthey do anything  wrong in Brussels.”This last comment baffles some of the others. “What’s Brussels ” two of them ask. Oliver reckons he knows. “It’s where Brussels sprouts for Christmas are made,” he says.Marnie is slightly off-target, saying: “Brussels  I think it’s in Germany.”Cyrus adds: “I think everybody there is green and eats sprouts and the fields are made of ­toothbrushes.”But the group seem less clued up about the signicance of March  — the day we are due to leave the EU.

Then we won’t be able to go on holiday but we’ll still be able to go to Harry Potter World and Center Parcs.”Perhaps a little optimistically, ­Clover asks: “Will it be the day everyone starts smiling again ”Cyrus adds: “I think everything will be more expensive, except food that’s homegrown, because we can get that for free.

But she has few left who would be willing to help.Her first call is likely to go to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to plead for a sweetener to boost support for her blueprint.But he is unlikely to give her any major concessions and has already warned the PM that he will not reopen negotiations — and that’s his final answer.Evenhe does agree to fresh talks, the countdown clock will not have stopped ticking and it is dficult to see what more she could squeeze out of the unyielding Eurocrat.Andshe ed from Brussels with nothing more than a few tweaks to the same old deal, the Pound would crash and there is a chance the public outcry would twist the arms of MPs to vote for the PM’s Brexit deal at the second attempt.Time is not on her side, however, and there will be pressure from some MPs to extend Article  — the two-year mechanism for leaving the EU — which ends on March .This is fraught with problems.First the UK would have to beg the EU for an extension and it could only be grantedall  member states agree.Secondly, the Government would have to change the definition of “exit day” in the Withdrawal Act, and MPs would get a vote on it.But reopening talks carries a high risk. President Emmanuel Macron would seize the chance to demand more fishing rights for France and Spanish leader Pedro Sanchez would press for more control of Gibraltar.Brexiteers would see it as a victory for Remainer MPs and the first step towards a second referendum — which would drag the country into the worst political turmoil for decades.A No source said: “If we had three more weeks, three months or even three years, it wouldn’t change the fundamentals.”And of course,the EU refused to re-enter negotiations, Mrs May would have to plump for one of the other options.But like every other way forward, MPs on all sides, from Brexit wreckers to hardline Leavers, will try to block her for their own political ends.Labour’s  MPs hold many of the cards and will make or break any effort by Parliament to drive the Government down one route or another.In the  weeks left until Britain leaves, Remainer MPs will try guerrilla tactics on an almost daily basis to try to thwart, delay or soften Brexit.And they will be the biggest stumbling blocksMrs May attempts to take us out without a deal.She has often insisted “No Deal is better than a bad deal” andnothing  happens the law is in place to dictate that Britain will leave on March . But Labour’s Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, has admitted his top priority is to stop Britain “crashing out” of the EU.He says: “No Deal is not an option. Labour will not countenance No Deal and nor would many of the Prime Minister’s own MPs.”His stand would be backed by  Scottish Nationalist MPs,  Lib Dems and some Remainer Tories.Mrs May would also face Cabinet resignationsshe attempted to leave with no agreement.A senior Government source said: “There’s no way you can cruise control towards a No-Deal Brexit. That’s for the birds.”MPs unhappy with the prospect defeated the Government this week by voting to limit the Treasury’s ability to raise certain taxes, a symbolic warning shot across the Government bows.Their nuclear option would be to call a vote of no confidence.Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, two-thirds of MPs must back the vote to force a general election, which is extremely unlikely. If the PM loses narrowly, the Tories have  days to form an alternative government that is able to win a confidence vote —not there would be an election.But the timing is such that the earliest an election could be held would be February , barely five weeks before Brexit day.Mrs May could decide the best way to break the deadlock would be to “ask the audience” — by calling a general election herself.She would get to pick the date and fight it on the grounds of winning a clear mandate for delivering Brexit.But as she learned in , the outcome is not guaranteed. And with their seats at risk and a Marxist government led by Jeremy Corbyn waiting in the wings, they are unlikely to give her that two-thirds Commons majority she needs.Which perhaps explains why the PM is sticking so doggedly to her dodgy deal. She may be staring defeat in the face but it’s got as much chance as any of the other possible options.Andanyone  tells you they know the answer to the biggest question in politics, you know they’re lying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We will be publishing it on Tuesday.But despite the threat from Remainers, top Brexiteers have doubled down on their threat to defeat the PMs withdrawal agreement.Ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis said: We know thatthe withdrawal agreement is passed, the UK will be signing away all our bargaining power, with next to nothing inand with our future status yet to be decided.His successor Dominic Raab claimed the deal suffocates the opportunities Brexit offers.The ex-PM risked anger by calling for Theresa May to revoke Article  as soon as possible.He said Britain should stay in the EU past March, and hold a second referendum to decide whether or not Brexit will happen.Writing in the Sunday Times, Sir John even claimed the result of the  vote shouldnt be respected because some Brits chose to stay home rather than casting a ballot.He said: In the midst of chaos, it is sensible to pause and think. To review all possible options and seek a majority consensus.Article  was triggered - and the deadline of March ,  was set - before we knew what we wished to do. Two years later, we still have no agreement on that.The only sensible course now is for the Government to revoke Article  and suspend any decision on departure.This may be politically uncomfortable, but any short-term political disruption pales into insignicance when compared with the long-term damage that could be wreaked on our country as a whole.He called for a second referendum to take place later this year and insisted it would be binding because all party leaders would sign up for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000460519499.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady freedom of speech not harassing mps","story":"Both are important and much cherished rights that have been fought for over the years.But something really scary is happening in this country. I’m talking about the footage of Anna Soubry being harassed and bullied in the street which has led to a man being arrested.Who would have thought we would live somewhere where people think it’s OK to aggressively call an MP a “slag” and a “Nazi” to her face — simply because she has a view that they don’t agree with.When it comes to political harassment outside Parliament, some people have suggested that women are disproportionately being targeted. I’m not sure that’s true.Journalist Owen Jones was also followed down the street in an equally bullying way.And not so long ago, Jacob Rees-Mogg was verbally attacked on his own doorstep in front of his children.The sad truth is that there is a nasty taste about politics in everyone’s mouth at the moment.And this kind of behaviour isn’t a million miles away from the way that politicians treat each other in the chamber.PMQs has become a ludicrous, abusive, screaming match full of insults and contempt. Sometimes it’s worse than that and the confrontation is pre-meditated.Not so long ago, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for Tory MPs “not to be able to show their faces in public” without being challenged by “direct action”.Since he said it, the atmosphere both inside and outside Parliament has become considerably more feverish. But the point is that some people take their lead from the way politicians treat each other.Politics should be all about serving people before you serve yourself.And there was a time when we trusted our politicians to do the right thing for the right reasons.But that trust is gone.In fact, people are becoming sick to the back teeth with politicians doing things that suit them, rather than the country.Whether we like it or not, the majority voted to leave the EU. But there is no doubt that some people feel they were misled or the terms weren’t explained to them. Andpeople were angry before the referendum, they are even angrier now.But they are going to have to find a dferent way to express it than by shouting threatening abuse in people’s faces.Politics is hard enough without fearing for your le and needing security to go to work.This country is changing — and not for the better. We have no tolerance for other people’s views, or when things don’t go the way we want them to. We all want our own way.The stakes are very high. And no one trusts their politicians to do what they want them to do in the way they want them to do it.So their response is to hunt them down and hurl abuse.It used to be that this sort of thing only happened on social media, and we all agreed it wouldn’t happen in real le. But look, it now is.People sending out this abuse should be held to account for their actions and words.Shouting in someone’s face in a threatening manner is not acceptable behaviour. It’s harassment and utterly deplorable.But also, politicians need to start building trust again. They need to say something and mean it,  and do the right things for the right reasons.I’M no stranger to criticism. And normally it’s water off a duck’s back.But I really take issue with being called a “passenger” this week, together with my friend Lord Sugar, for our attendance at the House of Lords.I want to make something very clear. Despite being a full-time CEO, I have voted in  per cent of isions, speak once a month and have never taken a penny of the daily expenses, allowances or fees. Lord Sugar, like me, does not take a single penny.People seem to misunderstand the role of the peers in the House of Lords. For a start, quantity has never equalled quality. But also, we do not implement legislation.We use our le skills and experience to help draft legislation and improve it by suggesting amendments that make the bills work better in the “real world”.Our second priority is to hold the Government to account by questioning ministers, seeking information and debating government policy.We also debate issues. In the Organ Donation debate I spoke in recently, contributors included a board member of patient groups, a surgeon, the chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons, a medical professor, a doctor and one of the heads of NHS Blood and Transplant – all of whom also happen to be peers making valuable contributions to help government work better.So I don’t like being called a passenger, because it’s wrong. The reason I am a peer is I want to try to help make the world a better place. That is my only motivation to be part of the House of Lords.So I’m a bit annoyed that Lord Sugar and I are being picked on because we are on the telly.We need peers to have real-world experience and make their contribution, which Lord Sugar and I do.We do it for free and we will keep doing so. And we will do so proudly.EEK! The Channel  show Shut-Ins: Britain’s Fattest People made for some seriously disquieting viewing on Wednesday.It’s hard for the average viewer to understand how someone could allow themselves to become so obese that they are bed-bound.Harder for me to understand is the people in that position who allow their children to become their carers.I know it’s not easy to lose weight and keep it off, but asking your eight-year-old to look after you is not only ruining your own le, but hers too.What child should be the main carer for their obese mother WHEN I read the break-up statement from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, , and his novelist we, MacKenzie, earlier this week I was struck by how impressive it was.“If we had known we would separate after  years, we would do it all again,” the statement read.The couple wished each other well with no regrets and it sounded like the near-perfect separation.And then, the next day, came the news that photos of Bezos and the woman he has allegedly been having an affair with for the past eight months were about to be published.So I guess he jumped before he was pushed, as it were.How disappointing.I WATCHED a really disturbing clip this week of a hooligan sneaking up to a sleeping homeless man in Leeds and – to impress some of his yobbish mates – blasting a really loud air horn in his ear.It’s one of the most disgusting acts I have seen in a while.Tormenting those less fortunate than you and picking on them because you consider them worthless is the lowest of the low.Many people living on the street have addiction or mental health problems. Treating both is important.But just as important is treating all people with dignity.EQUALLY as shocking was the story about three men who attacked two others walking along London’s South Bank, apparently because they were holding hands.This blatant homophobia feels archaic – and needs to stop.I hope when the pathetic perpetrators are found they get more than a telling off and a caution.ANYONE  stle a yawn reading about writer Yann Moix, who said in an interview this week that he finds women of  “too old”.The Frenchman continued: “I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of.“The body of a -year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of  is not extraordinary at all.”Apparently Yann would be “incapable” of loving a woman aged  or above – despite being  himself.Let’s face it, any body belonging to a -year-old – male or female – is probably not what it was at .So since he seems to be talking only about attraction, not love, why on earth he thinks a woman of  will want to look at his body is anyone’s guess.But also, who would want to be with someone as superficial as this APPARENTLY, Wayne Rooney has been banned by we Coleen from leaving the house without her following his drunken arrest at a US airport.Ex-Manchester United star Rooney, , who now plays for Washington’s DC United in the US, was arrested for public intoxication on December  at the city’s Dulles International Airport.The former England captain received a furious phone call from Coleen, who apparently yelled at him: “How many times do you need to be told ”Oh dear.

The full might of the British establishment has joined forces to overthrow the biggest democratic vote in our history.Together, they have strived to stop this country becoming truly independent once more. They have fought with the passion of true, eye-swivelling believers to keep us shackled to Brussels.AndTheresa May sees her deal voted down on Tuesday — and it looks like she is on course to suffer a defeat of historic proportions — they will take a great leap forward to achieving their goal.Oh, it will be dressed up and prettied to pretend that democracy still s in this country.There will be much prattle about “going back to the people” with another referendum. There will be talk about a “delay” in leaving the EU. It will all be meaningless flannel.The British elite wants to keep us inside the European Union. They are succeeding. Jolly well done, chaps.Never mind that a British Prime Minister, the coward David Cameron, looked us in the eye and told us our decision in the referendum was final.Never mind that the over- whelming majority of MPs in the House of Commons voted to trigger Article  and take us out of the EU.Never mind that at the General Election, both the major political parties stood on manestos that promised to honour the result of the referendum.Lies.

The masters are taking back control of a people’s rebellion.But should we not all reflect for a moment on the consequences of Parliament’s break with the people There is currently no  for political extremists in this country, not the way that there is in European nations such as Germany, Spain, France and Greece.Historically, the British have never cared for the loony fringe extremism that has flourished — and frequently ruled — in other European nations.But I fear the democracy deniers of the British establishment are creating the perfect conditions for the rise of the nutters.WE DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY.There were ugly scenes outside Westminster this week. Name calling, bullying and aggression. All of us should be striving to see it does not get far worse.The .million who voted for Brexit are not — and never have been — the knuckle-dragging morons of myth.Deny Brexit and they will not suddenly become violent thugs. But there are lunatics on the margins of our society who will feel enabled by an arrogant establishment recklessly and openly breaking with the democratic will of the British people.How can you not fear for our country’s future “LONDON is open,” preened London Mayor Sadiq Khan in his lavish, pro-Brussels fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.Yes, Sadiq – open for violence, open for gangs, open for murder.Two weeks into , London has already had four murders, including the killing of Jaden Moodie, a boy of  who was rammed off a moped, then repeatedly stabbed by three men.London had  murders in , many of them teenagers.Khan needs to stop posing and start getting some effective policing on the streets of our capital.THERE is one thing I truly don’t understand about the malcontents who spend their lives flying balloons, waving flags and raising their voices around Parliament Square.The UK employment rate is now at . per cent, an all-time high.

It is a sad state of affairs when you have to be brave to speak out against anti-Semitism.”Anyone who thought that Rachel was just a TV cutie smiling bravely while she spelled out words like “orgasmed”, “gobshite” and “bumhole”has seriously underestimated her.Rachel Riley has courage, grace and eloquence.

Cristina Calafateanu says she and husband Liviu suffered diarrhoea and severe stomach cramps just three days into their week-long stay in Egypt. When she ed to the UK she was diagnosed with bacterial infection shigella – before medics told her the illness had triggered a form of arthritis. Six months after their trip, Cristina, , says the agonising pain in her joints has left her still unable to get around unsupported.  She said: “I was stunned – no one should be faced with falling ill during their honeymoon.I can’t believe what’s happened, I feel I deserve answers – and justice –regarding how this illness developed. “Our honeymoon was meant to be memorable for very obvious reasons. “Now we’ll only remember it because of these problems.”  The couple wed in May last year and checked in to the all-inclusive five-star Baron Palace Sahl Hasheesh, in Hurghada, in July after booking through Thomas Cook. Within days, they say, both fell ill. Cristina, of Maidstone, Kent, said: “It was awful, we were both struggling for the rest of the holiday. “While Liviu slowly started to feel better, I still had incredibly painful stomach cramps. He had no option but to take me to AE when we got back.”  Doctors at Maidstone Hospital diagnosed infectious gastroenteritis. Tests later confirmed the cause was shigella, often passed on through poor food hygiene. But as she began to recover, Cristina developed horric joint pains. She was diagnosed with reactive arthritis, a known complication, and was readmitted to hospital for nine days as her mobility deteriorated.   Cristina said: “I was in absolute agony and could barely walk. When the doctors said my illness had caused arthritis I was in a state of disbelief. “I wasn’t able to climb the stairs, so Liviu brought my mattress down for me. I couldn’t stand, or walk anywhere – I felt like such a burden on him. “We had to buy my mother a plane ticket from Romania to come to England to look after me.” Cristina, who works in quality control, has since been unable toto work. She and Liviu, , who say they ate only at the hotel, have instructed law firm Irwin Mitchell’s to take up the case. Jatinder Paul, acting for the couple, said: “We’re very concerned. This is a truly shocking and upsetting incident. “What was meant to be a holiday of a letime became a nightmare. We are determined to help them gain answers.”  Thomas Cook, which operates the hotel along with other tour firms, said: “We’ve not received this claim yet but we’ll look into it with the hotel to make sure they are maintaining the high standards our customers expect.” In a separate case last year John Cooper, , and his we Susan, , died while staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada. John, of Burnley, Lancs, was found dead in his room. Susan died in hospital six hours later. Thomas Cook, which operated the hotel, evacuated guests after tests showed high levels of E.coli and the staphylococcus bacteria.

Carl Austin-Behan and husband Simon are expecting a girl in March after conceiving with a lesbian couple who are also their close friends. The foursome have admitted its an unusual set-up but are thrilled they will be one big family with their daughter splitting her time between the two couples homes. Carl, former Mr Gay UK and the first openly gay Lord Mayor of Manchester, and partner Simon decided it would be the best option for them rather than going down the surrogacy route, or the mums conceiving via sperm donation. And, after several attempts with a home fertilisation kit, the foursome found out they were expecting a baby girl.  Carl and Simon both made sperm donations to be fertilised, meaning neither know who the biological father is. Legally, only two people can be named as parents on a birth certicate so one member of each couple will be named on the document. Carl, , admits its an unconventional family but says their little daughter will be cared for and showered with love like any other child in a happy home. “It is an unusual set-up, admitted Carl, who served as Lord Mayor between  and , and is now LGBT advisor to Andy Burnham. But everything is amicable and weve all agreed how we want it to work. “Simon and I are going to play as much a crucial part in the baby’s le as her mums are. Our baby will have two mummies and two daddies, and thats how we want it to be.  Carl and Simon, who have been together for  years, did start the adoption process but paused their application when Carl became Lord Mayor in . The couple eventually decided adoption wasnt for them and started to consider other options. The conversation with the now mums-to-be, who have asked not be named, came up at a friends wedding. The couples were friends of old and often socialised together. But they didnt consider shared parenthood seriously until the girls got married in . Carl said the couples had similar values and a shared vision of how they wanted to raise a child. We approached them about having a baby between us, and they were up for it, said Carl. It progressed into proper conversations about how we wanted it to work. We talked about having two mummies and two daddies, and the fact that we all have busy lives and that we all enjoy our lives. “But we didn’t think that that should stop us having a child. We know how we’re going into it and we’re all going to be responsible. “Everything is going to be split equally, so it’s dual parenting.”  A legal document has been drawn up as part of shared agreement between the couples should their situations change as their daughter grows up. You have to be very open and honest with each other, Carl added. “We’ve talked about her growing up, how much TV can she watch, how much time will she be allowed on the tablet, do we breastfeed, do we bottle feed. We’ve had all those discussions over the last  months. “We’ve done everything to make sure when she comes into this world she knows she’s loved by all four of us.” When the baby is born in March she will initially stay at the girls house in Salford. Carl and Simon will stay at the house too to allow them plenty of bonding time. The baby will start staying at Carl and Simons house in Didsbury when all four parents feel the timing is right. She’s going to have a bedroom at both houses, said Carl. As she grows up, she’ll have holidays with us and holidays with them. Weve got spare rooms set up at each other houses so we all have somewhere to stay.  Carl, who also runs his own cleaning business, has been a vocal LGBT rights campaigner for many years after being dismissed from the RAF for being gay. He hopes to broaden the conversation about LGBT parenthood by sharing his story. Like many people, Carl knew from a young age that he wanted children of his own. But growing up as a young gay man at a time when homophobia and discrimination were re, becoming a parent has not always seemed possible. “From an early age I have always wanted children, says Carl. To have someone that will carry your name and your legacy. That person will be your joy, your happiness, your love. “I’ve always thought it would be nice to have a child that is part of me, part of Simon and part of our family.”  He admits their family plans have been met with some scepticism along the way but Carl says hes happy to talk about it with anyone. “One of the things I’m really proud about is by doing this, having two mummies and two daddies, it could start the conversation or debate for other people who think ‘you know what, I could do that’. “We’re not doing it for the sake of doing it. The reason why I’m being so open about it is because I’m happy to have that dialogue and open debate. I’m happy for people to challenge me, to contest what we’re doing. At the same time, how can you contest giving love for a baby who’s going to be our daughter and a part of us  “I’m not saying she’s not going to be spoilt. She’s going to be part of a big family, and she’ll be very much loved. “It quite rare what we’re doing butit means someone stops me in the street to ask about it and wants to get more information, that’s only an advantage. That’s how we’ve moved on, by having conversations.” "},{"url":null,"title":"incredible 1000 wedding deal includes","story":"NewsCheapest wedding ever  Incredible £, package includes service, food and flowersSt Johns Church in Hartford, Cheshire, is trying to help couples out - with the average cost of a wedding in the UK now around £,ShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsSt Johns Church in Hartford, Cheshire, is offering the amazing package deal on three dates\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA church is offering an incredible pound wedding package deal which includes the ceremony, a two-tiered wedding cake, digital photographs, invitations, catering and flowers.

The former London cabbie, who was jailed after attacking  women, reportedly receives regular fan letters and love notes from men and women around the world. Worboys reportedly boasted to inmates the women writing to him claim they want to meet him when he is out of prison and some even say they want to marry him. The serial rapist also claimed he is offered money to help him out and support for when he is released. The former stripper from Rotherhithe, south east London, has reportedly said they send him the letters telling Worboys they find him very attractive.  The -year-old is currently serving an indefinite prison sentence with a minimum term of eight years at Wakefield Prison in Yorkshire. A prison source said Worboys claims he is gets letters from the USA and Australia but the numbers have been exaggerated, the Daily Star reports. The unnamed prison worker said: Worboys says he gets around  letters a month and the majority of which are women. He said people as far as the US and Australia have heard of him and write to him, like it’s somehow impressive. Worboys was found guilty of  offences on  dferent women and sentenced after a trial at Croydon Crown Court.  Police believe Worboys could be behind around  more attacks after picking up women in his cab and allegedly drugging them with spiked champagne. Worboys, who changed his name to John Radford, has continued to deny involvement in any other offences. In November, police said Worboys will remain behind bars for at least another two years and could be charged with new sex offences. A parole board decision last January had ruled Worboys could be released after showing positive reactions to psychological assessments. But public outcry led to him being told he would remain behind bars after two of his victims appealed against the decision. The black cab driver is reportedly now being considered for a transfer to a lower category prison, according to The Sun.  A source said he is moaning about being kept locked up saying he has served his time and should be released. The paper also reports Worboys could be moved from the hospital wing after an operation last year once he has recovered but that plans are said to be in place to move him to a lesser security jail. It is reported prison psychiatrists have ruled he is not regarded as an escape risk or a danger to inmates. Worboys claimed his fans have backed the original parole decision in  also telling fellow prisoners they believe he has served enough to and should be let out. The politan Police interviewed Worboys last July on suspicion of further offences and a case file has been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service to review the evidence.

Supporters have been urged to tamper with Kate Middletons favourite products at supermarkets across Britain. The sick post on Telegram, an extremist website, urged followers to put poison in food and comments discussed methods to carry out the vile attack. Prince George was also featured in another post on the site pictured with his father, Prince William, alongside a masked ISIS member carrying a kne. The photo appeared next to the words: Rise of the kuffar. Kuffar translated into English means unbeliever.  Pictures on the plot to target Kate showed her shopping and had been altered with a red cross over the image and a caption: We know what she eats - poison it!Security services are said to be taking the post very seriously, a source told the Daily Star.The posts, which appear on the heavily encrypted website, also discussed which supermarkets the Duchess uses as well as detailing how to put poison into products. Kate, , most recently surprised shoppers at Christmas by shopping at discount store The Range in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, close to the Sandringham Estate where she spent some of the festive season. She has also been seen stocking up on groceries at a Waitrose supermarket in Norfolk – which is believed to be one the stores mentioned by ISIS fanatics on the Telegram site as a poisoning target.  Also in the firing line is a Waitrose near Kensington Palace, where Kate now lives at Apartment A with William, , and their children Prince George, five, Princess Charlotte, three, and eight-month-old Prince Louis.The hate message was posted on the same site used by Islamic State supporter Husnain Rashid to call on his followers to kill Prince George. Former mosque teacher Rashid, , is now serving le in jail over the plot. He also urged fanatics in some of the staggering , hate messages he sent on encrypted sites to poison tubs of ice cream in supermarkets across Britain. The Telegram instant messaging app has military grade encryption and was described as a “tool kit for terrorism” during Rashid’s trial.  Our source said: “Intelligence agents believe the threats made against Kate are not idle and are linked to messages sent by Husnain Rashid. “It’s a disgusting plot as it involves Kate’s young children, and hits out at her attempt to live a normal le like any mother wants to.” The source added that all messages posted on Telegram are traced and monitored.They said: “This is not run of the mill Twitter trolling. They are messages that are exchanged globally between jihadis that are often erased very quickly detailing attack plans.“The fact Husnain Rashid was jailed over his involvement on it shows how seriously it is taken.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle wasnt invited kate","story":"NewsMeghan Markle wasnt invited to Kate Middletons birthday bash amid rt rumoursClose family and friends were invited to an intimate lunch at Anmer Hall - but there were two noticeable absentees in Prince Harry and MeghanShareCommentsByLuke Kenton:,  JAN NewsReports suggest Meghan Markle may not have been invited to Kates birthday bash \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs rumours of a rt between Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton continue to circulate, new reports suggest the Duchess of Sussex didn’t receive an invite to her sister-in-laws birthday party last week. Kate Middleton turned  last weekend, and she celebrated the occasion with an intimate Sunday Lunch for family and friends at their Anmer Hall home, in Sandringham.But there were two noticeable absentees at the table, according to the Mail Online .Prince Harry and Meghan were nowhere to be seen.   A number of close friends attended the party, including Kate’s former hockey-pal and godmother to Prince George, Emilia Jardine-Paterson. And the Sussex’s absence has raised questions and fuelled the already re speculation the couples don’t see eye-to-eye. The Duchesses were described as “two very dferent characters” this week, with one TV commentator suggesting Kate feels threatened by Meghan.Broadcaster and journalist Carole Malone said: “Kate is the quintessential English Rose. She went to private schools, she was never a feminist in the way Meghan is she was never outspoken. “Meghan on the other hand is a driven girl. She came from a totally dferent kind of family. “It was dysal, her parents were orced and Meghan had to strive for everything that she got, so they are two very dferent characters.”  The idea that Kate fears being upstaged by Meghan could explain her apparent absence from the invite list - but latest reports suggest the pair are actually working through their dferences. On Christmas Day at the Queens Sandringham estate, the sisters-in-law are said to have bonded over board games, and even teamed-up to play Scrabble. “If German and British troops could put their dferences to one side to play football during World War One, the feeling was Kate and Meghan could follow suit for Scrabble, a source reportedly said. “After watching the Queen’s speech, the board games were brought out and both women got stuck in. The insider added to The Sun : “They were chuckling along together. You wouldn’t know there was any tension between the two. It was a wonderful day and night.”The Duchess of Cambridge, , and the pregnant Duchess of Sussex, , have been at the centre of a number of reports, which claim the women are very dferent people and dont get on.Two people have told theKate was left in tears at one of Princess Charlottes bridesmaid dress fittings ahead of Meghans wedding. Rumours were further sparked by the news Meghan and Harry will no longer be moving into an apartment next door to Kate and William. They will move to the stunning Frogmore Cottage in Windsor instead, which will undergo a huge refurbishment before they move in.Prince Charles and The Queen however are said to have made it clear that any disagreement between the two duchesses must be kept out of the public eye. The two seemed to take the advice on board as they were seen looking like best friends as they arrived at the Royal Familys Christmas Day church service.   The pair were all smiles and chatted as they walked shoulder-to-shoulder, along with their husbands, in front of an adoring crowd of hundreds. All eyes were on Meghan and Kate as they made one of their first public appearances together since the claims of a fallout emerged. At one point, cameras captured the moment Meghan placed a friendly hand on Kates back as they appeared to share a joke. However, royal fans spotted another potential rt after a video emerged of Prince Harry and William, along with their other halves, leaving St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham.In the footage the Duchess of Sussex appears to turn to her brother-in-law to engage in conversation. But the future King, , seemed more focused on fixing his scarf than catching her eye. In the video he is seen fidgeting with the accessory before getting into a waiting car. And royal fans believe that Prince William may have been deliberately trying to ignore his sister-in-law.   The two Dukes have been reported to have suffered tensions in their relationship this year after William questioned Meghans suitability as his siblings we.They reportedly had a big falling out shortly after Harry announced his engagement to Meghan Markle last year.According to one of their mutual friends, Harry didnt believe his big brother was making enough effort to welcome his new fianceacute into the family.The pal said: Harry felt William wasnt rolling out the red carpet for Meghan and told him so, reports Vanity Fair .They had a bit of a fall out which was only resolved when Charles stepped in and asked William to make an effort.

The highest risk of any snowstorms is from late January and into February as forecasters warn they cannot rule out a repeat of last years disruptive Beast from the East. Most of the country could see freezing temperatures and there are fears the brutal conditions could go on for weeks,disrupt travel and pose a danger to le. Some forecasts claim up to six inches of snow could fall in parts of the UK by the end of the month, with many places seeing at least a covering.   The latest weather maps offer a glimpse into where snow could fall from late next week, although there is still some uncertainty because it is still days away. In the short-term, Saturday through Wednesday will be mostly cloudy, windy and mild with some rain at times. Things will then turn colder, increasing the risk of snow, ice and severe frost. Blustery, wintry showers are expected in north-eastern areas on Thursday, followed by gales on Friday, when parts of northern Scotland could see snow.  From then on, the rain could turn to snow almost anywhere, but particularly across northern and central areas, especially later in the period between Thursday  January and Saturday  january. The east could see snow showers during that period. The latest maps suggest snowfall along western parts of the UK in the early hours of Monday  January before spreading east. Snow could fall across a vast swathe of the UK on Tuesday  January, with coastal areas under threat on Wednesday  January.   About -cm of snow is possible across East Anglia, the Midlands and as far south as parts of Greater London and Kent by January . Maps suggest heavy snow could continue in eastern, central and southern areas on Thursday  January, with sporadic snowfall over the following days until another system hits. Long-term forecasts are predicting another bout of heavy snow from Saturday  January to Monday  January, with the worst of it expected in northern Scotland. Over the snowy period, some places in the Lake District in northern England could see up to six inchesof snow while Yorkshire could be hit by about . inchesand North Wales could see up to two inches , the Express reported.  Snow is also possible in parts of Cornwall and Devon, and Northern Ireland from late next week. In its latest long-term update, the Met Office said there are signs that colder winter weather, resulting from a sudden stratospheric warming, is on the way for the UK. It has warned of snow, ice and widespread frost. The warming started around December  and winds about  miles above the North Pole reversed form westerly to easterly around New Years Day, it said.  As a result of the sudden warming, the Met Office said, the main stratospheric polar vortex has split and been displaced across the Atlantic and Europe - a type of pattern normally seen in the spring. Unlike the ‘Beast from the East’ last year, this event is burrowing down through the atmosphere relatively slowly, the Met Office said. Deputy Chief Meteorologist, Martin Young said: “The latest forecast suggests the highest risk of any severe wintry weather is from late January and into February. Whether cold spells will be brought about by Arctic air arriving from the north or easterly flows arriving from the continent remains uncertain. “However, before this happens we expect a rather changeable and relatively mild spell over the weekend and early next week, with some rain for most of us.  “From the middle of next week, and especially during the last week of January and into early February, there is an increased likelihood of cold weather becoming established across all of the UK. This would bring an enhanced risk of snow and widespread frost almost anywhere across the UK, but particularly across northern parts. However, the cold weather may not affect the whole of the UK and it is still possible that some milder and wetter interludes will intersperse this generally cold period, especially in the south. Britons have been given an early warning after research found two-thirds have been caught out by severe weather.  The threat was announced as continental Europe is hammered by relentless snowstorms that have killed upwards of  people so far and spawned devastating avalanches.The Met Offices outlook for Wednesday  January to Friday  January reads:Cloudy skies and a spell of rain will slowly edge southeastwards on Wednesday, clearing most places by the end of the day. Behind this it will turn clearer and colder from the north by Thursday, with scattered blustery showers, becoming wintry across northern areas. Winds will be strong with a risk of gales in the north at times. Thereafter, it looks set to remain mainly cold, unsettled and sometimes windy, with any milder spells tending to be brief and associated with longer spells of rain.  The rain could turn to snow almost anywhere, but particularly across northern and central areas, especially later in this period. Some drier, brighter, quieter spells are likely, perhaps with snow showers, especially in the east. During such spells, frost could become widespread and severe. In its long-term forecast for late January and early February, the Met Office has warned of cold weather, including snow, ice and widespread frost.  This is the outlook for Saturday  January Saturday  February: During the last week of January and into early February, there is an increased likelihood of cold weather being established across all of the UK. This would bring a greater risk of snow, ice and widespread frost, particularly across northern parts of the country.

Kelly Field helped writers and shyproducers develop Sheridan’s shycharacter in the ITV drama, which started on Wednesday night. Viewers saw cleaner Sam, played by Sheridan, , bet at online casinos while struggling with a messy break-up, looking after two kids and her zero-hours contract job. Her story echoes that of mum-of-one Kelly, who had a flutter to escape her own stress, after a grievance at her former job in a residential care home led to a period of sickness.  Five years into recovery, Kelly, , is delighted Sheridan is helping shyhighlight the issue of female gambling addiction. And she has hit out at the glossy celebrity-endorsed ads used to attract women. She said: “I almost lost my le to my gambling addiction. At its height, it left me feeling suicidal. I wanted to drive my car into a tree and end it all. It was the only way out I could see. “I was so addicted to playing online fruit machines and bingo I wouldn’t eat, I wouldn’t drink. I would even take my laptop to the toilet with me so I could keep on spinning. “I hit rock bottom after blowing a pound, overdraft in under an hour. I was already thousands of pounds in debt and the frustration, anger, upset and shame overwhelmed me.  “I snapped up the bank card and started scratching away at my wrists with it. The emotions all came to the surface and I just crumbled. “I was self-harming with the card I’d just used to get myself further into debt. I was at rock bottom of a very steep spiral and I wanted out. “Luckily I was able to find the help I needed, but many don’t. “Gambling kills. I know of people who have taken their own le when they couldn’t see any other way out.” With debt collectors at her door, Sheridan’s character turns to illegal insider trading to try to win back the money she’s lost to gambling. Kelly said: “I funded my addiction by taking out credit card after credit card and maxing them all out. I got overdrafts and spent all our savings. “But people do turn to criminality. I see it all the time. “You’re so stuck in the debt and so filled with shame, you feel you can’t speak to anyone or tell anyone. “You can see why lots of people decide suicide is the best option. “When you’re in that state of shyabsolute turmoil you just can’t see how you’ll ever get help and break the shyvicious cycle.” Kelly, a waitress from St Helens, Merseyside, first logged on to an shyonline casino when she was off work with stress in .  She saw an advert for online bingo while watching TV and, after a friend told her about a dferent online shycasino, decided to give it a go. She said: “It was fun at first, and a great escape from the reality of what was going on around me. “It wasn’t about money or winning. If you do win, it feels good, so you go back on. It’s the buzz and the thrill and the bright lights, the music and the fast spin of the slots.” Despite hearing of others who had got into debt playing online casinos and bingo, Kelly thought her new hobby was just harmless fun. But she was soon addicted and hiding her habit from her partner, son and everyone around her. She said: “There are chatrooms on the sites. A message popped up from one player which read, ‘I can’t believe I’m pound, in debt.’ I was reading it, thinking, ‘How on earth do you get  grand in debt doing this ’ “But it quickly takes hold. Not even six months after my first spin I was pound, in debt and had maxed out my first credit card. Looking back, I can’t believe my bank let me keep going. “I was playing for eight hours a day, every day – hiding it from everyone – and could easily lose pound in just five seconds. It only takes a second to click, spin and lose it. “It doesn’t feel like real money. It felt like playing Sonic the Hedgehog when I was a kid, with the lives and top score at the top of the screen. “I would be losing more than pound every day, easily – sometimes more.  “I’d get up in a morning and, as soon as my partner went to work and my son went to school I’d sit all day on my laptop just spinning on the fruit machines. “I’d max out one card, then I’d apply for another one. Then another. I got so desperate I used to get into my car and think, ‘I’ll wrap myself around a tree and end it. Then it’s only me and the tree who would get hurt.’” Kelly eventually told her shypartner and found the help she needed. Since , she has been paying back her debt at pound a month and has helped other addicts recover. She said: “For someone like Sheridan Smith to portray what I’ve been through and for it to be seen on shytelevision is a huge deal. It will reach millions. She is such an icon.” Speaking about online gambling sites, Sheridan said: “A lot of gambling adverts are aimed at females in the daytime. They are pink and glossy.” Kelly agrees. She said: “I hate the adverts featuring trusted celebrities like Paddy McGuinness, who does Jackpotjoy, or the Gala Bingo one with The Chasers from the quiz show. “Plus the Tombola one, which makes it look like everyone is happy and having a nice time on a farm, drinking tea and shyeating cake. “The reality is people are sitting at home, alone, losing their money and sometimes their le to gambling.” For confidential support the Samaritans can be contacted for free around the clock  days a year on  .

Lewis is doing so well for someone so young.“The best thing you can say about Lewis is that it looks like he has been playing here for years.“It looks like he has about  games under his belt.“The fact he has only played about  games in his senior career is testament to him and how natural it is that he feels at home here.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/EE-DB-05012019-01-012-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"vlog dons in dubai day one","story":"With Aberdeen#s training camp in Dubai under way, Sean Wallace and Jamie Durent reflect on ing faces, an exit and the excellent facilities in the Middle East.Press and Journal sports writer Jamie and Evening Express chief football writer Sean will be sending video updates daily from the United Arab Emirates."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/DSC_1522-940x529.jpg ","title":"vlog dons in dubai the joy of football in the sun","story":"In the latest video blog from Dubai, Sean Wallace and Jamie Durent discuss Aberdeen#s training session that was open to supporters.They discuss which players impressed in the session and how much meeting the players clearly meant to the fans.Sean and Jamie also talk about going to an Asian Cup group game in Dubai where Australia beat Palestine -."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen volunteers give 20000 hours to help boost childrens activity","story":"Generous Aberdeen residents have given , hours of their time to volunteer in schools, in the hope of boosting pupils’ physical activity.Sport Aberdeen, the charity behind the city’s sports centres and classes, has revealed the amount of time devoted by volunteers is worth more than £,.Despite the number of volunteers staying the same across the country, Aberdeen has seen a sharp rise in the number of people giving up their time.It has grown by % to  so far in the current academic year.The level of participation from students has also increased sharply, according to the new figures, with a rise in participation sessions of % since the - academic year, to ,, and a rise of % compared to the last academic year.Female participation has also grown by % when compared to .Sport Aberdeen delivers the Active Schools programme across the city, in partnership with national sports body sportscotland, which places co-ordinators and managers in each school in the hope of increasing the physical activity of each child.The programme has existed in schools across Scotland for the past  years.Colin Taylor, chairman of Sport Aberdeen, said: “It is extremely encouraging and reassures me to know that young people across the city are being exposed to the best possible opportunities to participate in sport and physical activity from a young age.“Sport Aberdeen is committed to creating opportunities, inspiring people and changing lives and real progress has been made in the more deprived areas of the city to close the poverty related attainment gap.“This is the perfect example of the positive outcomes that can be achieved through partnership working.“These results have been achieved through a true team effort from our partnership with the schools and I’d like to thank the volunteers involved, especially the PE teachers and teachers, for their continued commitment and support, because without them the programme couldn’t happen.“Additionally, I’d like to thank our team of Active School co-ordinators and the support received from sportscotland, Aberdeen City Council, schools, colleagues within Sport Aberdeen, parents and of course the children and young people themselves who have all been vital in achieving these results.”Bosses behind the Active Schools programme say partnerships, such as those with Robert Gordon University, North East Scotland College, the Wood Foundation and other national governing bodies, have helped to achieve the surge in uptake and volunteering that has been seen across the country.Stewart Harris, chief executive of sportscotland, said: “It’s really encouraging to see the continued growth in participation in Active Schools activities across the country.“The success of Active Schools is the result of strong local partnerships between Active Schools teams, school staff, sports development teams in local authorities, regional managers from the governing bodies, and local sports clubs. By working together with Sport Aberdeen, we can continue to deliver more and better opportunities for young people of all abilities to take part in sport across the city as these latest figures show.“It is also rewarding to see the impact of programmes like Active Schools on the lives of the young people who take part, increasing their confidence and motivating them to continue an active lestyle in the future.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/EE-DB-05012019-01-009-833x564.jpg ","title":"cairns project builds pictures from the past at historic park","story":"Cairns bearing historic information about a community have been installed at an Aberdeen park.There are five dferent interpretation boards in Stewart Park, in Hilton, which have been put in place over the past year. vw, px\"  The project was spearheaded by the Aberdeen Women’s Alliance, working in partnership with a number of other groups, including the Aberdeen City Council’s unpaid work team, and the Aberdeen Libraries and communications teams.Councillor Lesley Dunbar, who represents the area and is part of the Aberdeen Women’s Alliance, worked with members Fiona Rennie and Vida Young to come up with the idea.There are five dferent cairns, which are made of recycled granite, dotted around the park, with each bearing information about the green space and surrounding area.One board features information about the Hilton Quarries, which were situated south of Hilton Road, while the northern quarries were where Stewart Park stands.It also bears information about Isabella Knowles, who had a bad accident which changed her personality completely, leading her to pass herself off as a man and leave her job at the Stoneywood Paper Mills, after which she became a thief, fraudster and jail-breaker and escaped from the Aberdeen East Jail twice.Another features the whale jaw bones which were donated to the park in  by the captain of whaling ship, the Benbow.One cairn tells the story of Margaret Penny, who was the we of an Aberdeen whaling captain called William Penny.She went with her husband and son on an expedition to Baffin Island, and it is thought she would have been the first European woman to winter in the Arctic Islands, north of Canada.Other park highlights such as Hilton House receives its own cairn, where the Aberdeen Women’s Alliance spent some time trying to track down inhabitants of the house.They found Inez Mary Mackay Ferguson, who lived there with her family until her father – a local solicitor – disappeared, and the family moved to live with other relatives.She went to live with her mother’s family in Berkhampstead and became a suffragist, working with Millicent Fawcett, the leader and founder of the National Union of Suffrage Societies.A further cairn dedicates its information to the opening of the park – on June ,  – and to Mrs Jean Taylor, who was instrumental in setting up a play area for the children of Woodside.When she passed away in , she bequeathed a total of £ to be used to create the green space, with Aberdeen Town Council allocating £, to purchase  acres of land from the Hilton House estate.The final cairn, which was installed at the end of December, bears details of tramways in the city, the Taylor Memorial Well, which was built in honour of Mrs Taylor, and the park in the Second World War.During the Aberdeen Blitz of April  , three -kilo high-explosive bombs were detonated in Stewart Park.One killed a young man who was walking through the park with his girlfriend, who was left seriously injured.Ms Dunbar said: “It’s a great example of partnership working.“It’s taken a while but it’s been a real delight to work on.“We found out a lot about women who lived in the area.“There’ll be a lot of stories people won’t have heard.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"iceland plans new ayr store","story":"NewsIceland plans new Ayr store as Food Warehouse makes application to open at Heathfield Retail ParkAn application has been made to occupy the former Homebase unit at Heathfield, which was vacated last year.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  JAN NewsThe vacant site at Heathfield \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIceland’s new Food Warehouse store is lining up to open in Ayr. The food giant plans to move into the old Homebase shop at the Heathfield Retail Park. Home Bargains could also occupy the large empty unit, according to documents lodged with South Ayrshire Council. Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. A planning statement said: “The proposal is not speculative. Unit b will be occupied by Food Warehouse.” The plot is too big for only one shop, according to Heathfield Retail Park operators Ediston. The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"29-year-old-locked-up-after-breaching-borders-ban-on-hogmanay","story":"A MAN who is banned from entering the Scottish Borders was found by police during a disturbance in Hawick on Hogmanay.Twenty nine year old Shaun Grieve appeared from custody at Selkirk Sherf Court and pleaded guilty to breaching the court order by being in Kenilworth Avenue on Monday.But Grieve, who now lives at Shakespeare Way, Blackburn, Lancashire, denied repeatedly contacting Nicola McWatters at her home in Galalaw Road, Hawick, on December  in an alleged breach of another court order.Defence lawyer Ross Dow said his client had been back in Hawick over the New year period as his grandfather had suffered a stroke.But Sherf Derrick McIntyre noted Grieves previous convictions and that number of breaches of bail and refused a motion for bail.Grieve was remanded in custody until the trial date of February .Sentence was deferred for the offence of entering the Borders on Hogmanay until the outcome of the trial."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-swimming-pool-latest-to-close-due-to-technical-issues","story":"SWIMMERS in Galashiels have faced a high and dry start to the new year.The towns pool was closed due to mechanical problems on Monday, December .And despite repairs being carried out during the planned holiday closure staff were unable to open the doors again on Thursday or Friday.A spokeswoman for operators Live Borders said: \"Following improvement yesterday , we are hopeful of getting the temperature up to suitable level and reopening over the weekend.\"We apologise for any inconvenience this closure may have caused.\"This latest closure comes just days after Selkirk Swimming Pool was closed for a week in the run up to Christmas for similar technical problems.We reported last month how during   attendances at swimming pools, gyms and other sports facilities across the region had fallen year-on-year in   by more than ,."},{"url":null,"title":"good-behaviour-order-for-bowden-man-after-new-year-bust-up","story":"A BOWDEN man involved in a New Years Day bust-up with his partner has been ordered to be of good behaviour for the next three months.Graeme Reid pleaded guilty to shouting and swearing during the incident.The -year-old also admitted threatening his partner with violence and repeatedly striking the door of a house in Dick Road.The case will recall at Selkirk Sherf Court on April ."},{"url":null,"title":"organisers-hope-to-rekindle-peebles-torchlight-procession","story":"ORGANISERS of Peebles Hogmanay Torchlight Procession are hopeful the spectacle willthis year ndash after cancelling the  event to give volunteers a break.Event director Neil Dalgleish told us: ldquoWe have had a full on year and we wanted to give volunteers a deserved break at the new year with their families.ldquoA huge amount of work goes into organising the event and we will have to start preparing now for .The procession has taken place in the town since .

financial trouble.Despite efforts from several long-standing committee members to save the School Brae club, they were forced to concede defeat.Since an insolvency meeting was held last September, discussions have been taking place behind closed doors between community groups, the Scottish government, councillors and club members regarding a takeover of the premises.And the clubrsquos administrator has agreed to support Peebles Community Trust in its efforts to buy the building.Under an agreed arrangement Peebles Community Trust will occupy and manage the club until the purchase is complete.And once the buy-out has been finalised, expected to be later this year, it will act as headquarters for the Trust, Peebles Ex-Servicemens Pipe Band and Peebles Mens Shed.The first stage of a grant application from Scottish Land Fund to purchase the property was completed this week.Peebles Community Trust chairman Lawrie Hayworth praised the co-operation and support shown by French Duncan, the administrator, club members, the Scottish government, local councillors and partner organisations.He told us: \"This has been the home of the Peebles pipe band since the club opened more than

members of the more recently-founded Mens Shed group.Mr Hayworth also hopes the re-opened club will be popular with other local organisations.He added: \"We plan to create a space for a wide range of organisations to undertake their activities with the ability to store their equipment on site.\"This has been a particular dficulty for many groups for whom having access to on site storage has been extremely dficult.\"We envisage this as a community hub offering the widest possible use by groups who require both activity and storage space, whilst retaining the ability to host popular fundraising coffee mornings and other events.The purchase of the Ex-Servicemens Club is just one of the developments to be discussed during a Peebles Community Trust open day next weekend.Directors of the Trust

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

Would he still be playinghe had not put his body through quite so much punishment Ivan Lendl, under whom Murray won all his biggest inidual titles, was the only coach able to consistently ramp up his chargersquos aggression, while tempering the Scotrsquos tendency to allow negativity to overwhelm him.It was no surprise Murray struggled to keep believing when always standing in his way were three of the all-time greats. Four times he lost in slam finals, twice to Djokovic and twice to Federer, before finally breaking his duck in appropriately gruelling fashion against Djokovic at the US Open in .The following summer came his career-defining moment when he ended Britainrsquos -year wait for a male singles champion at Wimbledon, adding a second title three years later then writing his own piece of history by becoming the first tennis player to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals in singles.In the autumn of , with his rivals at last showing some weakness, Murray surged thrillingly to the top of the rankings, clinching the number one spot by winning the ATP Finals in London.What seemed like it might be the start of the Murray era turned out instead to be a glorious swansong. Barely six months later, the first signs of his hip problem emerged and, despite surgery and an extensive rehabilitation and reconditioning programme, there has been no way back to the top.Perhaps even more important than his achievements on the court, the understated Murray emerged as one of the sportrsquos great trend-setters.First there was Murrayrsquos realisation in his early twenties that, rather than just employing a coach, having a team of people around him would help him reach his peak physically and mentally.Then, with a grand slam title still tantalisingly elusive, he reached out to a former great in Lendl, establishing the trend of the super coach. When their partnership came to an end, Murray broke more ground by hiring Amelie Mauresmo, who became the most high-profile female coach in tennis.Most top sportsmen would rather not stick their head above the parapet but, once he became comfortable in the limelight, Murray swam against the tide, speaking out forcefully on issues like equality and doping.He also embraced his role as the figurehead of British tennis, actively supporting and encouraging those emerging in his wake.

A Healthier Future, which closes on January .The plans could see Scotland become the first country in the world to pass legislation banning multi-buy promotions on unhealthy foods as part of efforts to tackle obesity. Proposals also include capping portion sizes in restaurants and takeaways, mandatory calorie information on menus and extending the sugar tax to milky drinks like milkshakes and hot chocolates which contain less than % milk.In its response to the consultation, BMA Scotland said restrictions on price promotions \"should be comprehensive and not allow exceptions\", for example cracking down on buy-one-get-one-free deals but failing to target items such as multipacks of crisps and confectionary which are \"designed to promote greater consumption\".It added: \"Consideration should also be given to banning the use of packaging to promote a productrsquos lsquohealthierrsquo nutritional content when one unhealthy nutrient has simply been replaced by another. For example it is not uncommon for products to prominently claim to be reduced or low fat when in reality this has been achieved by signicantly increasing a productrsquos sugar content. This risks misleading consumers who are trying to take a healthier approach to their purchases.\"It comes after retail and food industry representatives criticised the proposals as \"badly thought through and unenforceable.The Food and Drink Federation Scotland said there was \"no evidence of the effectiveness of these measures in tackling obesity\", and stressed that the \"promotion to adults of all foods is a fundamental commercial freedom\".It added that one of its members - an unnamed ldquoiconic Scottish brand - could lose pound million in sales as a direct result of such measures, which it said would ldquolikely result in major redundancies.Ewan MacDonald-Russell, head of policy at the Scottish Retail Consortium said there was a \"dearth of detail over the exact definition of products, categories, and store areas\" and argued that there was no evidence to show that price promotions \"encourage over-consumption\".Dr Lewis Morrison, chair of BMA Scotland, said obesity was placing a \"massive burden\" on the NHS and \"bold\" action was needed.Dr Morrison said: ldquoSales promotions are routinely deployed by retailers to encourage consumers to purchase products and are disproportionately used to promote unhealthy food and drink. Their eye-catching nature also contributes to in-store environments that favour unhealthy dietary behaviour by drawing additional attention to such products.ldquoOn this basis it is clear that mandatory and comprehensive action is needed to help improve diets and reduce consumption of unhealthy products.

Love is a key word for Shudo. When you consider whether to keep each object, or let it go, you ask yourself whether you ldquoone hundred percent love it or not.So, to get into the groove, we begin with a question about love. I hadnrsquot expected this to be one of the first I would be asked, and I have to admit that lurking in the back of my mind is a previous interview I did with a decluttering expert. That woman had told me that some years ago she began to declutter her house using the method created by guru Marie Kondo ndash an approach in which one decides whether to keep an object by holding it up and asking whether it gives you a spark of joy. She went through the objects in her household, sorting and disposing, until finally she came to her husband and decided that he did not give her that spark of joy. She then packed the car with her children and a few possessions and drove off.The story had left me with a mild terror around decluttering. Whatone of us were to throw the other out into the world of recycling, along with the bin bags of unread books, uncomfortable clothes and useless gadgets  We have, after all, our ups and downs, like most couples. Whatwe were to declutter on a not ldquoone hundred percent day Fortunately thatrsquos not what happens. We look at each other, a little awkwardly, astaken by surprise, but it seems as good a moment as any, here, at the bottom of our stairs, to do what is effectively a renewal of our vows. ldquoI will, comes easily.Decluttering has been a zeitgeist activity for many years now, but, with the arrival this month on Netflix of Tidying Up, a series that follows Marie Kondo, creator of the Konmari method and author of Spark Joy, as she helps ious households, therersquos an extra buzz around it. Edinburgh-based Shudorsquos approach shares a great deal with Kondorsquos ndash itrsquos all about considering items, and asking how they make you feel, before allocating them to piles to keep, throw, or maybe keep. Therersquos a bit of ritual and thanking of objects. Therersquos also a lot of origami-style folding of clothing involved. So much folding, in fact, that my friend, after Irsquod started the process, texted me to ask, ldquoAre you folding the f*** out of everything yet But Shudorsquos method is also subtly dferent from Kondorsquos. She calls it ldquoFor the love of less and says it goes deeper. Where Kondo asks people to consider whether something sparks joy ndash comparing it to the feeling that one has holding a puppy ndash Shudo asks whether you feel love. Her philosophy is also not just about getting rid of stuff ndash itrsquos about shting towards a le of less.ldquoFu-ai-ho, meaning, ldquofear, love and abundance of nothingness, is the Japanese expression she uses to describe her philosophy. She distinguishes it from the Japanese declutter tradition that most people follow, which is called Danshari, meaning refuse, separate and dispose. ldquoMy approach is much more positive. We are focussing on love and being in love with your le and your world and decluttering process is to achieve that.But what, I ask, is the dference between the love she speaks of and Kondorsquos ldquojoy  ldquoJoy, she says, ldquois one aspect of love and love is deeper and broader. Marie Kondo is great at the process of decluttering, but what Irsquom focussing on is how we change afterwards. Itrsquos about change for our le, but also for the whole planet by more consideration for the environment. Materialism and consumerism are creating a violence for our world ndash not only for the humans but also for the animals.The first room we poke a nose into is the office I share with Andy. On the wall, above the piles of paper and between bookcases over-flowing with books, is a painting which incorporates the word chaos, and the mathematical formula for it. Is it okay, we ask, to leave it on the wall  ldquoYes. I think so, she says. ldquoI think it could be the good message that we observe the chaos, but you two are not in it.We move on quickly to the wardrobe upstairs, which is the first space we are going to work on. I do feel slightly embarrassed about my mess, but, I also think I shouldnrsquot feel that way. No one should feel shame over a bit of mess, and,Irsquom honest, for much of my le Irsquove enjoyed time spent in relatively cluttered spaces. I grew up in one, and always felt that a certain amount of stuff was what came with a busy creative le.Yet, people obviously do feel shame. I noticed that frequently, in Marie Kondorsquos Tidying Up, those decluttering their lives in front of the camera, can be heard saying that they feel embarrassed or even ldquomortied. As I go through this process, Irsquod like to avoid that. But, at the same time, I do feel it would be useful to move on from the mess. I have had the feeling in recent years that too much of my le was getting sucked into looking for things, too often there was so much stuff on my desk that I would choose to work at the kitchen table rather than there.Shudo gets me to pull everything out from my wardrobe ndash the whole tangle of jumpers, T-shirts and dresses which Irsquove stuffed onto shelves, unfolded ndash and put it on the floor. From there, I start iding. One pile to keep, one maybe and one to verbally ldquothank and throw out or pass on.What is wonderful is that in her company you feel no judgement. I have no idea what she thinks about the inidual objects I hold up, stare at, then choose a pile for. All I know is that she does a lovely encouraging clap every time you get rid of something signicant. ldquoWell done, Vicky. You are so brave.One thing becomes clear very quickly. My wardrobe contains many things that I have loved dearly but have literally worn to death ndash shoes with holes so large they are unfixable, a leather jacket that looks asit has been dragged along a gravel track, boots that smell of dead rat. Then there are other items, almost never worn, some still with price tags, many of them bought for me by my mum and kept because I somehow couldnrsquot bear to send them on, asto charity-shop them would be some betrayal.I tell Shudo that one of my dficulties with stuff comes from the fact that my mum is such a giver ndash itrsquos one of the things I love about her, and actually she has given me some of my favourite clothes, but it can bring extra clutter into our lives.Then there are the clothing items from loved ones who have passed away ndash my grandmother, my brother, a dear friend. I hold in my hands a T-shirt, worn by my brother on a fun run, months before he was taken abruptly from the world by a pulmonary embolism three years ago. It seems to me I still feel his physicality there in that fabric. I put it on the ldquomaybe pile because I canrsquot really bring myself either to thank it or say that I love it. Both of those options seem too painful. I know the T-shirt is not my brother, the person I love, yet I cant bring myself to let it go. Shudo, assensing something, suggests we fold it up nicely and put it on the shelf.She teaches me to fold. Folding is, it seems, the second part of the process, and at the heart of a storage system where you can see everything, where you need not waste moments in the search for an item. ldquoYou will enjoy folding every night after you have worn the clothes. And we will fold everything. Even underwear.We fold my brotherrsquos T-shirt in on itself into a neat rectangle. There is something about seeing the T-shirt there, perfectly folded, at the end of the line of my own tops, not forgotten in a chaotic nest of fabric, that seems more comforting. Folding also feels prayerful.Therersquos no doubt that a declutter is an emotional journey. It seems to me that at the heart of it is grief ndash not only the grief felt for those loved ones lost along the way, but for our past selves, our childrenrsquos babyhood, our own lives before children. Another item comes down onto the floor, a whole case from the cupboard above. It contains, in fact, only one piece of clothing, one, which I tell Shudo, I had been thinking about before she came.Itrsquos a ridiculous pink ballgown that I wore for the fancy dress party at which I got together with Andy. I was , celebrating my Halloween birthday with a kind of Dickensian party which I called Mis Havishamrsquos Tea Party Of The Undead, and wore a grey wig and horror make-up. We ran around outside in Holyrood park. The bottom of the dress got stained with a layer of mud. It was trashed, and, two babies later, my body can no longer fit into it. Yet, still, I have kept it.Shudo offers a suggestion, perhaps I could put the dress on and have a photograph taken in it, maybe with Andy. ldquoYoursquore joking. It wouldnrsquot meet, I said. Instead, we agree that I will hold it up in front of me and we will have a shot taken of the two of us together. It feels like a second renewal of vows ndash I keep him, he keeps me, but we throw this, the dress, away ndash and before I know it, it is squeezed into a bin bag. One of Shudorsquos tips is that once bagged up you must get your thanked and discarded items out of the house as quickly as possible, and certainly within  hours, so it is gone by the end of the night ndash all thatrsquos left a picture on my phone. Three bin bags accompany it out the door, those ones to the charity shop.ldquoTheir house is very simple, for example bit of grass matt on the floor and one big table and maybe seasonal flowers in a vase, and maybe calligraphy, thatrsquos it.As a teenager she didnrsquot appreciate so much what her mother taught her, but when she left Japan at the age of  to go to America, where she studied performing arts, she started to reconnect with it.She is now a master of the tea ceremony, a title it took her  years of training to earn. Zen is at the heart of her philosophy. One of the things she talks frequently about is ldquoan abundance of nothing. I have to admit that the first time she used that phrase I felt a pang of terror. But she is keen to make clear that this is a good place. ldquoIt is nothingness, but yoursquore automatically connected to everything. Releasing our attachment to something automatically makes us reunite with the whole universe..That all sounds very alluring. A lot of ldquofu-ai-ho does. Irsquom also thrilled to have some origami-like folding skills to teach my children and a surprisingly enjoyable activity to do with my husband, one which feels like it will bring us together. In the whole process, there is, for me only one moment of regret, and it is a brief one. Later, when Shudo was gone, I couldnrsquot stop thinking about the pink ball gown. This was mainly because, instead of putting it with the charity items for recycling, I had put it in the bin, thinking it was too trashed to be of use to anyone. So, I went down in the dark to the skip and peered into its reeking shadows, hoping to rescue it. The bin was already heaped high and my dress at the bottom, beneath piles of wooden planks and oozing binliners, too hard to reach. Only then, in fact, did I really decide that it truly was time to let it go. That dress had served me well. I could release it to the universe with thanks.Mio Shudo can be contacted at mio@fortheloveofless"},{"url":null,"title":"swinney-plan-would-give-teachers-enhanced-pay-rise-of-12","story":"The largest teaching union yesterday gave its approval to open a statutory ballot over the pay dispute, with notice of the action being issued to local authority employers.However, Swinney yesterday backed a revision to the rejected offer which he hopes will be accepted this month and end the standoff.His move is the latest development in the long-running saga over the failure to reach a deal on teachersrsquo pay this year. Salaries are determined by a tripartite body including the Government, council representatives and unions.The current offer, tabled the local authorities, would give teachers earning up to pound, a % rise in three consecutive years.A second strand includes an overhaul of the pay scale which,accepted, could add another % to the salaries of some teachers this year.However, the Educational Institute of Scotland , which represents teachers, rejected the offer and is moving towards a strike ballot.Swinney has now suggested a change to the pay scale element that would result in a % uplt from this month.

It is an enhanced offer and I will ask COSLA to agree this and to formally offer it to unions after  January.

I think how you frame it mentally is a big key to success.Martine explained that thinking about his own resolutions in a dferent way helped him to achieve a goal he set almost two decades ago.He said: ldquoI gave up drinking, more or less entirely. I didnrsquot have a problem or anything, other than being Scottish, I just thought I wanted to stop so I gave up in  and I found it was easy.ldquoThe way I managed it was to think about what I wanted to do, rather than what I donrsquot want to do.ldquoI knew I wanted to wake up in the morning feeling fresh and alert, and I knew that on a Sunday morning with a hangover that would be the opposite. The way I framed it was in terms of waking up feeling good, and I knew that not having alcohol in my system would help that process.Despite many peoplersquos resolutions staying the same over the past few decades, the way people think about them has moved towards a more negative mindset, according to Martin. It mirrors scientic findings which have shown people have a negative brain bias, and negative thoughts are more easily settled on than positive ones.According to American researcher Dr John Cacioppo, Ph.D, the brain reacts more strongly to negative stimuli, which is thought to be an evolutionary technique to help keep people out of harms way and protect them. Dr Cacioppo suggested the only way to counteract the negative bias is to have frequent, small positive experiences that will help sht the imbalance.Martin said small changes may not only help achieve a more positive outlook on le but could be another way to smash new yearrsquos resolution goals and change them in to lelong habits.The slow and steady approach is particular helpful, he said, when it comes to health-related goals as it gives the body time to adjust.According not a iety of reports. Around % of peoplersquos bew yearsrsquo resolutions are health-related, whileSchemes like Dry January, where people are encouraged to give up all alcohol for a month, or Veganuary, where people eat vegan meals in January, donrsquot help people to change their lestyle or habits in the long term, said Martin.He said: ldquoIf you try and make new yearrsquos resolutions practical and achievable, in small steps it should help you to stick to them, but I know that tends to go against the grain.ldquoWe are seeing more and more things like Veganuary and Dry January that encourage you to do something that you may not be used to, straight away.ldquoItrsquos betteryou just say lsquoIrsquom going to do this for the next few weeks.rsquo And start small.

A Law Society solicitor, the fiscal, will present the case against her and Mickel.If the case of professional misconduct is proved, Ahmed-Sheikh and Mickel could be fined and even struck off as solicitors.Ahmed-Sheikh resigned as a director of Hamilton Burns when she was elected an MP in May . She has not practised law since then or since the company went bust in , owing, among other debts, pound, in tax.She was defeated in her seat in Ochil and South Perthshire in the  General Election and is now a partner with former SNP leader Salmond in Slainte Media, the company which produces Salmondrsquos weekly TV show for the Russian broadcaster RT. In one of the latest submissions to Companies House, Ahmed-Sheikh has changed her nationality from British to Scottish.In May , the Law Society launched an investigation into the handling of the trust fund by Hamilton Burns.Under the complaints procedure an investigation is first held andit is believed there is a case to answer it is then referred to the shyScottish Solicitorsrsquo Discipline Tribunal, which deals with serious disciplinary matters. The fact that the investigation has led to tomorrowrsquos hearing means that the Law Society believes there is a prima facie case against her and Mickel.The Law Society refused to comment ahead of the tribunal hearingAhmed-Sheikh did not respond to requests for comment. It is believed she will be represented in the procedure by the Edinburgh law firm Kennedys Law and is vigorously contesting the allegations against her.After the demise of Hamilton Burns, Mickel was understood to have been living and working as a ski instructor in Switzerland. He could not be contacted.However, when the initial inquiry was launched by the Law Society he described allegations of financial impropriety as ldquospurious and ldquodefamatory.He said then: ldquoI set up the fund up and put my own money into it and the trust runs in my name as the Niall Mickel Trust. It was previously administered by Tasmina and I when she was a partner in Hamilton Burns."},{"url":null,"title":"the-pickup-one-womans-experience-of-the-game","story":"Over the noise, I was sure this man had just asked me why I was not at home with my children.I feel the need to emphasise that I was not flirting. I had no interest whatsoever in your man but this man was not the type to make chitchat with a woman.He drew my attention to the low quality of female in the nightclub and expressed sadness and frustration that so many young women were overweight. I suggested that the shape of unknown women might not be any of his business and that it is considered impolite to comment.He told me that I was \"heavy\". \"You need to look after yourself better,\" he said. \"Theres no excuse for young women not to look after themselves and for young women to be overweight.\"A light dawned. In certain circles, this is a tactic called \"negging\" and this hard nonsense is not unusual. The idea is that the man insults his intended in order to tap in to her presumed self-esteem issues and make her work for his attention. Its a classic tactic of the so-called \"pickup artist\" movement, a misogynist subculture with a set of rules for picking up women or, as they style it, \"game\". There are gradients of how odious this is but the lighter elements ndash such as negging ndash are fairly mainstream.I wouldnt be drawn. I laughed, told him I was perfectly happy as I am.He was a relatively short man and not unattractive, obviously took care of his appearance and had a confidence bordering on bullish.\"Why are you here \" he asked me. \"Wouldnt you be happier at home in your kitchen with your children \" He wasnt trying to be a cheeky chappy. He wasnt trying to be a contrarian. He was, quite seriously, asking me the question.Two things kept me on the spot: an ingrained politeness and a desire to confound his beliefs by confronting him with a women who has neither children nor a kitchen anyone would want to pass much time in.\"I dont have children and I also dont want children,\" I told him. He seemed genuinely curious. \"Why not  \"\"Well,\" I said. \"Why would you assume I would \"He had the obvious answer: \"Women are only ever truly happy when they are at home with their children.\" Ah, there. The penny dropped. This guy was a pickup artist of the mens rights activism type.Mens rights activists espouse misogyny as ideology. They believe feminism has oppressed and disadvantaged men, they see no fundamental unfairness of societyrsquos treatment of women.They have hijacked feminist terminology and narrative for their own purposes and use the perceived evils of feminism to explain marital breakdown, romantic inadequacy and workplace failure.Id read so much about these fellows yet one never really believes one will cross paths in real le with the truly odious corners of the internet.Women should be at home in the kitchen with their children, not abroad at night in clubs. Yet who would he huntwe were safely at home  His stance was classic mens rights activism. It is a set of kaleidoscopically contradictory beliefs: that women should be sexually available to any man at any time that women should be despised as sluts that women should keep themselves exclusively for their husbands.Sorry chaps, as women have been told repeatedly, you canrsquot have it all.I wanted to stick around and see what  he had to say. He had much  to say.He point blank refused to entertain the notion that I might be happy being single. This was impossible. Women, he told me, are delusional about being single.\"The only reason you think youre happy being single,\" he said, and Ive had to edit this to take out certain suggestions for how he believed a man might benefit me, \"Is because youve never met a man who knows you, who is your intellectual equal, your emotional equal, who dominates you and who you can submit to.\"Women, he believes, look after themselves better - by which I imagine he means make themselves aesthetically pleasing for men - when they are in a relationship. Single women let themselves go.\"Thats why we have so many young women who are overweight. The rise of the single woman is causing obesity. Women are in their best shape when they are with the right man.\"Briefly, I mulled this over. I have put weight on while being single, thats right. But not due to unhappiness, due to contentment. No longer wanting to conform to a standard ideal of what my younger self believed men wanted was a great release. Besides the bald fact of this man being a dick, he was also a dick who had everything backward.He told me how hed been furious to receive a flyer through his door from a famous weight loss club and had gone as far as to phone up to complain about how the diet method the club uses messes with a womans hormones, forcing her into a weight loss weight gain cycle. Imagine that anger, that need for control.He carried on to tell me how damaged society has become by women who think they can raise children on their own as single mothers. \"People think the blurring of the gender roles is acceptable, its wrong. Men and womens roles should be separate but they need to work together - men providing and women at home.\"And so, you might think, this sounds not unlike being trapped next to an elderly and cantankerous uncle at an event organised by the side of the family youd usually ignore.But this is a relatively young man and these are his firmly held beliefs. The controlled hatred rolling from him was palpable.Receiving this information in a blunt and unemotional way was not easy. This has always been my tactic in a chat up situation. Present as disinterested. Do the rejecting before they reject you, save face at all costs. But this time it wasnt a tactic, I was quite determined to emphasise that I had no interest in him and this was not a chat up situation.Of course, I neednt have worried. How silly to have ever thought so. I was far too old for him. Despite him telling me he was mid s, there was no way this man would look at any woman upwards of .He told me about womens \"biological shelf le\" and how I was inching past it. \"A man,\" he said, \"Can father limitless children but a woman only ovulates  times a year and so she has a biological shelf le - thats a fact. It cant be disputed.\"I wonder how many women are aware of how many times a year they ovulate. This chap had clearly done his reading. I was reaching my limit now. I thought knowing his tricks and his trade I would be relatively immune but this bile was starting to have an impact as I thought of the other, younger women he might have tried it on and my other, younger self who might just have been susceptible.I know myself now, I know what I want and what I believe. But my late teens and my s were a quagmire of uncertainty, my self-esteem an unreliable flibbertigibbet. I would have tried to impress this man. I would have seen his views as a challenge, tried to win him round.And thats what pickup artists rely on, the vulnerability women in a non-feminist society develop by being constantly told they dont and cant fit an ideal of beauty, career success and motherhood.I was trying to tune back into the music, he was hearing the clattering din of misandry.He switched his phaser to our education system, a \"failed disgrace\". \"It is sucking the creativity out of our children,\" he said, as a gaggle of joyous young women squeezed past on their way to the bar, \"And teaching them conformity.\"Its teaching them homosexuality is ok, feminism is ok. The only reason we have feminists and lesbians is that the alpha man is dying out.\"There is no such thing as a lesbian - only a woman who hasnt found an alpha male to submit to.\"That was my limit. There was only so much talk of submission before I admitted defeat and just... walked away. I didnt chide him, I didnt shout at him. I just walked wearily away wondering how many very young women hes manipulated, how much emotional damage hes caused. His anger had left a weight on me no amount of dancing could lt and I carried that weight all the way home.How many others like him are there with this deep rage towards women  This rage, it breeds in the corners of the internet but it is carried into real le by these men with beliefs more common than you might think.I hope any women he encounters does the same: walks away and leaves him in the dark all alone."},{"url":null,"title":"new-project-to-tackle-child-poverty-in-scotland-as-230000-struggle-to-feed-families","story":"New project to tackle child poverty in Scotland as , struggle to feed familiesGillian McCormick founder of the Glasgow North West Food Bank at the Food Bank oltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtn Millbrix Avenue inltspan classtruncate-full-screengt Glasgow#s Whiteinch area.Kirsty Anderson Newsquest   Herald and TimesNew project to tackle child poverty in Scotland as , struggle to feed familiesAudrey Flanagan, manager at the Glasgow south east Foodbank, pictured at the fooltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtdbank on Butterbiggiltspan classtruncate-full-screengtns rd, Govanhill, Glasgow.

Homework doesnrsquot materialise, sick days just happen to coincide with school trips but itrsquos really because therersquos no money at home to cover to the costs.Already straggling behind, as each school week passes their hopes of catching up with better off classmates slip a little further through their tiny fingers.It is, agrees Andrea Bradley of teachersrsquo union EIS, a desperate picture of education in Scotland today, where one in four children comes from a family gripped by poverty and where arriving in the classroom with rumbling tummies is just one disturbing element of potentially catastrophic shadow blighting thousands of young lives.ldquoItrsquos shocking and alarming for teachers, says Bradley, the unionrsquos assistant secretary. ldquoTeachers tell us they know some children are not eating between leaving school at pm and arriving next day at am.The complex issues facing , Scots children in poverty ndash not all of them living in obviously deprived areas and a signicant number from working families - and a raft of strategies aimed at helping educators to ease their plight, are now to form part of a major project to be delivered to the nationrsquos schools.Currently being devised by the EIS, the countryrsquos largest teaching union, in partnership with the Scottish Government, a pound, two-year project intends to equip educators ndash many from comfortable backgrounds with no personal experience of living in poverty ndash with the skills to spot pupils experiencing hardship in the hope of boosting their prospects and closing the attainment gap.The project, to be launched in schools by summer , will include strategies aimed at supporting pupils which could range from changes in homework tasks to take into account children who may have no internet or even colouring pencils at home, to being aware of costs related to school trips, unorms and events like dress down days which call on children to \"bring a pound\" for charity.A key element of the project will draw on research which highlights the complicated impacts of poverty on families such as mental health issues, and the knock-on implications for childrenrsquos educational achievement which may already have damaged their learning prospects well before they even start school.It is expected to also equip teachers with a broader understanding of how to identy children in the grip of poverty, from looking at their pallor and whether they are particularly lethargic in the classroom, their behaviour, how well their clothes fit and even the snacks they bring ndash or, more often, donrsquot bring ndash to school.It follows recent guidance from the EIS to its members, which suggested avoiding punitive action over issues such as incomplete homework and lack of gym kit which could be explained by dficulties at home.ldquoThere needs to be a real sensitivity in how these issues are handled, stresses Bradley. ldquoWe want the project to have a really strong focus on the all the causes and consequences of poverty, and we want teachers to have that wider societal view of childrens experiences beyond the classroom.ldquoChildren dont come to school as pupils and in isolation of what happens in family le at home and in the community.It comes amid rising concern that Scotlandrsquos children are being hardest hit by benefits restrictions and rising living costs which are leaving even working families struggling to cope.While the Scottish Government has ambitious plans to signicantly reduce poverty and inequality by , independent monitoring suggests the number of children living in poverty in the UK is set to increase to one in three by -, taking numbers back to those last seen in the s.Concerns are already rising over the impact on childrenrsquos physical wellbeing. There were calls last week for a UK Minister for Hunger to tackle malnutrition while recent figures from food bank charity the Trussell Trust showed a % rise in people relying on food parcels between April and September last year, among them over , children.Meanwhile, a Scottish Government report last month showed the gap in educational performance between rich and poor primary school pupils is widening: just  per cent of P children from the most deprived areas met the standard expected in literacy compared with  per cent in the least deprived.All of which comes against a background of an ever-widening skills gap across a range of sectors and demands from employers.According to Professor Jane Callaghan, director of child wellbeing and protection at Stirling University, poverty seeps into and damages many areas of childrenrsquos learning and development.ldquoFood poverty has implicationschildren are under-nourished or poorly nourished there are knock-on effects for brain development, she says. ldquoBut food alone is not going to fix it.She paints a disturbing picture of poverty depriving children of toys and play facilities to develop both emotional and motor skills, and the impact of time-poor parents gripped by depression that saps their ability to support their children even when they want to.ldquoFamilies donrsquot have a lot of money to provide activities during holidays, or good quality play equipment. That has a negative impact because play is one of the most important things for childhood development, she adds.The stress of poverty is also an issue. ldquoIn-work poverty produces precarious circumstances for parents. That has an impact on parenting practices: the more stressed you are, the harder it is to be emotionally responsive to children.Poverty can lead to a lack of aspiration, she continues. ldquoA lot of families in poverty really value education. Butwe donrsquot pay enough attention to poverty and social equality issues, we are just putting a Band-Aid over the problems.EIS equality committee vice-convener Caroline Yates, who has taught children in deprived areas, paints a bleak picture of classroom le for thousands of Scottish pupils.ldquoIf children are hungry, theyrsquore not ready to learn, she says. ldquoTheyrsquoll be very lethargic and canrsquot concentrate. They might say they didnrsquot have time for breakfast and try to cover up whatrsquos going on.ldquoThey wonrsquot have gym equipment or it wonrsquot be the right size because theyrsquove grown. They come to school without a pencil.ldquoChildren from deprived backgrounds come into school already up to  months behind their peers in maths and language skills.She adds: ldquoTeachers donrsquot grudge doing things to help children, but therersquos increasing frustration with a system that allows this to happen to children.Audrey Flanagan, of Glasgow South East Foodbank, sees an increasing number of families calling for support ndash she reckons up % between April and July last year.ldquoTherersquos a poverty of hope among these people, she says. ldquoFamilies are so ground down, they canrsquot lt their heads.ldquoTeachers are not unaware of children who are living in poverty, and itrsquos clear that they want kids to have a good education. But that only way to do that istheir parents have more money.Poverty campaigners have called on the Scottish Government to act to help ease the pressure.ldquoThe Scottish Government could use its budget to bring forward delivery of its new income supplement, says Neil Cowan of the Poverty Alliance. ldquoThis is to be introduced in  but families simply cannot wait until then.ldquoWe know that poverty has a huge impact on educational attainment, and so anything that schools or local authorities can do to reduce the cost of the school day and lsquopoverty-proofrsquo their practice should have a positive impact, he said.And John Dickie of the Child Poverty Action Group agrees. ldquoTrips, after-school activities, not being able to afford the cost of materials even for core curriculum activities, the cost of home economics and technical materials, all creates real pressure and stress on children and families, he says.ldquoWe know that when families have extra money therersquos increased spending on fruit, vegetables, and books. When we see reduction in income, therersquos a damaging impact on children.The new pound, EIS-led project follows a pound million Scottish Government pledge in its first Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan launched in March last year includes a range of measures intended to support low income families.Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: ldquoWersquove learned from our work on the Scottish Attainment Challenge that the quality of teaching and learning is the most important factor in raising attainment and reducing the poverty related attainment gap.ldquoThis funding will create two posts to develop training for teachers and head teachers to better understand how we can remove the barriers that poverty can put on a young personrsquos ability to learn, and bring us closer to achieving our goal of closing the attainment gap.MUM of four Gillian McCormick says there are times when the challenges her family face hit her so hard that she canrsquot help but break down and sob.ldquoI actually spent the whole of yesterday in tears, it was absolutely horric, she admits.ldquoMy daughter is going through tests for autism. My son, Mikey, has Downs Syndrome, hersquos in a wheelchair and he canrsquot talk. Itrsquos the most exhausting thing you can imagine.ldquoThey said lsquoYou canrsquot earn pound a week and keep your Carers Allowancersquo, so they took it away. It was money that helped, now itrsquos gone.Gillian, , who lives in Whiteinch, manages meals and other expenses using the pound budget the family have left once the main bills have been paid.Itrsquos brutal, she says, but she knows there are others worse off among the  people who visit the Glasgow South East Foodbank where she volunteers and where her husband Ryan, also , works full-time.At home she feels the pressure that comes with trying to clothe and equip Hannah, , Mickey , Grace,  and six-year-old Bruce for school.ldquoThere are so many expenses that add up, she says. ldquoThings like home economics classes which parents now have to pay for.ldquoEvery last Friday of the month itrsquos lsquodress-downrsquo day. The kids take pound each for charity, which starts to add up when you have a couple of kids.She finds around pound a week to cover outings for Mikey at school and with a support charity, and is trying to help Hannah achieve her Duke of Edinburgh badge goals, including buying waterproof jackets, camping gear and boots.ldquoYou donrsquot want them to miss out on things, she adds. ldquoThat just leads to children feeling isolated and left out.

He had just declared the Conservatives to be the party of work, of \"labour\".\"We are the builders,\" he added, \"and to build, you must build on solid foundations.\"The chancellor did not have new taxpayer cash to pay for all this construction. But he did have pensioners money.His aim: to re-style and refocus  local government pension funds, the future incomes of hundreds of thousands of public-sector workers, in to engines of economic regeneration.Six superfunds, together worth some pound billion, would be big enough to save hundreds of millions in fees and costs and pay for new schools, bridges, homes and prisons.Party loyalists cheered.Less than a year later Osborne was gone, his political career ended by Brexit. Whitehall become engrossed in the complexities of leaving the European Union. And pension funds underwent their own tricky process of pooling and merging.Gradually, though, the funds started to put money in to infrastructure. Local Government minister Rishi Sunak last summer said he wanted the funds to put a th of their investments in to infrastructure. That would be pound billion.Watching the English reforms were Scottish ministers. They, like Osborne, hoped to unleash the power of council pensions on the real economy. Last summer, with little fanfare - and no cheering supporters - the Finance Secretary, Derek Mackay, a former council leader himself, announced an independent consultation on how to do so.Should Scotlands  funds - worth more than pound billion at a recent count - merge in to one  Should they team up to run pooled inidual investment funds, rather like what is happening in England  Or should they simply work more closely together And what,anything, would such reforms do to lure some Scottish pension money out of global financial markets in to real-world investments closer to home.The stakes could barely be higher. Just matching Englands aspiration of investing a th of local council pension funds in to infrastructure could release pound billion, or pound. billion. That is a lot. To give just a sense of the scale, it would be enough to pay for three more Queensferry Crossings, four Aberdeen bypasses or five new super hospitals such as Glasgows Queen Elizabeth.Any government, local or national, has a wishlist of capital projects but, in an age of austerity, far from always the access to cash to carry them out. And that is not just a current budget problem. Getting credit is also an issue.The Scottish Government has a capital borrowing cap of poundm a year and no more than pound billion overall. There are ious schemes - such as the old private finance initiative or the new non-profit distributing- for bringing in private money. And the UK Government has also been contributing through City Region Deals.Late last year, Mackay signaled capital projects of some pound billion in his - budget. But he and others want more. So getting well-funded local government pension funds to invest - usually infor safe, fixed long-term s - is a priority. Some funds, such as the giant Strathclyde oneare already putting pensionersrsquo money in Scottish bricks and mortar. The problem  Some of the funds are just too small to front the kind of money needed on their own. Hence talk of reform north of the border.Mackay, in an introduction to the formal consultation, clearly set out that he was not looking for institutional change for changersquos sake. ldquoThere are currently excellent examples of fund authorities collaborating on infrastructureprojects in Scotland, he said. ldquoWe look to fund authorities to improve their already positive impact on the economy thereby contributing further to sustainable economic growth, creating more jobs and supporting the delivery of key capital infrastructure needs.The stakes are not just financial. They are also political. And human: around , Scots are in the current  schemes. The SNP has already seen at least one centralizing project - the national police force - become a political football. A single scheme - already referred to by some as Pensions Scotland - would have to endure unprecedented scrutiny over its decision-making, not least on whether its investments were ethical. Even more pooling of funds to pay for national projects could thrust council pensions on to the political front line. ldquoThere is a risk pensions would look like a piggy bank for politicians,rsquo said one source.So political insiders -not pensioners and the general public - seem wise to this potential hazard. That may explain why Mackay and the Government are treading carefully. Informed sources say the Finance Secretary and his team have no firm view on the future shape of local government pension funds. They are awaiting the outcome of the consultation, which closed last month.An independent body, the Pensions Institute, is collating responses. Its findings will go to a an obscure body, the Scottish Local Government Pensions Scheme Advisory Board, sometimes this spring. The board, made up of councillors and trade unions, will then report back to Mackay. But battle lines are already drawn.THE EVANGELISTSimon Watson is leading the charge for a national scheme. He is a Unison organiser and, among other things, one of the trade unionists representing future and current pensioners on the advisory board.He sees lsquoPensions Scotlandrsquo as an opportunity to get better s from more ethical investments and still boost the real economy with jobs-creating infrastructure. That is a lot of bang for your council pension buck. Mr Watson said he thought government and local government was taking reform seriously. ldquoWe were concerned there might be a strong view of people looking after their own backyards,rsquorsquo he said, ldquoto keep their own schemes for the sake of it rather than the greater good. But there is a wide iety of views.He added: \"Because of the state of public sector finances, there is an overwhelming case for merging the funds and the wider benefits that will give to spending and services. We hope Mr Mackay will look a long those lines.Better performance for pension funds is fiscally signicant. Mr Watson reckons improvements in s could offer austerity-hit local authorities the chance to pay less in employer contributions. Even a modest drop in such payment could help council bottom-lines. In - they paid nearly pound billion into schemes.Watson reckons too many people - including private funds managers and advisors - are taking a cut out of pensions as things stand. So a central fund, he believes, would be more efficient, with more in-house expertise on everything from emerging markets equity funds to Scottish prison construction.But it is not just the pension funds that need more expertise, said Watson. Public bodies need to be better at pitching. He said: ldquoThere is an lsquoaskrsquo of the Scottish Government to co-ordinate better the investible opportunities.ldquoA national pension fund would still have to get due diligence done. Most of what would come from the government would be relatively low risk. Slightly lowerthan sone of the more high risk opportunities. The Forth Bridge might have been an opportunity. If there was an increase in council housing, that might be an opportunity too. Or more road building, or business parks to develop new industries.Unison, like other unions and some campaigners, have a problem about where some of their pensions are currently invested. ldquo People paying in to the funds have an ethical view,rsquo he said. ldquo If relatively small funds are looking at ethical investments they tend to be very conservative about it. They tend to say lsquooh, norsquo,something is a slightly higher risk. So the err on the side of caution, not making the best opportunities of ethnical investments, We think a single fund would give greater expertise in that.FRONTLINE VIEWRichard McIndoe is not convinced that big is beautul. Or more ethical. And he runs Scotlandrsquos largest council pension fund, the mighty Strathclyde, worth around pound billion, including a billion already in infrastructure.McIndoe is no enemy of the unions but he stressed that they do not need to worry about pensions, which are underwritten by councils and so will be paid however badly the funds reform. He said: ldquoThere is a mismatch of risk. If you start using the pension fund to promote campaigns in a political way, who pays the costsit goes wrong  It is the local authorities side. Not the trade union members. A national fund, he suggested, ldquowould give unions a lot of influence with much less repercussion.Strathclyde, as the biggest fund, has taken the biggest heat on its investment decisions. Should it have money in fossil fuels  Or arms firms  Or cigarettes  All three are important parts of the Scottish economy. McIndoe bemoans what he calls ldquoa lack of proportionality in criticism.He said: ldquoPart of the trade union argument is that you can create a bigger fund and it would have more influence. You can pretty much have the same influence by just jointly signing a letter. You have still got the same number of shares whether two pension funds own then or one. So it is a bit of a hollow argument. Strathclyde was one of the big institutional investors which late last year forced Royal Diutch Shell to link executive bonuses to carbon targets . His fund also championed living wage. Like Mr Watson, he thinks this makes business as well as ethical sense. But he is not trying to change the world ldquoWe are an active investor, he said. \"An activist is slightly dferent. But we play an active role.\"McIndoe has been watching events in England. He has not been impressed. ldquoBecause they have been forced to collaborate with each other, because they have going through a process of very hurriedly getting together, it has been chaotic and we have kept out of it.Strathclyde, which is administered by SNP-run Glasgow City Council, has made a formal submission to the review. Essentially it echoes McIndoersquos view that size is not everything. It said: ldquoMerging investments is certain to involve a concentration of risk. A full merger of Scottish funds might have slightly increased probability of success. But size is no guarantee of success, and the impact of failure would be very signicant. The biggest potential downsize  A ldquoconcentration of risk, said the fund.It added: ldquoA full merger of Scottish funds could increase investment in infrastructure, but this would depend on the investment strategy of the merged fund and those managing it. However, merging the funds simply to achieve more investment in infrastructure, which is not a primary pension fund objective, would be a perverse decision.Strathclyde, meanwhile, wants to keep council pensions in council control - evenin reality only  of Scotlandrsquos  local authorities have administrative power over the funds. It said: ldquoAt the extreme, merger into one fund would be likely to break the direct link between the scheme and local government by taking the fund out of local government control.Strathclyde is big. So big McIndoe does not consider investments of under poundm. Yet he stresses that big funds can do badly. Britainrsquos two largest, Universities Superannuation Scheme and the British Telecom Pension Scheme , manage about pound billion each. Both have funding deficits of more than pound billion.So which Scottish pension fund does best  Mr McIndoe laughs. That, he said, would be tiny Orkney.SMALL IS BEAUTIFULScotlandrsquos smallest local government pension fund is also the countryrsquos most successful, at least in terms of funding. A private fund runs Orkneyrsquos fund, which around poundm under management. It makes great s. But it invests nothing in infrastructure. Why  Because, it says, there are no opportunities on its scale.In a formal response to the current consultation, it said: ldquoThe principle impediment to investment in infrastructure for small funds is the lack of suitably attractive investment opportunities that are packaged in a manner that make them easy to access.It added: ldquoIf there were a suitable investment vehicle that offered the pension fund a route into infrastructure investment with an appropriatefor the level of risk, that might be persuasive.Like Strathclyde, Orkney does not like the principle of reforming pension funds to squeeze out more money for government projects. That, it said, ldquocould be a hugely costly mistake.It added: ldquoThose charged with stewardship of the pension schemes require to invest the funds for which they are responsible to earn the maximumpossible for the level of risk taken. Just as investments in arms, fracking, fossil fuels etc may be controversial,they are on balance the best investments to meet the objectives of pensions funds then that is where pension funds are invested.Orkneyrsquos take-away  If government wants pensions money, then it should put together some wrappers.Back in Glasgow Mr McIndoe conceded his fund would be willing to team up with smaller ones, opening up projects to smaller stakes. That he said would be ldquoabsolutely feasiblehellip.and desirable.WORKING TOGETHEROver in Edinburgh, the Lothian Fund is already co-operating, with neighbouring Falkirk, Fe and the Borders and even Northern Ireland. Between them, these funds have put some poundm in to infrastructure.Unlike Strathclyde and Orkney, it is very keen on a national fund, on a voluntary basis. Why  Because it believes governance would be cleaner and costs lower.Lothian already has an inhouse investment team, the only one of its kind, and a model for the kind of central fund Unison wants.The fundrsquos formal response echoes Mr Watsonrsquos concerns about massive hidden costs in the pension system. It said profits to private fund managers and advisors could be as high as poundm a year. Current accounting rules, it said, mean fees are under-reported. Its conclusion  As much as poundm in fees could be saved a year by taking expertise inhouse.It said: ldquoThe lack of transparency of investment fees and general lack of comparability of other aspects of the pension schemes hinders policymakers.The big advantage of a single find would, it said, would be a ldquogreater proportion of assets being managed in-house. \"Further, the benefits from initial savings will compound over time.TRANSPARENCY FEARMoreover, Lothian is concerned about the transparency of decision-making too. Some critics are concerned that existing structures contain a conflict of interest between funds and their administrations. But Lothianrsquos take is that many of the people who oversee funds, including councillors, do not know what they are doing. It said: ldquoGovernance is also inefficient. In the region of - people are involved in the pensions committees, many with limited knowledge and experience of pension matters.Its formal response to consultation suggests collaborations and pooling of funds could raise even more issues over accountability. It wants a bespoke governance system for a national fund. Why  Partly because it wants to guard against what it called a potentially increased risk of central government interference. That hazard was cited by almost every source contacted by The Herald on Sunday, including those in government.SHOW ME THE DEALSWhat do hard-nosed pension funds managers think when they hear politicians, whether at Westminster or Holyrood, seek more cash for projects  Some are already investing, and not just British ones. The fund representing Ontario teachers, for example, has been ploughing money in to UK bricks and mortar ndash and even Scottish gas networks.Strathclyde Pension Fund director Mr McIndoe summed up: ldquoShow me the deals. Show me the terms. What are we putting in  What are we getting back  In what period  Would we invest more in infrastructure  On the right terms, we would.ldquoFor us, infrastructure is fairly new. We have not been doing it that long. For most UK investors, it is fairly new. We will increase that investment. But how quickly we will increase our allocation will depend on the opportunities available."},{"url":null,"title":"revoking-article-50-is-the-only-sensible-course-says-sir-john-major","story":"Sir John, who led the country between  and , wrote in the Sunday Times of his support for a second ballot of Britainrsquos membership of the European Union, adding the Government allowing a no-deal Brexit would be ldquomorally reprehensible.Theresa May is preparing to put her Brexit blueprint to a vote in the House of Commons next week with former Brexit minister Dominic Raab saying Britain should be prepared to leave with no arrangement in place.Writing that the isions between people on both sides of the referendum debate have become ldquobitter and entrenched, Sir John added: ldquoThe cost of a no-deal Brexit to our national wellbeing would be heavy and long-lasting.ldquoThe benefits are close to zero.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Sunday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More than  young people were at the heart of it, and planned a calendar of sporting, music and cultural events for all ages to enjoy.A world-first initiative, YoYP was a commitment made by the Scottish Government. Young people worked alongside decision-makers to make sure they were involved in the creation of government policy.This year, they established a Youth Commission which examines mental health services. They will have a greater say in their education with the creation of a Scottish Learner Panel, and hold those in power to account with the launch of the First Ministers Question Time for children and young people.YoYP was delivered in partnership with local and national organisations including schools, youth work services, EventScotland , Young Scot, Scottish Youth Parliament, Children in Scotland and YouthLink Scotland.More than  young ambassadors volunteered their time to challenge the negative stereotypes of their peers.

I realise that the build up in favour of Michael Ross, trying to prove his innocence, has given the book another layer — whether it’s correct or not. I was shocked that there had never been a book on it, but I think that’s because it’s over such a long time period.”On the evening of June , , Bangladeshi waiter Shamsuddin Mahmood was shot dead at the Mumutaz restaurant in Bridge Street, sparking a full-scale murder investigation. Though questioned at the time, it was another  years before Michael Ross was apprehended for the crime. On June , , Mr Ross was convicted of murder at the High Court in Glasgow. Last year, he admitted attempts to escape HM Prison Shotts, where he is currently serving a -year sentence. This came shortly after news that high-profile lawyer Aamar Anwar would be representing him in an appeal case.“It’s an incredible story,” added Mr Clarkson.“I think it’s one of the most extraordinary true crime stories in UK criminal history.”Having already secured a book deal, Mr Clarkson has long-term aspirations of bringing the story to Netflix which he says, has shown interest in making a six-part series about the case. For now, he is trying to get folk who were involved in the case, or who knew Shamsuddin Mahmood or Michael Ross, personally, to come forward.“I’m really interested in speaking to witnesses who were in the restaurant, to Michael’s ex-girlfriend, and to anyone who knew Shamsuddin when he was living here in Orkney,” he explained.“To be fair to the people who are fighting for his innocence, they deserve a voice as well, and they will get a voice in my book, because what I’m trying to do is look at it from all angles. I also want to make sure that Michael Ross’s family get the right to reply.”If you have information which could be valuable to Mr Clarkson, you can contact him on  , or by emailing wensleyclarkson@yahoocopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Wherever you are in Scotland – all you need is a clear night, a dark place to watch and a dose of good luck!Scottish Natural Heritage are currently running a competition to find the best image of the lights, with budding photographers in with the chance of winning a  Scottish Natural Heritage calendar.Jonathan Swale, who works on Shetland for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a keen watcher of the aurora borealis.“The winter months are the best time of year to see the northern lights and the best time is a couple of hours either side of midnight,# he said.#This amazing spectacle is caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gas particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress. We are following the findings of the health and safety report that highlighted a number of issues. Our insurance section has also advised us that the council would be unable to insure the monument for this public kind of use.The petition can be viewed at www.change.org p the-highland-council-open-the-hector-macdonald-monument-to-the-publicWhat do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupSunday  Jan  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It creates the impression that voters are now entirely tribal.If you take any issue of the day and feed it into Twitter or Facebook, the responses of users of those s will be of the black and white iety. Social media is no great enabler of nuance.But the truth is that huge numbers of people neither use social media nor feel the need to align themselves with a particular camp. The floating voter still exists, we just don’t hear much from her because she’s getting on with her le in the real world.If you want proof that social media isn’t the be-all-and-end-all of political debate, consider the matter of Scottish independence. Spend even a few minutes on Twitter and you’d be forgiven for thinking that Scots think of nothing other than the constitutional question.It’s undoubtedly the case that independence – whether of the Scottish or Brexit iety – is the major issue of our political times but it remains the case that other things matter, too. Not least among these important factors is the perceived competence of those who would lead us.This is a truth that should, right now, be focusing the minds of those closest to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP came to power at Holyrood in  not solely thanks to the votes of those in favour of Scottish independence. Rather, the nationalists enjoyed – and, to a lesser extent, continue to enjoy – the backing of voters who support the maintenance of the United Kingdom.The most signicant factor in creating this apparent contradiction was the widely held belief that the Labour Party had lost its way. Cast your mind back to the  election and you’ll recall how then SNP leader Alex Salmond and his team went to great s to reassure Scots that a vote for the nationalists need not be considered a vote in favour of independence. Instead, insisted Salmond, a vote for the SNP should be seen as a vote for competent government.That SNP reputation for competence may not have quite the shine it once had but – in part, thanks to Scottish Labour’s inability to mount anything like a serious opposition – it remains. The First Minister’s handling of the allegations of sexual harassment levelled by two female civil servants against Salmond stands to destroy the goodwill that has kept the SNP in power for  years.Last week’s Court of Session ruling that the Scottish Government investigation into these allegations was procedurally flawed was bad enough. The women who brought forward complaints have been left high and dry while the taxpayer faces a £,-plus bill after the government accepted it had failed to follow the process to the letter.But more was to come.We have known since the allegations about Salmond surfaced last year that Sturgeon met him on a number of occasions during which, she says, she made it clear to him that she could and would not intervene in the case.During First Minister’s Question Time on Thursday, the First Minister was forced to expand on that.It emerged, under questioning from acting Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw, that during the first of these meetings – of which no minutes exist – Sturgeon’s Chief of Staff, Liz Lloyd, was present. Lloyd – a government employee whose status as a special adviser permits her to act on party matters – was wearing her SNP hat that day, Sturgeon told MSPs.The First Minister was adamant that what was discussed that day was not a government matter. I wish her good luck sustaining that line.A meeting between the First Minister and her predecessor to discuss allegations of sexual misconduct raised by government employees is very much a government matter. To suggest otherwise is insulting.This is a view shared by some who back Sturgeon.“She should never have agreed to meet him. Simple as that,” says one party insider whose loyalties lie with the current FM rather than her predecessor. Another veteran activist, with identical sympathies, asks who in the First Minister’s team thought such meetings were at all appropriate.These Sturgeon loyalists make the point that her handling of this matter is exactly the sort of thing that began to chip away at trust in Scottish Labour.I’m bound to agree.Sturgeon – who refuses, beyond saying that she told him she would not intervene in the case, to go into detail about the discussions she had with Salmond – is now testing the goodwill of voters who believed her to be competent and honest. Without minutes of the meetings, we can only take the First Minister’s word that she acted appropriately. That’s a big ask.Despite the best efforts of Team Sturgeon to deny the existence of a civil war in the SNP over this issue, it’s perfectly clear that hostilities between supporters of the First Minister and supporters of Salmond represent exactly that. The SNP is now angrily ided. People have picked sides.A number of high-profile Salmond supporters – former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill, former health secretary Alex Neil and former presiding officer Tricia Marwick among them – have come out to bat on his behalf.The response from the Sturgeon camp has been rather muted.One party insider says: “Nobody on Sturgeon’s side is used to war. They don’t know how to handle what’s happening.”That same source makes the point that, when Salmond was first minister, Sturgeon, former SNP communications chief Kevin Pringle and former MP Angus Robertson formed a tightly-knit unit that advised and, to some degree, controlled their boss, and asks who performs the same role for the current party leader  It certainly appears that Sturgeon would have benefited from having people on her team who would have advised against meeting Salmond.SNP infighting over the Salmond investigation will only get bloodier, while the First Minister’s role in matters can only further erode her credibility with the moderate mainstream voters she needsthe nationalists are to win the next Holyrood election.We may now be witnessing the beginning of the end of the SNP’s dominance of our politics.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855762.1547332157!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond s team claim top civil servant misled public","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The country#s top civil servant is facing fresh claims that she sought to #materially mislead# the public over the collapse of the Scottish Government#s case against Alex Salmond last week.And Government documents seized by the Court of Session before they were made public are “legal dynamite”, according to the former first minister’s team. : Alex Salmond case: How likely is an inquiry into Nicola Sturgeon’s actions Salmond won a dramatic victory over the government he once led at the Court of Session last Tuesday after it emerged that an inquiry into claims of sexual harassment against him by two women was “unlawful” and “tainted” by an appearance of bias.The fall-out has left Nicola Sturgeon fighting for her political le after damaging revelations came to light about a series of meetings with Salmond – three in person and two phone calls – to discuss the investigation while it was under way. : Alex Salmond case: Former SNP deputy says ‘one person party’ to blame for ‘tragedy’Taxpayers are also facing a legal bill of up to £, after Salmond won full costs and he is also considering suing the Scottish Government.Salmond has already called on Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans to quit over the implosion of the case. A statement released by Evans immediately after the case insisted that a new “procedure” to oversee complaints against current and former ministers is “robust”.Salmond had been challenging this procedure before a flaw in the way it was applied came to light. It emerged the head of the investigation, before being appointed to the role, had previously been in contact with the two women making the complaints and advised them on the issue.It was on this basis that the government case collapsed on Tuesday and Evans stated afterwards: “All other grounds of Mr Salmond’s challenge have been dismissed.”But this has been rejected by the former first minister.“The Permanent Secretary is in denial and her claims are materially misleading,” a spokesman for Salmond said.“She tried to suggest that the court rejected the arguments made by Mr Salmond which is absolutely the opposite of what occurred. “The whole action was dismissed on the basis of the Scottish Government’s concession that they had acted unlawfully, as well as all of the expenses, and therefore we didn’t need to go any further in comprehensively winning the case. “The Scottish Government case collapsed at the very first hurdle. They would have fallen at all the other hurdles as wellthe case had continued to the full hearing.” But a Scottish Government spokesman said last night: “The court order is clear. It says that all other aspects ofSalmond’s petition were ‘dismissed’.“The Scottish Government co-operated fully with the court process for the recovery of documents. “The full picture only became clear in December  as a result of work being undertaken to produce documents in advance of the hearing.“It was in light of that work that we agreed to settle the case. As the Permanent Secretary has made clear, the single procedural flaw which led to this decision is deeply regrettable.”A separate police investigation has been launched into the claims made against Salmond dating back to December  when he was first minister. But once this has concluded Evans has made clear that the Scottish Government could re-launch an inquiry into Salmond – using the same procedure introduced in late  in response to the global #MeToo movement.This could raise the prospect of a fresh legal challenge from Salmond over his original contention that the process used to investigate him was unfair. He has previously claimed that he was denied access to witnesses and blocked from presenting his own side of the case. The “flaw” over the links between the investigating officer and the two women need not have brought about the collapse of the government’s case. Ministers could have sought to have the case remitted for further action. Although this would still have meant a symbolic victory for Salmond, it would none the less have allowed the government to restart its inquiry, this time using the correct procedure. Salmond’s spokesman added: “Their legal position was hopeless which is why their case collapsed before we even got to the first day of the hearing and interestingly before all the internal documents they were so reluctant to produce and required to be extracted from them by a commission ordered by Lord Pentland were discussed in open court. These documents are legal dynamite.”It emerged that members of Sturgeon’s inner circle, including chief of staff Liz Lloyd, were among those to give evidence in the case before it collapsed.Ministers have denied any link between this and the government conceding defeat.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855756.1547330852!/image/image.jpg","title":"grassroots to send ultimatum to corbyn on brexit","story":"Senior Labour figures will face immediate pressure from party members to change party policy and oppose Brexit within hours of the meaningful vote on Theresa May#s deal with Brussels.Key allies of Jeremy Corbyn at the top of the Labour party will be confronted with grassroots demands for a second EU referendum less than  hours after the Commons vote, set for Tuesday, which the government is expected to lose heavily.The Prime Minister will have three days toto the Commons with a “plan B” for Brexit, during which time opposition parties will also seek to impose their will on the next steps in the process.The Labour leader has resisted pressure to fully embrace a second EU referendum that could reverse Brexit, saying his priority is a general election.But this week saw confusion at the highest levels over what Brexit policy Labour would take into that election, with members of the shadow cabinet and Scottish party leader Richard Leonard facing criticism for failing to spell out the position, while shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said an extension of Article  was now “inevitable”.A survey of Labour members found that  per cent want a second referendum on EU membership, and polling suggests the party could be particularly badly hit in ScotlandLabour backs May’s Brexit deal.The YouGov poll for the People’s Vote campaign found that support for Labour in Scotland would fall by  percentage points to  per cent, costing all but one of the party’s seven MPs north of the border.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell and the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rebecca Long-Bailey, will hear direct pleas from party members for a robust anti-Brexit policy at a key policy meeting scheduled for Wednesday at Labour HQ in London.The two Labour front benchers sit on the Economy, Business and Trade Commission of the party’s National Policy Forum , which will consider submissions from ordinary members, elected Labour officials and constituency Labour parties.The open submissions process has been flooded with demands for a People’s Vote since Corbyn gave an interview to thesaying that Labour would press ahead with Brexitit won power.

Jeremy promised that his leadership would be led by the membership, so the membership is making it clear that he must drop his support for Brexit.“It’s vital that NPF reps and the leadership listen to what the members are saying, come out firmly against any type of Brexit, and back a People’s Vote.“If we fail to do so, the voters will notus to power.”As well as submissions from constituency parties, iniduals have made their views known, with one warning the party’s policy on Brexit “is no longer tenable”, while another writes: “If we go into the next election offering Brexit-lite, just as we did offering austerity-lite under Ed Miliband, we will lose the next election.”Several other influential figures within the Labour movement sit on the Economy, Business and Trade Commission, including union chiefs Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison, and Tim Roache, who leads the GMB.

Leonard says it marks the latest failings by the SNP Government to “stand up for Scottish workers”.He said: “Scotland desperately needs a plan to deliver fair work to protect our workforce from unscrupulous bosses and insecure work.“The SNP Government has failed to publish its fair work action plan at the same time as trying to cut trade unions out of pay negotiations and failing to pay the living wage. That tells you everything you need to know about its priorities.“Labour was founded by the trade unions and will always protect and promote workers’ rights. “We will put workers at the heart of our plans to revive our industries, ban zero-hours contracts and create the high-wage, high-skill jobs of the future.”Over the past year, the SNP Government has come under signicant pressure over public sector pay. Education Secretary John Swinney has been criticised over claims he sought to bypass trade unions in pay negotiations by writing directly to teachers during the pay ballot. It has also emerged that Prestwick Airport – which has been bought over by the taxpayer, but is run at arm’sfrom the Scottish Government – was not paying the living wage.

Mayflower will also run separate trips from Inverness during the tour to Wick and Thurso, and Kyle of Lochalsh, at extra cost.A spokeswoman for organisers The Steam Dreams Rail Co, said: “This time, instead of the short trips around the Fe Circle, we are offering a four-day tour to Inverness, with Flying Scotsman and sister locomotive Mayflower double-heading on the first day from Edinburgh to Inverness, via the Forth Bridge and the Highland main line.”She said the price of the tickets reflected the extra cost of having two locomotives, with the trip part of a nine-day tour from London.Steam Dreams owner David Buck said: “Flying Scotsman has not been to Inverness in recent history, and to experience the two locomotives performing at full power over this steeply-graded railway will be a great prospect for all lovers of steam. “It is the first time we have given passengers from Scotland an opportunity to join part of one of our nine-day tours.”The visit will be Flying Scotsman’s fourth consecutive annual foray north of the border. Other previous excursions have been on the Borders Railway.The locomotive made a special trip from London King’s Cross to York on Friday as a memorial to Sir William McAlpine, who was credited with rescuing the engine and paying for its restoration when he bought it in .Flying Scotsman was designed by Edinburgh-born Sir Nigel Gresley to haul the same-named Edinburgh-London express on the east coast main line.It was the first steam locomotive to reach mph, in , and set a record for the longest non-stop run, of  miles, in Australia in . The engine was restored at a cost of more than £ million by the National Railway Museum.Further Flying Scotsman trips are expected to be announced shortly by the museum.Steam will also come to Aberdeen this summer with Tornado, which featured in Paddington  and on Top Gear, hauling a new service called The Aberdonian.The locomotive, built in , will run the service in March, August and September, withfares costing between £ and £.Graeme Bunker-James, operations director of The A Steam Locomotive Trust, which runs Tornado, said: “We are extremely proud to be launching ‘The Aberdonian’ series of new special steam-hauled trains.”The Jacobite steam train between Fort William and Mallaig will also , with daily trips between April and October. Sir Peter Hendy, chairman of Network Rail, which runs tracks and signals, said: “Tornado is a shining example of British engineering, reflecting the country that invented railways, and giving pleasure on every trip to thousands of Scots as it traverses Scotland.“I hope this series of trips becomes a permanent feature of the Scottish railway scene.” The Bo’ness-based Scottish Railway Preservation Society has yet to announce whether it will repeat last year’s steam-hauled trips over the Forth Bridge and round Fe.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855706.1547316841!/image/image.jpg","title":"dani garavelli lost leader gives corbyn cause to cringe","story":"Shortly after MPs voted against the government to limit the Treasury#s powers in the event of no deal, Steve Anglesey, journalist for the pro-Remain newspaper The New European, tweeted a photograph of Yvette Cooper with the caption: #The leader of the Opposition has turned up.#Like all good political sideswipes, this one took its power from its pinpoint accuracy. With her amendment to the finance bill, the backbench MP had done more to try to safeguard the country from the worst-case scenario than Jeremy Corbyn has done in months .Cooper’s move means that, should the government want to use some of the specic powers in the finance bill to implement no deal, it would have to first give parliament a vote or apply to extend article . It does not prevent no deal but it does make it more dficult to navigate and so, arguably, reduces the likelihood of it taking place.With typical churlishness, Corbyn failed to acknowledge Cooper’s achievement in a statement he said Labour was taking every opportunity to prevent no deal, without ever mentioning her name.Other people, however, were more appreciative. And not for the first time, the words “ only” were repeated as a lament to past leadership elections and missed opportunities. Corbyn’s simmering resentment of his former rival is only to be expected. Cooper may have come a poor third when she stood against him in the  she may have been pushed to the backbenches by those who despise her as a Blairite, but her quiet strengths still serve to accentuate Corbyn’s blustering weaknesses.The Tory government could not have done more to sabotage itself and its citizensit had assembled the finest minds in the country and asked them to draw up a step-by-step plan. Any political leader worth a damn would be annihilating Theresa May at PMQs every week and charting a clear route out of the current crisis.Instead, Corbyn has dithered and delayed. Every trap that has been set for him, he has fallen into every internal problemhe has exacerbated. If an opportunity to land a blow has presented itself to him, he has squandered it. Thus the Tory party staggers on critically wounded, but with no-one willing or able to put it out of its misery.At no point has Corbyn come up with a coherent strategy on Brexit. His own MPs and MSPs have been in a constant state of confusion over the party’s position on everything from whether or not to stay in the Customs Union to whether or not to support a second referendum.Now Corbyn has called for a general election to break the deadlock yet such is the internal disarray that, on Thursday, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard was unable to say whether the party intended to campaign for or against leaving the EU.As Corbyn and his shadow cabinet have been failing to bring down a government already on its knees, Cooper has been distinguishing herself in the Home Affairs Select Committee and on the back benches. When May announced the snap general election in April , Cooper won plaudits for her caustic put-down. “The Prime Minister said yesterday that she was calling a General Election because parliament was blocking Brexit, but three-quarters of this parliament voted for article  and two-thirds of the Lords voted for article , so that’s not true, is it ” she said.“A month ago she told her official spokesman to rule out an election and that wasn’t true either, was it  She wants us to believe that she is a woman of her word but isn’t the truth that we cannot believe a single word she says ” She attacked the government on its decision to end a scheme to take lone child refugees and single-handedly forced the resignation of Amber Rudd during the Windrush scandal with one quietly delivered, but dynamite question: “Targets for removals [deportations] – when were they set ” she asked. Rudd denied any such targets existed – a statement quickly established as  – and so she had to go.Admittedly, Cooper comes with baggage. As her critics never tire of pointing out, she previously backed a stricter asylum regime and did not oppose the government’s Immigration Bill. She also voted in favour of the Iraq War and lobbied to restrict benefits for new EU migrants.Having said that, were Brexit to happen, without or without a deal, the situation for EU migrants would be considerably worse. In a Westminster and Labour Party with a superfluity of egos and a dearth of semi-competent operators, at least Cooper comes across as serious, able and committed.Corbyn posits himself as the voice of the working classes, yet he has done little to try to stop the economic havoc that is about to be unleashed upon themCooper is a dreaded centrist, but understands voters were sold a lie, and that the most vulnerable will be the hardest hit.Accused of being unpatriotic for trying to make it more dficult for the Prime Minister, she insisted it would \u2028be unpatriotic to do anything , given the damage a no-deal Brexit would inflict.For this, former Daily Mail journalist Quentin Letts derided her as earnest and compared her to a kindergarten teacher talking down to her pupils. She saw herself, he said, as more in tune with morality than others. Looking round Westminster at the moment that seems a reasonable assumption. After all, the bar isn’t set very high. Amidst the preening and braying of the Brexiteer donkeys, and the student politics posturing of the Corbyn camp, her sober,slightly sanctimonious, manner is a breath of fresh air.After Cooper’s performance in the wake of the snap general election announcement, Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell was seen mouthing the words “leadership pitch”. In the end there was no third leadership contest it is impossible to know whether Labour would have won had she been at the helm.But Cooper’s achievement in forcing the first of two humiliating government defeats means she is once again a contender, with some admirers suggesting she should be asked to head up a Government of National UnityGiven there is less unity in Westminster than there is at the average wedding scramble, this seems unlikely. But she does now feel like a leader-in-waiting.Last weekend, one poll suggested Labour would lose by a landslideit backed Brexit in any forthcoming general election and yet even this does not appear to be focusing minds.On the evidence of the past few days, Cooper is exactly what the party needs: a woman capable of taking on the Tories with a grit, determination and charm that Corbyn lacks a woman who understands that the point of being in Opposition is to try to get yourself back into power.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"a","story":"SOME lucky folk had an amazing view of a pod of killer whales off west Unst last Friday.

And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen.

Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1375347.jpg--.jpg?1546939693000\n","title":"vandals target dunclug play park","story":"A CHILDREN’S play park came under attack last weekend in the Dunclug area.Vandals daubed white paint over the mesh fence with splatters damaging the play surface.Offensive slogans were scrawled along the fence in what locals believe could be in relation to drug activity in the vicinity.The attack is believed to have happened overnight between Sunday evening and Monday morning.One of the slogans read F.A.G while another said D.T.U.S Scum.A local resident said there could be a link between the incident and the supply of drugs which is endemic in the area.The resident said it is believed that children or young teenagers were not the perpetrators.They said due to the size of the letters, which they estimate as being around six foot, it is believed that the unsightly graffiti is the work of adults.

Former client Helen Boyd shared her journey highlighting the very positive impact the Family Nurse Partnership programme had on her le.She described the challenges and hurdles encountered from discovering she was pregnant, to adjusting to motherhood and ultimately moving into full time employment. She described how instrumental the supportive relationship she shared with her family nurse was in enabling her to manage these challenges.Congratulating the new graduates, Roberta Brownlee, Chair of the Southern Trust said: “Being a parent is of course so rewarding but as all of us mums and dads know it isn’t always easy. We all want the best for our children and sometimes we can worry that we aren’t doing our best.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8756119.1546445050!/image/image.jpg","title":"st colman s have a super tour","story":"Local families attending the Family Health Initiative at St Colman#s Primary School recently visited Moundview Eurospar in Dromore for a supermarket tour.The Family Health Initiative is a healthy lestyle programme delivered by Early Years- the organisation for young children in the Southern Trust and is funded by the Public Health Agency.During the supermarket tour both parents and children took part in a fantastic scavenger hunt to find all the healthy food items on their sheet.

For the Kennedys – parents of seven children – found their maisonette home in Divis Flats in ruins when they ed to it just hours before Christmas.Ceilings and walls had been damaged, the bathroom completely wrecked and doors had been pulled off their hinges and were lying on the floor. “I was heartbroken when I saw the destruction,” said Mary as she sat in the home of her mother, Mrs Mary Brennan, in another part of Divis Flats. “The children told me that British soldiers had raided the house almost every day. Once they searched the house from top to bottom no less than five times,” she said. Mary who was interned in Armagh Jail since May last went on to say that the family would have to find a new home.“Our house just couldn’t be lived in now,” she said. As she sat with her husband Billy, interned for the second time in June last, she described how she was called to the office of Amagh Jail Governor Whitaker at  o’clock Christmas Eve morning.“I had no idea I was going to be released. Girls are often called to the office to receive the silliest of messages and I assumed he was going to tell me that a visit to Billy in Long Kesh which I had asked for had been turned down,” she said. “He read me a handwritten letter from Merlyn Rees which told me they were doing me a big favour by letting me out to be with the children at Christmas. I asked about my sister Evelyn Gilroy, who has two young babies, but he said that she was being kept in internment.”n THE milk Marketing Board has warned that all milk being obtained by householders during the present strike by milk roundsmen should be boiled before use.At present milk is being supplied to the area by farmers who are bringing it straight from their farms and the Board has warned that there could be a serious health hazardunpasturized milk is used without being boiled.Milk should be brought to boiling point and cooled as quickly as possible, says the Board. It should not be kept for long periods and bottles and other containers used for collecting milk supplies should be sterilized in boiling water before being used.Bernie to stand for electionBERNADETTE McAliskey is likely to be a candidate for the new Irish Republican Socialist Party in the forthcoming Northern Ireland Convention elections. She is already a member of the temporary executive of the new party.The Irish Republican Socialist Party is a breakaway from Official Sinn Féin. It is led by Wicklow County councillor Seamus Costello who over the years has been a prominent member of the Officials, but in recent times in dispute with the organisation.The breakaway formed itself into a new party following the recent Official Sinn Féin Ard Fheis. John Joe McGirl, recently released from Long Kesh, told a meeting of Leitrim County Council that he was familiar with the thinking of the UVF and the UDA and he was glad to see that many of them were “coming to see the true light”.He said that this was so even though some of their politicians were not serious about peace and were trying to wreck the current efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The Sinn Féin county councillor went on to say that the policy of the republican movement was not to ask England to put up a white flag but simply to request them to disengage from this country.The issue was now in the hands of the British Government and he hoped they would come to the right conclusion.He said he was very pleased that the clergy had become involved in the peace drive and added that nobody desired peace in this country as much as the Provisional IRA. ‘End this evil’ call as some internees are freedAS  internees were released from Long Kesh and Armagh on New Year’s Eve the Association for Legal Justice called for an “end to this evil of internment”.Among those freed this week were three men who had been held as internees since August  . They were Lenadoon man Gerry Maguire, Mickey Donnelly from Derry City – one of the ‘hooded men’ – and Art McAlinden from South Armagh.Mother of two, Mrs Evelyn Gilroy , from Divis Flats, was reunited with her children Coletteand Deniseminutes after she had been released from Armagh Jail where she has been interned since May. She was the only girl internee released from Armagh.Former Sinn Féin TD John Joe McGirl, who was lted on Andersonstown Road as he travelled to Milltown Cemetery from his County Leitrim home for last Easter’s commemoration ceremony was also set free. His internment had brought protest resolutions from local councils throughout Ireland, including Leitrim County Council of which he was a member.In a comment on the releases Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee joined the ALJ in demanding the immediate closure of Long Kesh.Speaking on behalf of Andersonstown rent and rates strikers, the Committee welcomed the releases – but it warned that the strike should continue until the last internees has been set free.The resistance group’s statement said that the spirit with which the internees endured their torture and suffering was admired by all.“There will be no thanks from us, or from the people of Andersonstown, to the British government for these releases. The men and boys in Long Kesh and the girls in Armagh should never have been parted from their families in the first place,” concluded the statement.There has been ied reaction to a plea from Fr Des Wilson that policing in areas from which the RUC is excluded should be put in the hands of local community associations.Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee has described Fr Wilson’s suggestion as “forward looking” but in a statement the Committee goes on to warn that no police service which co-operates with the RUC will have the support of the people of Andersonstown or the Falls. “There is no chance of the RUC ever being accepted in Andersonstown.”Meanwhile, RUC men took advantage of the truce to set up a road block near the main gate of Falls Park on Boxing Day.

Voting began with the opening episode that aired on Tuesday, and John’s performances will be fully broadcast on Tuesday th.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, John said the show was a massive career opportunity.“It’s more exposure than anything,” he said.“It’s a TG show, which is mainly down south, and it’s good coverage because I want to break into the south in a way. This TV show will be a great  to get my name out there and to get heard. “It’s crazy. I’m a big fan of Johnny Brady, he’s super singer and the band that he’s working with are super talented, so to get to work with him is amazing.”He continued: “It has been really good. It was hard getting used to the TV cameras and being involved in the whole makeup thing, but it’s good craic. I was getting slegged about the makeup the whole day, but it was good craic. It’s all part and parcel of the show. “The whole experience has been phenomenal. You really feel like a star in the way that they treat you.”No stranger to competition, John is a three-time winner of our own Best of the West contest, but he insists he is not overly concerned about a victory on this occasion. However, he admits that it“would be a big bonus” and is asking the people of Belfast to give him their support.“For me it’s about networking and the doors it could open,” he said. “There was a girl on last year called Chantelle Patton, she didn’t win it but she ended up in Nashville this year – that’s the kind doors it could open.“If local people support me it would be great. Even winning Best of the West three years in a row was crazy, it really takes you aback when people are voting for you. I would love a wee push on this one. It would be really much appreciated.

This year it was disconcerting to read disclosure of NIO briefings from  refer to friends and colleagues being named along with their organisations.The Committee on the Administration of Justice was the subject of one of the documents, a document we know was shared with MI and Task Coordinating Group. The human rights organisation was described as “biased” and Professor Kieron McEvoy in particular was singled out as being considered “strongly biased and opinionated”.The CAJ highlighted human rights abuses of actors to the conflict, and in particular the state, and were highlighting evident abuses and questioning the lack of remedy avenues for victims. That year the CAJ highlighted, amongst other issues, the signicant questions of state collusion in the killing of solicitor Pat Finucane in  and the summary executions of three men at Sean Graham’s Bookmakers at the bottom of the Whiterock.The questions they raised then have not gone away and that the CAJ and Professor McEvoy are still engaged in the intense efforts to secure remedy for victims of violations is no coincidence.The question of “unsympathetic opinion makers” in West Belfast also taxed the minds of NIO officials prompting them to make a note on people best avoided. Those people included Professors Mike Tomlinson and Bill Rolston and Father Des Wilson. The purpose of the memo was not to state the obvious, but to urge others not to talk to them or engage with their analysis. The memo includes reference to Glór na nGael, Falls Women’s Centre and the Divis Joint Development Committee.This was the era of political vetting. When those included in such memos were not just ostracised from conversations, but were denied access to funding, demonised in the media and ultimately branded as part of a “pan-nationalist front”. This policy was part of the wider militarised agenda of isolating a community, censoring its representatives, and denying community organisations legitimacy.That deliberate approach in turn allowed for wider justication of shoot to kill policies, the use of plastic and rubber bullets, torture and degrading and inhumane treatment of suspects in holding centres and those imprisoned. In  the end game policy of collusion with loyalism was well under way. Loyalists had been armed, provided with information on targets and given cover. Targeting of the nationalist and republican community was based on the distribution of military files, the use of state agents, and these types of briefings.Then Secretary of State Douglas Hurd MP stated that “some community groups, or persons prominent in the direction or management of some community groups, have sufficiently close links with paramilitary organisations to give rise to a grave risk that to give support to those groups would have the effect of improving the standing and furthering the aims of a paramilitary organisation, whether directly or indirectly”.The killing of John Devine, the previous year, whose business had been in Conway Mill, had clearly not mitigated the policy.In any truth process these briefings, their context, their outcomes and all who played the game should be the subject of intense scrutinywe are to really understand our conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast city hall turns red in campaign by irish language speakers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They point to that contentious episode as the spark that invigorated their campaign for an Irish Language Act.Campaigners insist an Act was promised in the  St Andrews Agreement that paved the way for the DUP and Sinn Fein to enter a historic powersharing arrangement at Stormont. The DUP contend that it did not sign up to an Irish Language Act in , and the commitment was instead the product of a non-binding side deal between republicans and the UK Government.Mr Mac Giolla Bhein added: “The parties are going to reconvene for talks at some stage and when they do the first item on the ‘to do list’ is most certainly the issue of Irish language rights.“This community isn’t going anywhere, we are not leaving the streets, this issue isn’t going away.“The sooner parties sit down and grapple with this, the sooner the DUP lt their objection to this and agree to fulfil a promise that was made in  the better.”"},{"url":null,"title":"book reveals number of catholics in dup and uup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Majority of UUP members loathe DUP and dont want a merger \"In each party you could count the Catholic members on the fingers of your hand, but it will surprise many people that the DUP is ahead of the Ulster Unionists,\" Prof Tonge said.He said it was surprising that the UUP had no programme in place to attract Catholic unionists as most members would like a more religiously representative party. \"Both unionist parties are currently beyond the pale to Catholics,\" he added.Around , UUP members were interviewed by the authors.Prof Tonge said the party was considerably larger than the DUP, boosting a membership twice the size. However, while almost a third of DUP members claimed to be \"very active\", only one in five UUP members did.The partys strength was in Northern Irelands least populated county, Fermanagh, where around % of members lived compared to % of DUP members.Prof Tonge said the UUP urgently needed to recruit in the more heavily populated counties of Antrim and Down. He revealed that, contrary to popular myth, the UUP had recruited young people in recent years.\"Fteen per cent of its members joined in the last seven years. The party has been very successful in Queens and the Ulster University. Where it needs to do better is with ordinary, non-university young people,\" he said.The UUP boosts more women members than the DUP - its % male to the DUPs %. But Prof Tonge said the centralised nature of the DUP meant greater control over candidate selection by the leadership with women heavily promoted.\"The rise of Arlene Foster to become Northern Irelands first female leader is symbolic of the DUPs deliberate attempts to modernise the image of the party in the face of their unionist rivals,\" the book states. \"Whether Arlene Foster would have been able to rise through the ranks of the UUP will never be known, but is still a question worth asking.\"Although the partys politicians are increasingly liberal on the issue, only % of UUP members support same-sex marriage. However, % believe Northern Ireland should have the same abortion laws as Britain.Whereas Free Presbyterians are the largest denomination in the DUP, they account for just .% of the UUP, which is split almost evenly - % to % - between the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church. UUP members are religious with % attending church weekly, although thats lower than the DUPs %. Almost six in  would mind a religiously mixed marriage in the family a little or a lot.The Orange Orders influence in the party is on the wane. Only % of councillors are members compared to % in the DUP, and % of MLAs . Around % of both parties members are in the Orange Order. Just over half of UUP members would transfer to the DUP in elections. A third said they would give a lower preference to the SDLP and % to Sinn Fein. Once an integrationist party, the UUP is now very pro-devolution which has % membership support compared to % for direct rule."},{"url":null,"title":"civil servants planning northern ireland emergency fuel operations","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But this did not extend to reopening the deal signed off at a special summit on November .\"No-deal would be a catastrophe both for our British friends and for continental Europeans. So every effort must be made between now and Tuesday to bring this important issue to a good conclusion,\" Mr Juncker told reporters.He refused to speculate on what form the EUs \"help for Mrs May\" would take.Observers in London said they expect the Prime Minister cannot recruit enough pro-EU Labour MPs to offset the loss of the  DUP MPs and dozens of her own party members, and Northern Ireland remained a crucial issue.Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionists have accused the Secretary of State of destabilising Northern Ireland and emboldening Sinn Fein by her reported remarks that a no-deal Brexit will lead to a border poll. MEP Jim Nicholson said Karen Bradley had made a \"series of ill-judged and irresponsible comments\".The DUP and the TUV accused her of scaremongering.Mr Nicholson said: \"Recent reported comments by the Secretary of State on a border poll simply help to embolden Sinn Fein and create further destabilisation in Northern Ireland.\"I am appalled by the Secretary of States behaviour - she is doing enormous damage to Northern Ireland.\"However, Mrs Bradley insisted that the withdrawal agreement was the \"best thing\" for the future of the Union.She declined to be drawn on reports that she had warned Cabinet colleagues that a border poll would be much more likely in the event of a no-deal Brexit.But she said she was aware of her obligation to call such a referendumthere were evidence of a change in public opinion here in favour of reunication.On a visit to Belfast yesterday, she was asked whether a no-deal would make a border poll more likely.She responded: \"Ive said that I believe the best thing for the United Kingdom, the whole United Kingdom and the Union of the United Kingdom, is leaving the EU together as one UK with a deal. That is the best thing for the UK and that is what I am focused on delivering.\"Asked about her reported warning at Cabinet on Tuesday, Mrs Bradley said: \"I am not commenting on what may or may not have been said at a private meeting.\"But I am well aware of my statutory obligations under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement and I am well aware the constitutional status of Northern Ireland is a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.\"My job as Secretary of State is to deliver a deal that gets us out of the EU as one United Kingdom and is good for everybody in the United Kingdom, and that means everybody in Northern Ireland.\"Thats what I am working to deliver.\"TUV leader Jim Allister claimed little heed was paid to what Mrs Bradley said in Northern Ireland, although \"republicans are probably drawing comfort from her support for the backstop betrayal and foolish talk about a border poll\".DUP MP Gavin Robinson insisted that Theresa Mays deal undermined the Union.\"If Karen Bradley was really sincere she would support calls to bin the backstop,\" Mr Robinson said.Sinn Fein MLA Jemma Dolan said: \"The people of the North have already rejected Brexit and they should be given the opportunity to decide which union they want to belong to.\""},{"url":null,"title":"full rollout of universal credit benefit delayed in northern ireland until","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Volunteers would check the validity of fuel permits presented by iniduals identied by their organisations as a priority to receive fuel from designated filling stations, the letter said. \"Details must be recorded of the amount and type of fuel purchased so HQ staff can track demand patterns. \"Training will be provided and they will explain the scheme to customers, thus leaving filling station staff free to dispense fuel and take payment.\" The last time serious disruption happened to the oil industry here was in  during the loyalist Ulster Workers Council strike in protest at the Sunningdale Agreement.Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said: \"The advocates of a no-deal Brexit should be left to staff the pumps and explain the disaster of a no-deal Brexit.\"A statement from the department said for many years it had worked closely with industry. It added: \"This process is not new and is a routine exercise to bring the resource back to the required capacity.\" Due to staff changes it was considered \"prudent\" to reissue the call for volunteers."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland schools asking parents for 60 per month to plug","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have now exposed all attack tunnels dug by Hezbollah from Lebanon into Israel. pic AUzNbmCCM— Israel Defense ForcesJanuary , Lt Gen Conricus said the latest tunnel originated from the Lebanese border town of Ramyeh.It was  metres deep and ran  metres inside Lebanese territory and also “dozens” of metres into Israel, he said. It included stairs, a rail system and a wide a passageway that allowed for the movement of equipment and a large number of forces.The tunnel would be destroyed in the coming days, Lt Gen Conricus said, adding that while more tunnels still existed on the Lebanese side of the border, this effectively marked the end of the ambitious military operation.“We have achieved the goal that we set out to achieve a month and a half ago,” he said. “According to our intelligence, there are no longer any cross-border attack tunnels into Israel.”Israel and the United Nations say the tunnels violate a ceasefire resolution that ended a devastating war between Israel and Hezbollah in . Lt Gen Conricus says the UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unil, had been updated on the latest development.The powerful Shiite militant Hezbollah, which acts independently in Lebanon, has yet to comment on the Israeli discoveries.Israel has long called for a crackdown on the Iran-backed Hezbollah, a heavily armed mini-army that is believed to possess an arsenal of some , rockets that can reach nearly all of Israel. In recent years, Hezbollah has been bogged down in fighting in Syria on behalf of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government. But with that civil war winding down, Israeli security officials fear Hezbollah is refocusing its attention on Israel.In the wake of its discoveries, Israel has asked the international community to impose tough sanctions on Hezbollah and begin to act against its state-within-a-state operation in Lebanon.The military said its forces would stay deployed along the border area to monitor for any other possible underground activity, and said it holds the Lebanese government responsible for everything happening in its territory."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit british government proposals described love letter dup","story":"CAPTION:Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson pictured yesterday at the Green Line in Cyprus with party adviser Collette McAllister."},{"url":null,"title":"derry strabane road reopened colllision","story":"The main Derry to Strabane road has reopened following a collision.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe road had been closed between Ballymagorry and Magheramason following the collision which occurred around .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"foyle hospice weekly prize draw winner","story":"This weeks winners in the Foyle Hospice Prize Draw are -

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist. It wasnrsquot until I was in my late s, and with a lot of encouragement from my we, that I realised I could make a career out of something I had always done as a hobby.bull Aidanrsquos work can be admired throughout the month of January up to February  at Down Arts Centre and admission is free..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devlin and Quinn selected by SDLP for upcoming elections  ","story":"THE SDLP has chosen sitting councillors Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn to defend their seats in the Mournes district electoral area at the forthcoming local government elections.Their nomination was confirmed at a recent selection meeting when the party also confirmed its candidates in the Downpatrick, Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas.Candidates for the Newry, Crotlieve and Slieve Gullion area will be selected shortly as the SDLP aims to increase its membership on Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Devlin said it had been her ldquotremendous honour to serve the people of the Mournes DEA over the past five years.ldquoAs someone who grew up with a strong sense of community and reconciliation, I believe the policies I have pursued during my years on council have adequately reflected that, as have the results, she explained.ldquoThis year will be busy as I am expecting another baby as well as contesting an election. But I enjoy a challenge and I hope that my constituency work on the ground spanning the past  years will stand by me as we approach polling day.Cllr Quinn said there was much more work to be done and he trusted that the public willboth him and his party colleague in the Mournes area to continue with this vital task.He added: ldquoI look forward to continuing to represent the needs of the public at council and ensuring that nobody is left behind.South Down MLA Colin McGrath paid tribute to the ing local government candidates.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem.

McGrady responded with a second point for Down, but Donegal piled on the agony and further scores from McGonigle, with a goal, Hugh McFadden and Oisin Gallen left the visitors comfortable winners.Down had late points from Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe, a member of the county U- squad last season, and Devlin, but they were mere consolation scores as Donegal ran out comfortable winners.Down: Jonathan Parr, Shane Annett, Ruairi Wells, Ryan McAleenan, Gerard Collins, Benny McArdle, Ryan Johnston , Aaron McClements, Daniel McCarthy, Rory Mason, Conor Poland, Jerome Johnston , Pat Havern , Ciaran Harney .Subs: Conor McGradyfor McArdle, Paul Devlinfor Mason, D McClements for Harney, Corey Quinn for Havern, Owen McCabefor Aaron McClements.Donegal: Martin McGinley, Caolan Ward, Brendan McCole, Conor Morrison, Eoin McHugh, Eamonn Doherty, Peadar Morgan , Hugh McFadden , Martin McElhinney , Ciaran Thompson , Niall OrsquoDonnell , Caolan McGonigle , Martin OrsquoReilly , Michael Langan , Jamie Brennan .Subs: Jason McGee for Thompson, Paul Brennan for McHugh, Lorcan Connor for Morrison, Oisin Gallenfor OrsquoReilly.Down -Donegal -McKENNA CUP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17322267.local-volunteers-served-more-than-dinner-to-the-lonely-on-christmas-day/resources/images/9280310.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

They point to that contentious episode as the spark that invigorated their campaign for an Irish Language Act.Campaigners insist an Act was promised in the  St Andrews Agreement that paved the way for the DUP and Sinn Fein to enter a historic powersharing arrangement at Stormont. The DUP contend that it did not sign up to an Irish language act in , and the commitment was instead the product of a non-binding side deal between republicans and the UK Government.Mr Mac Giolla Bhein added: “The parties are going to reconvene for talks at some stage and when they do the first item on the ‘to do list’ is most certainly the issue of Irish language rights.“This community isn’t going anywhere, we are not leaving the streets, this issue isn’t going away.‘Yellow vest’ protest held in Belfast city centre Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The sooner parties sit down and grapple with this, the sooner the DUP lt their objection to this and agree to fulfil a promise that was made in  the better.”try catch            ..

It will be his second stint as president.However, there was an opposition boycott of the vote, and international bodies severely criticised the running of the election, with the EU’s High Representative saying the process went ahead “without complying with the minimum international standards for a credible process, [and] not respecting political pluralism, democracy, transparency and rule of law”.Mr Shannon, who has raised the issue of Venezuela in the Commons in the past, said the country is in a “dire situation” and “as a result of his election will get even worse again”.He added: “[Sinn Fein] should be questioning whether the election was fair and did it give people the opportunity to vote in a fully democratic method like we have in this country, for instance. I’d suggest to them that it didn’t.“I think they’ve a question to ask themselves.“I think it’d be beholden better of Sinn Feinthey were highlighting the total autocratic power the president has and the way he carries out policing in his country, to the detriment of people who do not have any human rights.“I’d be saying to Sinn Fein that they should be looking at their support for Maduro on the grounds of his legacy so far of devaluing human rights, his actions against protestors, the claims and allegations of torture and so on that have taken place, and of a country whose economy is falling apart.“It’s a country ruled by a despot who has no regard whatsoever for his citizens.”Last year’s vote happened amid a massive economic crisis, with Human Rights Watch reporting Venezuelans face “severe shortages of medicine, medical supplies, and food”.There is a also intense hostility to dissent Amnesty International recently condemned “excessive and undue force to disperse protests”.And a report by the UN commissioner last year documented abuses which included killings carried out by the security forces during protests, “high levels of impunity” for those security forces, the use of “arbitrary detention”, and the use of torture Venezuela’s attorney-general has given a tally of  people killed in security operations over a  month period in -, and it is estimated by the UN that over . million people left Venezuela between  and  under Maduro.Among the international observers of the  election process was Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard, who said in a statement at the time that it was “an honour” to have been invited by Venezuela’s National Electoral Council to take part, adding: “Sinn Fein have consistently supported the highest standards of human rights for all people.”And in a Sinn Fein statement this week annoucing attendance at the inauguration, Conor Murphy said: “Nicolas Maduro Moros was democratically elected by the Venezuelan people to serve as their President during the term -. We’ll use our presence in Venezuela to express our continuing solidarity to the people supporting their legitimate demands to build a just and equal society free from foreign intervention.”In response to Mr Shannon’s criticism, Sinn Fein said it “will take no lectures from the DUP on human rights when they are propping up the Tories who plan to repeal the Human Rights Act and are committed to a disgraceful denial of rights to large sections of society in the north”.try catch            ..

HELEN MCGURK reports on the dwindling appeal of smokingMany readers will remember theold days, when smoking in enclosed, fug-filled spaces, like aeroplanes, buses and offices, was perfectly fine. Ex smoker Jason ShankeyTime was, everyone smoked my parents did, my primary schoolteacher didso did my -year-old friend, who pilfered Woodbines from the pockets of hergranny’s housecoat. On television we watched snooker players, like belligerent Belfast boy Alex Higgins, puffing away between potting, as a thick pea-souper of smoke hung over the auditorium, whilst darts’ players like Eric Bristow and pudgy Scot, Jockey Wilson, both smoked like trains. Cars were equipped with fiddly ashtrays and cigarette lightersit was a rite of passage for all children to burn themselves on a car cigarette lighter at least once before the age of .I remember going to visit relatives and a cake stand of cigarettes would be passed around along with the tea and butterfly buns. Perfectly normal hospitality. I also recall puffing on sweetie cigarettes as my friends and I played the popular game of the day, ‘-a-Day Habit’. The candy cigarettes were banned in the UK in the s, and we were forced to find our kicks where. From black and white movies, with iconic smokers like James Dean, Lauren Bacall and Marlene Dietrich, to teen rebellion, smoking has lit up our culture and had a certain cachet until we realised it could kill us. Further back, smoking was once such an esteemed activity that it was awarded its own jacket: waist-, with a shawl collar and fashioned out of velvet or silk, it was designed to protect gentlemen’s normal attire from the scent of smoke, which was an offence to the ladies. Most forms of cigarette advertising are now banned in the UK. However, in their prime, they were influential works of art. Remember the one where the cuddly St Bernard would toddle over a mountain with some St Bruno tobacco in a pouch around his big, fluffy neck for a man stuck in a snow-bound hut, or the slogan ‘happiness is a cigar called Hamlet’.During my university days I decided to take up smoking. All the witheringly cool students smoked so I thought it would be hip to follow suit. What a mistake. Smoking is not big and it’s not clever. Never mind the expense, it makes you stink like a pub carpetand can give you cancer. Sinn Fein urged to re-think support for Venezuelan ‘despot’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Eventually I wised up, and with the help of nicotine patches stopped the awful habit. As the graphshows cigarette smoking is declining. In Northern Ireland, with . per centof the population classied as smokers. That figure is down from  per cent just two years ago. Another person who decided to kick the habit and believes the start of a new year is a good time to start, is businessman Jason Shankey, who runs a group of hair and skincare salons in Belfast.‘‘I started smoking at  years of age. I suppose at the time it was because my mates were all smoking and we used to buy singles at the petrol station. By the time I was in first year I was buying a packet of , spending my money on cigarettes instead of lunch. The habit gradually crept up on me then. I couldn’t imagine myself going through the day without smoking. It was an addiction but I didn’t see it like that. I enjoyed smoking. I liked the flavour and the sociable aspect of it, as it was a lot more sociable years ago. ‘‘By the time I reached fth year I was smoking  a day, though at weekends, that probably went up to  a dayI was having a drink. I never really thought about the detrimental effects it could be having on my health. Of course I’d seen the anti-smoking ads and the warnings on the packets but I was addicted, so I turned a blind eye.‘‘Then in  I just got fed up with smoking and decided to quit. I managed to stop for a year. But I wasn’t in the right mind-set to stop. I put on five stone because my appetite increased and I was eating more food in place of the cigarettes. I remember being on a skiing holiday and we were in an Austrian hotel. People were smoking around me and I could smell it, so I went out and bought myself a packet of cigarettes. I also remember leaning over to tie my ski boots and not being able to reach down because I’d put on so much weight. That also influenced my decision to go out and buy the cigarettes. Within six months I was back to my normal size again. ‘‘I know now that it was all down to the way I approached giving up smoking. The second time I quit, my thought process was completely dferent and I had the help of a great book, The Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. It sets you up psychologically for success by telling you it’s not dficult to stop smoking. The marketing around smoking may not be visual now but there’s still a lot of hype around stopping and smokers are led to believe that it’s really tough to quit. One you realise this isn’t the case, it becomes easier. He also compares smoking to putting your lips on an exhaust pipe and inhaling, which is basically what you’re doing, just a dferent context. ‘‘The toughest part of quitting is up until day three but by day  you’re no longer addicted. That’s only three weeks out of your le. When you think about it like that, it makes it a lot easier. I’d quit smoking by the time I’d finished the book. People fear giving up but it’s all down to you having the right mind-set. I haven’t smoked since, not even one.The other thing that really helped me was the Android app QuitNow! Pro, which tells you the date you stopped, the money you’ve saved and the health benefits. I’ve saved £, from stopping smoking! And when it comes to health benefits, I’m now % on all of them, bar lung cancer but I’m % of the way to being the same as a non-smoker when it comes to the risk of developing lung cancer.Of course, Jason says when it comes to giving up cigarettes, everyone is dferent. ‘‘What works for some may not work for others, but anyone looking for advice on how to quit should look up Cancer Focus NI’s website cancerfocusni.org cancer-prevention smoking .’’try catch            ..

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Though he had asthma from birth, Tiernan didn’t appear to suffer any attacks until he was aged . While he used the blue Ventolin inhaler, he never used the brown one, which is a steroid, according to his dad Stephen. When Tiernan came to his mum and dad’s room for help that morning, they tried everything to help him but he was gone within  minutes.Tiernan GreenHis tragic passing plunged Lurgan into shock and grief as many of his friends and school mates struggled to come to terms with the death of such a young and energeticman.However, his parents and brother and sister felt the unimaginable pain of his loss most deeply.Mum Donna admits to struggling to deal with the loss of her ’” handsome young son.Donna said: “As the second anniversary approaches of the death of my darling son Tiernan, it really just seems like yesterday.The Green family Tiernan with Mum Donna with youngest son Ryan Dad Stephen , Mise and Stefan“No mother or father should have to lay their child to rest.It should be the other way about.“Over these two years I have seen my family change and, when I say this, I mean we all have changed as people.I can honestly say our lives will never be the same again! “It’s weird how grief works on the mind. One day I might be ok or maybe for a few days. Then, all of a sudden, you might see something or hear something that makes you think you your beloved son.Landowners of town centre anti-social hotspot should be targeted say SDLP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"“This might be you for a few days, feeling so low that all you can think about is him and how you lost that person and how he died. “ I lie most nights thinking about what happened that morning, I would find myself having to sit back up again as I get quite anxious and then I am the one left trying to control my own breathing.“I went myself for counselling once but found that it wasn’t for me. My husband attends a meeting called Anam Cara and he finds it helps! “I find with me doing all my own asthma awareness and speaking out at dferent events- this, for me, ismy therapy this is what helps me -a mother who has lost her child.“We, as a family, lean off each other through the grief.“When I see my daughter is having a bad day I will speak to her and say THIS is ok. You are allowed to cry. You are allowed to have your quiet days when you don’t talk that much.“I know this is grief because I see it myself. I am the one who witnesses it. I am here for my family and they are here for me so we are all in this together.“I will still continue to raise as much awareness as possible and try and save as many lives as I can. I don’t want any other family to go through what we have.“As long as I am living my son’s name will always live on through others,” said Donna.The familyhas raised around £, for ious charitiessince Tiernan passed away.The first year the family raised funds for Craigavon area hospital buying a special machine for respiratory help costing more than £k.They also raised cash to renovate the Family Room at the hospital with Tiernan’s plaque and new furniture and a TV.Last year they raised money for Anam Cara - a counselling service for families suffering from grief.Stephen attends Anam Cara regularly and it has helped him deal with the intense grief he felt at the loss of his son. Indeed he has become so close to the group that the organisation has asked him to become a spokesperson for them.Donna has dealt with her grief by raising the profile of asthma and campaigning for greater awareness on how to treat the illness so other families don’t have to go through a similar dreadful tragedy.“I have been getting messages from people across the country, thanking me for helping to save their son’s le or even thank you for saving my own le.It’s unreal.“It has brought me great comfort knowing that I have helped,” she said.The family also have organised a truck run over the past two years and are planning another this May. It has raised thousands of pounds.However, on this second anniversary, the Green family will remain close to each other, helping each other deal with the loss of such a beloved son and brother.If you would like more support and information on Asthma, please check out the websitewww.asthma.org.uk get-involved campaigns government northern-ireland If you need help with grief you can contact Anam Cara via their website www.anamcara.ietry catch            ..

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34344455.jpg","title":"delta air lines buying  new airbus jets","story":"Posted on Monday January  by Ulster Business US carrier Delta Air Lines is buying an additional  part-Belfast made passenger planes, it has emerged. The order for the Airbus A- jets – formerly Bombardier CSs before the firms agreed a tie-up – brings Delta’s order book to  planes. The latest deal could be worth as much as .bn, according to the book price. However its likely the sale price is signicantly less than that. The wings and signicant parts of the aircraft fuselage are made in Bombardier’s Belfast plant. \"Delta has always been deeply focused on the passenger experience, and the A fits perfectly with that philosophy,” Christian Scherer, Airbus chief commercial officer said. \"You just need to take a look at Delta’s cabin on the A to see it’s setting a new standard in short-haul flying. The A will provide passengers with a level of comfort and convenience that makes flying a pleasure again, while meeting Delta’s high standards for efficiency and reliability.” Gil West, Delta’s chief operating officer, said: “These additional A aircraft will continue to strategically enable Delta to refresh our fleet, drive further advances in the customer experience and serve as an excellent investment for our customers, employees and shareowners for Delta into the next decade. “We look forward to taking our first A- in  at the Airbus assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"outlook  uncertain times may lead to a business downturn","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Its already the New Year and economist John Simpson examines whats facing the Northern Ireland business community in the next  months The early weeks and months of  pose more dficult prospects for managing the economy and maintaining and boosting business continuity than key decision makers would either wish for or normally expect. In addition to the uncertainties of managing the economy, which face the Government, there is a huge element of uncertainty about the reliability of the conventional economic forecasts. How disruptive will be the consequences of Brexit implementation  Northern Ireland goes into  with an economy that is growing, but growing only very slowly. While the UK economy has recovered the output levels lost during the recession of the past decade, Northern Ireland in - still has overall output % lower than in . In contrast, the Irish economy has regained a rate of economic growth that is better than the UK and compares well with the EU average.There is now an emerging picture of the UK economy growing more slowly than the EU average and, within the UK, Northern Ireland has one of the slowest regional improvements, lagging behind the rest of the UK. The international prospects for  are now forecast to be less expansionary than last year and the OECD points to slower trade growth in  linked to disruption of international trade partly linked with the more restrictive trade policies of the US and also to tightening changes in monetary and fiscal policies.Northern Ireland’s slower growth is set to continue. Political instability and Brexit uncertainties continue to be a concern. The most recent annual business enquiry, reporting on the outcome in , shows the stark contrasts. In , the non-financial business economy here expanded at a rate of .%: the rate for the UK was .%. All this in the run up to the finalBrexit deal which is widely expected to have a further initial adverse impact and, later, may go either way to give a boost or restrain, further ahead. Brexit, in whatever form it eventually takes, adds a considerable degree of uncertainty. The conventional models to anticipate how the economy will behave are attracting a degree of scepticism well beyond just the margin of error that might be expected. When otherwise well established and well understood agencies such as the Office of Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England attract ill-informed criticism, usually by critics who have little understanding of the inter-action of the main economic iables and the professional competence of the authors, the consequence is a lack of rational measured influence.Critical political comments on prospects for the economy in  are heavily discounting the negative assessments. As the year evolves, the answer to the non-professional critics will lie in the evidence as the unfolding trends confirm that pessimism about the impact of Brexit is well merited.At the risk of being challenged,the conclusion proves misplaced, the prospects for Northern Ireland in  are not reassuring.  In the opening days of ,business decisions can be postponed, chances are that they will. Writing in December for an analysis of business prospects in the following year is, this time, more hazardous than any other recent period. No matter what decisions are made in Westminster, each month in  will reveal a new set of influences each, in dferent ways, recalibrating the economic arithmetic for the months ahead.The real cautionary ideal would be to ‘lock the doors and keep everything inside’ until the external economic environment settled down. Of course that would make a risky situation even riskier. Business managers must manage their business and ‘locking the doors’ is a guaranteed crisis or collapse. Businesses will keep trading, responding to changing market pressures, and hoping that the unexpected economic and political shocks are manageable.The least complicated and most reliable basis for decision making in the early part of  is that there continues to be a major degree of uncertainty about how the economy will respond to events, some of which may have erse implications. Decisions can often be readily postponed. Delay can be less stressful than anticipation of the uncertain.The critical uncertainties include:The final form of Brexit to be agreed by the UK Government and the EU Have the exchange rates for the pound and euro stabilised How will the Bank of England respond: base rate could further increase After Brexit, how will the UK Chancellor respond in the next Budget The answers to these uncertainties are critically important for the UK and, specically, Northern Ireland. To a signicant degree, people in Northern Ireland are not in a position to set the answers. UK politics will be influential. However, that is not an excuse to argue that all responsibility lies outside local control.How will the Northern Ireland institutions respond If there is still no devolved Executive, the ‘no decision’ making drt will be an ever increasing negative influence. If, perchance, the Executive is reformed, how long will it take to regain lost momentum  Capital budgets in particular have slowed gradually as old contracts were finished. New contracts will take time to move from approval ‘to spades in the ground’.Even more critical, the private sector of the economy may be disappointed as domestic consumers continue to take a precautionary stance as they react to an increase in job insecurity and take a more pessimistic view of their expenditure needs.The prospects for  can be summed up either as challenges or opportunities awaiting sensible momentum. Can the negative Brexit messages give way to a more widely supported Brexit settlement  Can the negative impact of the local political stand-points be by-passed as the evidence of mutual gain from an agreed and restored Executive are realised  Is there a will to introduce a constructive programme for Government which really puts the economyfirst  The economic forecasters have good reason for their warnings of a post-Brexit bump. Even critics of the forecasters will have to accept that pervasive and persuasive logic must be acknowledged. It is time to ‘batten down the hatches’ and persevere.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mo_1.jpg","title":"two tech firms setting up in belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Two UK tech firms are setting up shop in one of Belfast’s newly revamped city centre buildings, Ulster Business can reveal.Tech firms CYTI and Firemelon, which are both owned by David Corney, will take on the fourth and fth floors of Moneda House, at Wellington Place.
