By the time we reach a second planet – probably in the 2030s – we’ll probably have a base or two on the moon as well. But will people ever live beyond Earth permanently?Hazards abound on the red planet, a world that is colder and drier than Antarctica and without the luxury of breathable air. Andy Weir provides an excellent picture of the struggle to survive in his novel The Martian. Kim Stanley Robinson takes a deeper e with his Mars trilogy. The series follows the first 100 settlers, a hand-picked crew of scientists and engineers who gradually transform the climate. There is plenty of engineering and biology, but Robinson broadens into philosophy when he explores how some settlers want to keep Mars pure and red, while others view the life that greens the planet as a gift from humanity. And alternative history is just around the corner when another wave of colonists arrive, dreaming of breaking away from planet Earth.Women may require fewer calories, reducing kilograms and cost for any mission launching from Earth, but governments have proved unwilling to let them take the lead. Martha Ackmann’s The Mercury 13 tells the story of the women Nasa trained as part of the Mercury programme in the 1960s, and how the US president Lyndon Johnson denied them the opportunity to fly. It wasn’t until 1983 that Sally Ride became the first US female astronaut in space, and the sexist culture at Nasa is the backdrop for To Space and Back, a book for younger readers that is as informative as it is aspirational. She explains what it’s like to eat, sleep, bathe or use the toilet in zero gravity – subjects that Mary Roach expands on in her lighthearted study of living in space, Packing for Mars. Sex, in particular, is fraught with difficulties in zero gravity, where Newton’s third law can make action and reaction a messy affair.Our dreams of voyaging in space are even older than that. Jules Verne’s 1865 adventure story From the Earth to the Moon is eerily prescient. More than a century before Apollo 11, Verne imagines a giant cannon built in Florida with great controversy and at great expense, which launches three men in a capsule. They fire retrorockets to land on the moon and eventually return to splash down in the Pacific Ocean. The next few centuries may see us travel to Mars and beyond, but human explorers will find that writers have already planted the flag of the imagination on all these new horizons.• Spacefarers by Christopher Wanjek is published by Harvard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f530d7d6f92ac58cc2e43a53c7c527fe35bc66/0_44_6377_3826/master/6377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbdb7ac0392d81b760cc0b8fa1a281ca","title":"liberation through hearing rap rave rise of xl recordings richard russell review","story":"The music business is full of kneejerk hyperbole, but XL Recordings, the independent London label run by Richard Russell, remains the most extraordinary enterprise.You’ll have heard of Adele, whose albums 19 and 21 came out on XL, and the Prodigy, the company’s first major international success. Dizzee Rascal made his first three groundbreaking albums there, back when grime was an entirely underground, non-album phenomenon. In various ways – discovery, collaboration or licensing – the label Russell came to run has abetted the careers of MIA, the rapper Giggs, the White Stripes and Vampire Weekend. And that’s before you count the XL-associated label Young Turks, with the xx, Sampha and FKA twigs, the more recent arrival of Thom Yorke and Radiohead, and XL’s more recherche acts: the fluid electronic composer Arca, or the Cuban-French duo Ibeyi. The records Russell himself produced for poet Gil Scott-Heron and soul singer Bobby Womack remain landmark late-career highs for both the departed vocalists.The success here has familiar elements – doggedness, kismet, sound financials. But much of XL’s less conventional modus operandi is down to Russell, a benign auteur-svengali who makes his own beats and once spent 20 hours in Switzerland hand-painting record sleeves with eccentric dub pioneer Lee “Scratch” Perry. These records were not sold, but bartered for other creations sent in by like-minded souls.Russell’s obsessive zeal for the craft of music-making – and his respect for musicians – is laid bare in this book, which mainly covers 30 years of business decisions, good and bad, interleaved with his own backstory. Much as XL is not your average label, Russell’s is not your usual memoir, full of glitz, excess or scandalous anecdotes. He is a former raver uninterested in telling anyone how large he once had it.If Liberation Through Hearing were not the story of one of the most interesting cultural endeavours of the past 30 years, you might call it a dry read. Unengaged at school, Russell started out as a hip-hop obsessive and then became a rave entrepreneur, going so far as to have his own novelty hit (The Bouncer) as Kicks Like a Mule, and spending a pivotal time in New York serving apprenticeships in record shops and DJing.But although he is clearly an intense guy who’s seen interesting times, Russell under-emotes throughout these adventures in sound. His knowledge of, and love for, music is deep, but somehow these passions often read flat on the page – somewhere between understatement and a matter-of-factness better suited to explaining why one took the A10 north-east rather than the M11.It’s left to the reader to meet Russell halfway with the emojis. He recounts being at Adele’s 31st birthday party in Los Angeles, at the house where The Godfather was filmed. Russell meets Jay-Z and is stunned into silence when the dealer turned rapper turned mogul starts talking to him intensely about XL’s roster.You get the feeling that all of Russell’s words have been weighed very carefully throughout, so as not to reveal too much about the many, many musicians that fill these pages. Stick with him, though, because the insights into some of the most important records of the last 30 years are illuminating.He’s apologetic, but still a little bewildered at the furore over the Prodigy’s Smack My Bitch Up, in which producer Liam Howlett lifted an Ultramagnetic MCs sample that appeared to condone violence towards women. One infamous XL plot twist gets a remix. It turns out that Russell’s young children were ill – impetigo, teething – when Operation Trident warned XL off releasing records by Giggs, a threat Russell shrugs off as less important than the squalling at home. He is happiest recollecting the spiritual connections he made with Scott-Heron and Womack the coincidences and “endless threads” – samples, influences – that make up his life’s work.A number of deaths stalk this book: Scott-Heron’s, Womack’s and the Prodigy’s Keith Flint in the epilogue. And whatever Russell’s nature prior to 2013, when he contracted the life-threatening neurological condition Guillain-Barré syndrome, his writing is imbued with a survivor’s intensity. Russell has done, as they say, work on himself he contextualises his own previous actions in the light of who he is now – restored to health, less full-on, and happy to leave the day-to-day of XL to trusted consiglieri while he pursues his own music. His second album, Everything Is Recorded, is scheduled to coincide with the book.The final chapters about Russell’s illness are actually riveting, taking in myelin sheaths, bleeding penises and Damon Albarn’s gift of soup. By the end, a Buddhist monk is teasing Russell about his reluctance to call himself a Buddhist, despite Russell falling quite hard for The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Russell reasons that he didn’t intend to exchange one organised religious ecosystem – his parent’s Judaism – for another. The monk counters that Russell’s sounds like “a spiritual ego-system”. If anything, this book is a refreshing account of how a tremendously successful record aficionado gradually worked his way round to a kind of Zen humility.• Liberation Through Hearing: Rap, Rave and the Rise of XL Recordings by Richard Russell is published by White Rabbit (£20).

Ideas such as universal basic income suggest Covid-19 could do likewiseRishi Sunak says the measures he has announced to support the economy are without precedent in peacetime, and he’s right. Never before has the British state agreed to pay the wages of those at risk of losing their jobs. Never before has the government ordered the pubs to shut.The chancellor is not the only one to see the struggle against the coronavirus pandemic as akin to a military operation. Boris Johnson sees this as the summer of 1940, with himself as Churchill.Harking back to the second world war is inevitable given how strongly influenced Britain is by an event that ended 75 years ago, but there are some key differences.The main one is that between 1939 and 1945 the economy was running at full tilt. It took the fight against Hitler to finally eradicate the high unemployment of the 1920s and 1930s. Britain had full employment and would have had rising inflation had it not been for rationing and price controls.Instead of production being scaled up, it is being scaled back. There are a few sectors where activity is rising – food production and healthcare – but those increases will be dwarfed by the lost output elsewhere. Around a third of workers in the UK have jobs in the sectors most affected by the pandemic: retail, restaurants, bars, clubs, hotels, cinemas, theatres, gyms, sport – and they are all closed for business, possibly for months to come. This is not 1940, with factories working round the clock. It’s more like a neutron-bomb attack that targets the people but leaves the buildings unscathed.Nor, unlike 1940, is it just a question of holding on until the Americans get involved. The US was never at threat of being invaded and was able to put its enormous economy on a war footing.But the US is not immune from the coronavirus. On the contrary, it is going to suffer grievously. This is in part because Donald Trump was in denial about the risks, in part because the public healthcare system is so poor, and in part because the social safety net is so weak. Given its size and place at the heart of the global financial system, the US will still have a vital role to play in any recovery, but the number of jobs lost as large parts of the economy go into hibernation is going to be colossal. The country is currently where it was in 1930, when the dole queues were lengthening after the Wall Street crash, rather than in its much more robust state a decade later.Those seeking parallels with the second world war need to broaden their perspective. One way of looking at today’s events is to see the 15 years before the financial crisis of 2007-08 as the equivalent of the years leading up to the first world war. Although this seemed a peaceful, prosperous period – the so-called long Edwardian summer – things were not quite as benign as they seemed. The global balance of power was changing, and there was political unrest and growing class conflict. The first few years of the 21st century, marked by debt-fuelled growth and financial market anarchy were just as delusional.The financial crisis shattered the mood of complacency just as the outbreak of war did in 1914. Winning the struggle in both cases proved harder than expected, and in both cases there was an attempt once victory had been declared to go back to business as usual: balanced budgets and a return to the gold standard in the 1920s balanced budgets, debt-driven growth and financial speculation in the 2010s.But turning the clock back proved impossible. Political discontent and anger grew as economies struggled. Trust in the democratic process frayed. There was little international cooperation.Then, around a decade and a half later in both cases, there was a second shock: the collapse of the financial bubble in 1929 the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. If history is any guide, it is the second shock that makes fundamental change possible.Four big things happened in the 1930s and 1940s. First, the old economics was abandoned. Countries came off the gold standard and states began to pump-prime growth, albeit timidly in most cases. Maynard Keynes’s general theory inspired an entire generation of economists and policymakers.Second, there was an attempt to inject equity into economies through enhanced power for trade unions, more progressive taxation and the expansion of welfare states.Third, work began early on this progressive agenda. In Britain, the Beveridge report, the Butler education act and the white paper on employment all emerged while the second world war was still raging.Finally, there were attempts to build a new international architecture through the creation of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which was intended to avoid the policy fragmentation of the 1930s.How close are we to a repeat of all this? Just consider, a model that has failed not once but twice has been ditched. Governments recognise they have to support their citizens through this. New ideas such as universal basic income are being championed, and without multilateral cooperation there will be no victory against Covid-19. Sunak is right. This is different, perhaps more fundamentally so than he thinks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d6562eb5431c0c91fd76d74ce92e3e91064a24f/2_0_1102_661/master/1102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1ad8f9f3aa041dea955c74ff5a02b41","title":"the country is being run by a marketing manager who cant get the message out dont go out","story":"Like you I am very concerned about this coronavirus "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7d338b833f69f92469265040c03d92df05d4d29/0_131_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9806a66d9e759db8ff14c360efc5db16","title":"childish gambino 31520 album review","story":"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levityIn hindsight, music has always been Donald Glover’s true calling. Before the sitcoms, the Star Wars movie, the Saturday Night Live hosting gigs, and the well-worn gifs of the performer walking horrified into a burning room with a stack of pizza boxes, you could find him on YouTube as a member of Derrick Comedy. The group’s greatest sketch, B-Boy Stance, saw Glover play an ageing hip-hop pioneer who had his arms surgically attached to his back, ensuring he was forever pulling the iconic pose – it riffs on the distance between the New York acolytes who witnessed the birth of hip-hop and those who came to the music after it was commodified. Glover’s understanding of American culture shines with diamond clarity Atlanta, his comedy-drama that goes deep into the city’s rap scene, is the evolution of those ideas.Glover’s early forays into rap were corny and forgettable. The Childish Gambino project felt like the side hustle of a talented kid eager to test every limit of his creativity – that the moniker was taken from an online Wu-Tang Clan name generator seemed to reflect how low it fell on his list of priorities. In 2016, the funk record Awaken, My Love! was an artistic breakthrough. Then came 2017’s vicious This Is America and a video that encapsulates the racial prejudice, police brutality and vicious gun lust freezing the soul of the self-proclaimed greatest country in the world. The clip became a pop cultural juggernaut, anointing Glover as spokesman for the Black Lives Matter generation.3.15.20 is the glorious payoff of this musical evolution. Melding elements of industrial hip-hop, hard-edged funk and pulsing electronica, with occasional experimental breakdowns a la Pink Floyd, it is an ambitious album that can turn from hedonism to hope on a dime. And with its genre-hopping ethos, bold orchestral choices and pleasing tunefulness, it is the first truly boundary-pushing record of the 2020s, cementing its creator as a daring virtuoso. (The roll out of the record wasn’t quite as well executed: songs temporarily began streaming on a continuous loop last Sunday via donaldgloverpresents – and are once again – leaving fans to ponder whether it was a leak or part of an elaborate release strategy.)No song is quite as blunt as the societal sledgehammer that was This Is America because they don’t have to be – Glover’s sharp pen and outlandish concepts see him smartly examine topics such as freedom in the digital age, the nature of reality and the malignancy in the soul of his home nation.Take Algorhythm, which warns of the erosion of personal liberties as the algorithms that serve our information alter our minds. The corrosive psychological effect of phones has become catnip for songwriters in recent years but Glover brings his own perspective, using vocal effects to slide into the role of artificial intelligence while dropping biblical references. Elsewhere, he buries his voice so deep in effects at moments that it is near-impossible to make out his words – see 32.22, a bruising rap song that shares DNA with Kanye West’s Black Skinhead. The effect alludes to the disappearance of his soul into a digital vortex, inviting listeners to determine what is and is not real.The most direct probing comes on the Ariana Grande-assisted Time, as Glover – sounding half flower child, half crystal gazer – questions whether the world is “exactly what it seems”. With a melody reminiscent of forgotten single Cry, there’s even a touch of Michael Jackson to the sweeping anthem. It’s not difficult to picture MJ, arms stretched out in a Christ-like stance, singing lines such as: “Seven billion people trying to free themselves  Said a billion prayers trying to save myself.” Not that you ever would have caught Jackson over these psych-tinted guitar strums and eccentric, retro-futuristic drum machines.The gentle funk of 47.48 evokes memories of Stevie Wonder as Glover explores the devastating effect violence has on childhood innocence. There are moments of levity, though. On the Prince-esque lover-man jam 24.19, the meaning of a relationship is captured through minutiae as Glover smiles at his sweetheart’s appreciation of fairytales, the way they wear their hair and the chicken dinners the couple once shared. More passion comes on 12.38, throwback funk featuring horny one-liners such as “Hit the uchi-chuchi ti’ll it’s slanted” the hazy pop of Feels Like Summer will line up well on barbecue playlists.These are lighter moments in a grander work that instantly feels part of the zeitgeist. It’s especially appropriate, then, that 3.15.20 has dropped into the feeds of people social distancing. The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak – what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting – 3.15.20 captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d4307cd131b6e786e2e196d91f08b87e9810fb8/0_51_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a39885b306e9034a40ba5ba8ccbda25","title":"schools tell employers dont put profit over people with key worker lists","story":"Coronavirus efforts could fail if too many children stay in school, say education leadersEducation leaders have told companies not to put profit over people, claiming attempts to stop the spread of coronavirus could fail if too many parents try to keep their children in school.Only children of key workers – including medics, police and food distribution staff – are eligible for places from Monday.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, urged parents to “only leave your child at school if you have no other choice”.“My appeal to the families of key workers is: this is not business as usual. Keep your family at home if at all possible. Leave the few spaces available for those that truly have no alternative.“My appeal to companies and other employers: please do not interpret the key workers lists liberally for your own ends. Do not put profit over people.”Government guidance, issued on Friday, listed the relevant occupations and children with “at least one parent or carer” who is considered critical to the Covid-19 response “can attend school if required”.The National Education Union criticised the Department for Education’s guidance as not being clear enough and called for an urgent clarification, saying a strong message was needed to let parents know their child should only be at school if there was no alternative. Dr Mary Bousted, the NEU’s joint general secretary, said teachers were on the frontline. “They can only do this vital work if everyone plays fair,” she said.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said: “Tomorrow, all schools will be closed except for vulnerable children and those of critical workers. If your work is not critical in the response to coronavirus then please keep your child at home. This will help to halt the spread of the virus, protect the NHS and save lives.“We will be closely monitoring what is happening in schools and will ensure they get the support they need in the weeks and months ahead.”The erging approaches to school closures may stem from the considerable uncertainty around the extent to which children are playing a role in spreading Covid-19.“It seems most plausible to me that they are being infected but are at low risk of developing disease,” said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We know that for flu, children are important transmitters of infection, which is the basis for the flu vaccination programme directed at children, but we do not know yet how important they are as transmitters of coronavirus. So closing schools would be based on the assumption that they do make an important contribution to transmission.”Rates of various illnesses are seen to rise and fall at the start and end of school terms. School holidays were thought to have led to a plateau in the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Also advised hygiene and social distancing measures, such as hand washing and reduced physical contact, just aren’t very effective in a primary school playground setting. So there is the potential for schools to act as a local fountain of infection for the surrounding area.“Every mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they’re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats,” said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.This uncertain science has to be carefully weighed against the certain disruption and cost of school closures, including taking large numbers of doctors and nurses out of the workplace, and unintended consequences such as grandparents, who are among the most vulnerable, taking on childcare and facing greater exposure.One primary school head said it was vital numbers of children be kept low to allow social distancing. Chris Dyson, the head of Parklands primary school in Seacroft, Leeds, which has 360 pupils, has split his staff into three rotas, allowing 14-day breaks away from the classroom to allow self-isolation.Jules White, the head of Tanbridge House School in Horsham, West Sussex, a secondary school with 1,600 pupils, was expecting between 90 and 100 pupils.From his informal network of school leaders and teachers, as coordinator of the WorthLess? lobbying campaign over school funding, White said it was clear “schools are really busting a gut”.Simon Kidwell, the head of Hartford Manor primary school in Cheshire, and who sits on the NAHT national executive, said since the key workers list came out he had been plugging the message to parents”: “Is your job corona critical?”He said: “First I briefed all the parents in the playground. I told them what our stance was. I used language like ‘last resort’ and ‘your family are safer’ if the social distancing is in their own home, rather than coming into our child care. We’ve had our phones on between 10am and 3pm over the weekend.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said staffing would be lower because more will have to self-isolate or will become ill over the weekend. Parents would need to be prepared that not every child will get a place.“We would appeal to parents who consider themselves to be on the key worker list only to send their child to school if there is no alternative and to treat this emergency provision as a last resort.“We would ask them to understand that it may not necessarily be possible to provide a place for every child and that schools may have to prioritise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/614f6f3c74ecba810de73496f842b6afa05f18ae/0_207_6252_3754/master/6252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f58bdddb227f9c5d502734fc1d4207f9","title":"let your kids get bored emergency advice from teachers on schooling at home","story":"Suddenly the children are at home. How do you even start to educate them yourself? Here are some expert tips from their teachersSchool may have closed for the foreseeable future, and all exams cancelled, but children still need to be educated and entertained – as well as reassured. Many schools plan to send work home and there are lots of free resources available via online platforms such as BBC Teach. But meanwhile, how do you even start home learning when this is all so new? We asked teachers for their emergency advice.“Great learning only happens when children feel happy, safe and secure. Provide your children with reassurance and love.” Jules White, headteacher at Tanbridge House school, Horsham“Children need normality, familiarity and structure. So keep to a routine. It makes home schooling easier and helps children to realise this is not a holiday, and that teachers are expecting learning to take place to some degree.” Lillie Rosenblatt, teacher at Brookfield primary school in Camden, London“Let your child create their own structure or timetable for the day, combining their ideas and home learning. If they try and schedule double PlayStation every morning, then it’s probably time for parents to step in, but give them the option first. I think a lot of parents will be impressed with the outcome.” Joanna Conway, headteacher, Whitegate End primary school and nursery, Oldham“In communities like mine, there are not a lot of PCs, laptops and other tech in the home that allow pupils to access learning platforms. My advice is let your kids have a holiday and enjoy themselves until they get bored. Then they will want to get on to learning they have been set. The homework is there not to improve standards but to ease boredom.” Chris Dyson, headteacher, Parklands primary school, Leeds“It will be important for friends to stay in virtual contact with each other as long as interactions are friendly and supportive – but avoid an unhealthy overreliance on screen time in all of its guises. Too much screen time has very negative effects on physical and mental health and it disrupts sleep patterns as well. Variety is key: exercise, reading a great book and learning a new skill are all suitable ways of avoiding the sheer monotony of a TV and computer screen.” Jules White“Continue to practise essential English and maths. Review fundamental maths skills such as number bonds, times tables, ision facts and additionsubtraction strategies. Encourage your child to write for pleasure about what they’ve done that day, or make a comic.” Jordan Bickel, Grand Avenue primary and nursery school, Surbiton“Children need to have a plan or timetable right from the start, and to stick to it using a timer. But activities should not just be solely English and maths-based. Making learning fun is vital – so baking, painting and getting out and about in the garden are essential to reduce boredom.” Emily Proffitt, headteacher, Tittensor first school, Stoke-on-Trent“Listen to your child. Enjoy hearing your child explain what they are being asked to do, and the challenges they face.” Jules White“It’s vital that children get downtime to be independent and relax. We are encouraging our pupils to write to each other, giving them a purpose but also helping them feel less isolated.” Emily Proffitt“Whether it’s reading to themselves, a parent, a sibling or even a special animal friend, it’s essential children continue to read. Reading anything counts.” Jordan Bickel “The younger the child, the less time they can sit and learn for, so frequent breaks are important for productivity.” Lillie Rosenblatt“I’d recommend around two hours’ learning in total a day for children in key stage 1, which covers reception to year 2. That should include arts and crafts, and hands-on activities. Children in key stage 2, which covers year 3 through to year 6, would be able to do more: about three to four hours. But again, that should include PE activities and more creative tasks as well.” Jordan Bickel“Encourage your child to research something that is of interest to them and show their learning with a creative project. This could be making something with play-dough, junk modelling, papier-mache or a presentation. Let your children experiment.” Jordan BickelMovement breaks – such as dancing to music, performing animal walks or playing Simon Says – provide children with sensory feedback and offer them a chance to “reset”. “If fast movement breaks aren’t working, slow it down by doing wall or chair push-ups or squeezing hands, shoulders or legs. Find what works for your child. It will really help with learning and focus.” Lillie Rosenblatt“There are so many benefits to outdoor learning: children develop an appreciation of the world around them, enhance their solving skills and increase their sensory skills, not forgetting the benefits for physical and mental health. Maybe you could learn about all the plants and trees near your house, or create your own outdoor circuit and do a daily workout together. Doing something physical keeps our mind healthy too.” Joanna Conway“Positive constructive praise that targets effort, behaviour and specific aspects of a child’s work is much more powerful than just saying ‘well done for completing your English’. Lillie Rosenblatt“Enjoy the extra time together. Create some artwork, a board game, make a meal together, do a jigsaw, write a song or put on a production, a dance or make a video. Maybe you could send it to relatives to cheer them up. I would also recommend sharing a ‘family gratitude’ each day.” Joanna Conway“Try to keep to your timetable as much as you can. It will really help you to vary what you study at home and your teachers are more likely to be online at those points in the day to help you specifically.” Niamh Sweeney, teacher, Long Road sixth-form college, Cambridge“Search the web for free resources for your subject. There are numerous websites now offering premium content for free during the crisis.” Alex Goldsmith, maths teacher, the Alleyne’s academy, Stevenage“Keep a journal. Each day, spend six minutes writing about the following: three things you are grateful for, how you plan to make today great, a good deed you will do that day, how you plan to improve yourself and, at the end of it, some great things you experienced that day.” Chris Hirst, Stretford high school, Manchester“Try not to worry about the situation. As soon as schools and colleges know what is happening about college and university applications, we will let you know. Take a break from social media – and don’t forget to wash your hands.” Niamh Sweeney“Read a book you haven’t read before. Take a photography challenge: document your time in isolation in photographs (your mood, what you did, how you felt). Calculate the value of Pi to as many decimal points as you can. Learn a dance step or a magic trick from the internet. Make a meal from whatever you have in the cupboards – extra marks for putting together a totally original, mad or weird recipe.

It was genuinely a great European night, at a ground and club whose very essence is celebrating great European nights, stretching back decades to Bill Shankly’s great rebuilding. That night, before Boris Johnson’s government finally decided “mass gatherings” were no longer so safe in the Covid-19 pandemic, dazzled visitors were as ever taking selfies by the statue of Shankly, with its winning inscription: “He made the people happy.”Whether it was quite such a privilege to be there in health terms is a question a growing number of Liverpool supporters have been asking. If an inquiry is held in future into the government’s handling of this crisis, it must surely ask how a mega-event, bringing 54,000 people into the old atmospheric streets, pubs, bars, shops, chippies and stadium, with 3,000 from Madrid, was allowed to go ahead at that time.On the same day, the World Health Organisation classified Covid-19 as a pandemic. The WHO’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urged more action, with testing for the virus at the fore, saying: “We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.”Vallance explained that while the “vast majority” of people would suffer only a mild illness and herd immunity could thereby be built, “at the same time we protect those who are most vulnerable”.It was difficult to understand then how the vulnerable – older citizens, people with existing health issues including diabetes, heart and respiratory problems – were being protected. The only government advice was that people who believed they may have symptoms should self-isolate.Schools were not planned to close, football matches were being played. The lack of restrictions was a concern to the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who described the approach as an “outlier” compared to other countries.On the week of the match, Madrid had become the centre for the spread of the coronavirus in Spain, with 782 of 1,646 confirmed cases. Spain closed its schools on Tuesday 10 March, the day before the match. On the same day, following health advice, La Liga announced that all matches would be played behind closed doors.So, as Merseyside MPs Dan Carden and Ian Byrne observed, and Maria Eagle, who challenged the health minister Matt Hancock about it in parliament even as Anfield was belting out You’ll Never Walk Alone, 3,000 Atlético fans travelled to watch their team in Liverpool, when their own stadium was closed to prevent the spread of the virus.Alarm about the British government’s approach was sounded loudly for the first time on the night of the match, by Prof John Ashton, the former regional director of public health for north-west England. Appearing on Newsnight, he described the strategy as “pathetic”, arguing it was failing to protect vulnerable people.When asked whether the Liverpool match should have been held, he said he is an Anfield season ticket holder himself but had decided not to go to that most alluring of games.Ashton is very well known to Liverpool supporters, considered a hero for his actions at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 when the crush in the Leppings Lane “pens” killed 96 people.Ashton was there as a fan, and he reacted by trying as a doctor to help organise a rescue operation. Ashton was trenchantly critical then too, outspokenly describing the South Yorkshire police response as “woefully inadequate”, a view fully vindicated at the inquests in 2014-16.Ashton is still not holding back about the government’s response to Covid-19. He argues it should have followed Ghebreyesus’s plea for widespread testing, to try to identify carriers and isolate them, as South Korea is recognised to have done successfully. “Herd immunity” was a flawed strategy, he argues, which was indeed resigned to millions of people becoming infected, with huge numbers dying and catastrophic consequences for the NHS.“I think it was clinical and policy negligence,” Ashton argues. He decided not to go to the game when he heard the Madrid fans were going. “It is very likely that some people were carrying Covid-19 and there could be an outbreak because of it.”Dan Wakefield, 33, a Liverpool supporter and graduate of Liverpool university’s football industries MBA, was at the game. He has a disability, spinal muscular atrophy, which means he uses a wheelchair and it also affects his breathing. “It leaves me particularly vulnerable to this virus,” he says. He was alarmed at the “herd immunity” idea, and distressed by hearing media reports when people died that they had underlying health problems.“I thought it was appalling that those Madrid supporters were allowed to come to the city, mingle in the pubs, restaurants, hotels and on public transport, potentially transmitting the virus to lots of people when their own city was becoming a major European hotspot.“This elevated the risk unnecessarily within Liverpool and was grossly irresponsible.” He is fearful for his safety and that of his sister, a nurse, and mother, 68, who cares for him.Joe Blott, chair of Liverpool’s Spirit of Shankly supporters trust, said he did ask the club about the policy of continuing to host matches even before the previous home game, against Bournemouth. Liverpool, like all other British football clubs, were following government advice, which was still that mass sporting events were low risk.Games were still scheduled to go ahead on the following weekend, until the Premier League and EFL decided themselves to postpone matches, now until 30 April at the earliest. That was after the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, tested positive on 12 March, the day after the Liverpool game, and clubs suddenly realised they could not guarantee the health of their own players and staff.Hancock said, as all ministers have, they were “following scientific advice”, suggesting that suspending the match would not have “the biggest impact”. A spokesperson for the department of health and social care defended the policy, and the government’s timing of measures, which changed five days later to advise “social distancing”.Last week, universities and schools closed, followed by pubs, restaurants, gyms, cinemas, theatres and museums a nation was sent home. As all these normalities fell away, it came to seem like another era, not merely days earlier, when it had still somehow been fine for 54,000 people to pack in at Anfield, having the time of their lives all over Liverpool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b1bb9cc7441400a1521055234c05a56ce7570b7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=986794c5f597c1c567935eebfd27ef87","title":"there is no greater pleasure than eating with my family what makes you smile","story":"For some, it’s remembering when they first met their partner, while for others it’s their dog that causes them to beam, says Kate Leahy. What’s the secret to making you grin?From a big beam to the littlest lift at the corners of your mouth, smiling is infectious in the best possible way. Which is happy news, as new research shows smiling can really improve our mood, spurring a chemical reaction in our brains. As adults, we smile 20-40 times a day – finding joy in small moments that matter is as important as taking care of your teeth and gums. Here, six people share what makes them smile.Hazel Gardiner, 41, floral artist“My dog, Ringo, has made me smile from the moment we met. He was the puppy in a lively litter of goldendoodles who came straight over, desperate to be near me. Ringo is really loving but has some funny quirks. He’s not scared of lightning, but if he sees a luggage trolley he freaks out. He’s also a ball stealer at the park. He can hold three in his mouth, so you need an extra ball to get him to drop them. There have been times when I’ve walked him in the morning and been late for work because he won’t drop someone else’s ball. Now, we take five with us just in case. If I’m working on my laptop, Ringo will nudge my hand with his nose for a cuddle. I’m smiling just thinking about him. I’ve made it my mission to look after my teeth and, as a result, I’m a big smiler.”Sukhi Wahiwala, 45, small business coach“In the Sikh faith we believe that, at a certain point, the roles reverse and children look after their parents. Sadly, a year ago, my mother passed away. Helping my father deal with the loss after 65 years of marriage has been challenging, but positive too. My four children call him Papaji. Because we’re so close, each one of us has been able to be a part of my mum for him. I’m my father’s sounding board. I love listening to stories from his youth. We often talk about my mum’s encyclopedic knowledge and we laugh when I prompt him in the same way she would, bringing his memory back to life.”Nick Gaskell, 35, mortgage adviser“I’ve always struggled with my teeth. I have weak gums from lack of brushing as a child, and my two front teeth cross over. Now I pay serious attention to cleaning my teeth thoroughly and I smile with more confidence. And it shows when I’m doing what I love – gardening. My girlfriend and I recently bought a flat in a mansion block in north London, complete with an overgrown garden. Suddenly, I’m that person who watches gardening tutorials on YouTube, invests in fairy lights and visits the garden centre at the weekend. Now I look out of my kitchen window and see lavender, pieris and my favourite blue hydrangea. There’s a huge sense of achievement.”Christine Brown, 59, housing officer“My oldest daughter had lots of allergies as a child, so I’ve always made everything from scratch since then. Food is a big part of our family life. I find cooking very therapeutic, but there is no greater pleasure in the world than sitting down to eat with my family and seeing their faces light up.”Mariatu Turay-Akar, 42, owner of fashion brand Gitas Portal“I feel so fortunate that my marriage is still, after 20 years and five children, full of love and constant laughter. We’re playful together he makes me feel young. I often forget I’m in my 40s. Remembering when we met brings me joy – though, actually, I wasn’t interested at first. I assumed that we wouldn’t have much in common, but he turned out to be the most witty, charming man, and loves the theatre – just like I do. I smile most when I’m around him.”Keri Tebbit, 32, course development manager“When my four-year-old daughter first saw my braces, she said: ‘Wow!’ like they were the coolest thing ever.

You might wash your hands after you’ve been out but then contaminate them straight away with your phone, as you haven’t cleaned it.You can also just use soap and water. Clearly don’t put your phone under running water, even if it’s water-resistant. Moisten a cloth or a paper towel with washing-up liquid or hand soap – something that foams, with a detergent in it.

From staying busy to preparing a ‘nest’, here is a guide to help you drift offWinding down without screens has always been key to getting a good night’s sleep – and it is more important than ever, says the sleep consultant Maryanne Taylor. More of an issue than the stimulating effects of blue light is the sense of being overwhelmed by the news. It is important to keep up with the coverage “within reason”, says Taylor however, “for sleep, that means evenings without it”. Reading the news before bed may cause a spike in adrenaline that will impede sleep.If you do watch TV in the evenings, the sleep coach Katie Fischer suggests comedy shows as “a helpful distraction from anxious thoughts”. Taylor suggests spending some time (although not right before bed) writing by hand to clear your mind: “Thoughts, anxieties, worries – get it down on paper.” Studies have shown a link between the practice of writing, seeing your concerns written down before you, and reducing the mental toll of your worries. If you struggle to get to sleep, or often wake up in the night, don’t lie there for long: it builds an association between your bed and wakefulness. Taylor suggests having a “nest” set up in another room with a book, a podcast or restful music (no TV or phones), to retreat to if sleep doesn’t come. “When you start to feel a bit more drowsy, take yourself off to bed.”Fischer says deep abdominal breathing can alleviate symptoms of anxiety – a busy mind, tensed muscles, a quickened heart rate or shallow breathing. One simple technique is “sama vritti”, or “equal breathing”. Lie on your back with one hand on the top of your belly and one hand on your heart, your shoulders heavy and your hips open and relaxed. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four to six, filling your belly, then ribcage, then upper chest, as if expanding a balloon. When your lungs are full, pause – then exhale through your nose in a long, smooth motion. Pause again when your lungs are emptied. Repeat this for five to 10 minutes or until you feel ready to sleep.Previously, Taylor says, the biggest impediment to sleep was the unrelenting stress of our daily lives. “Now we’re facing a different challenge: the possibility of excess time.” With many people working less or not at all for the foreseeable future, it won’t take long for mental health to suffer. Structuring your days with waking and wind-down routines and regular times for work, meals and exercise will help you stay focused."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b9a9716d3f29787eeb127cce24a213e7c1fb7d9/5_150_6572_3943/master/6572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=428a43323859041583aa75fc94af669d","title":"i turned off phone notifications and instantly felt calmer and happier","story":"When I was on holiday, I switched off email alerts. Then Twitter, Instagram and Facebook followed. When I got home, I decided to keep culling …‘It always happens when you least expect it.” Or so the adage goes the romantic notion that the job of your dreams or the love of your life will appear when you’re not trying. In my life, this does not ring true: every job I’ve landed I tried very hard to get, and even in the realm of love there has been work to nurture and maintain it.But when it comes to better mental calm, it did arrive when I least expected it, as an unintended consequence of a tiny tweak: turning notifications off on my phone.I discovered this life-transforming trick while on holiday in Bali. I had already muted notifications related to work (email pings, Slack, Gchat), but still found myself woken up in the middle of the night by the phone vibrating incessantly from conversations happening in the UK across WhatsApp and social media. Next, I switched off all notifications for Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. I also silenced WhatsApp, which – with all the various group chats – could easily alert me more than 100 times a day.When I got back to the UK, I saw no reason to put any of these notifications back on, be it work or social. Life was still busy and hectic, but less harsh, somehow. It was as if someone had turned the volume down on my life ever so slightly.I decided to cull even more notices. The news blasts were the first to go: I did not need to be notified hourly about a worsening pandemic that I was helpless to do anything about. Then I disabled the notifications from the dozens of fitness apps that “remind me” (read: chide me) that I have not exercised that day, which I already know. Notifications of store discounts, gone holiday deals, goodbye. One by one, as a notification popped up on an app, I got rid of it, until just a few crucial ones remained (eg my period tracking app and the one with transport updates about my commute). Rather than my phone buzzing every 20 minutes, it was once every few days.I’d love to say that doing this brought down my overall screen time that without prompting I did not look at my phone as much. I’d love to say that the evils of the blue screen – their alleged impact on our sleep and keeping us sedentary – are now banished from my life, and that instead of hungrily reading articles or watching YouTube videos of Gordon Ramsay being mean to restaurateurs, I flick through history books and go for long walks. But turning off notifications did not give me a personality transplant. My internet-centric behaviours, long programmed inside me, did not wither away.Rather, what it did was stop the feeling of shock associated with being buzzed by the world. A notification, like a telephone call out of the blue, essentially says: “Stop everything and look at me right now.” It’s disconcerting it keeps you in a state of high alert that is stressful and draining, especially when the content may require immediate action. Think of cutting alerts like a digital detox, but less smug, more sustainable and still with access to Google Maps.Stress is the common factor in many behaviours widely understood to be bad for our health – drinking too much booze, smoking cigarettes, even eating unhealthy food. (There is some evidence to suggest that cortisol – the hormone released when we feel stress – makes us crave high fat and sugary foods.) And, these days, many of life’s stressors are communicated via the mobile phone. I cannot stop these stressors, but by turning off notifications, I can at least stop them ambushing me. It’s an action that helps me regain some sense of control. For example, when I open up a news app, I am ready to find out what is happening in the world. It is different from being in the supermarket cheese aisle and getting an alert, where – as part of a whole barrage of communications – I may feel blindsided.One of the great issues of modern life is our overinflated sense of importance. We think: “What if someone needs me urgently?” However, being “needed” is quite rare – wanted, maybe – but needed as an ordinary person who is not a head of state, health worker or something similar? I’m not so sure. Has anyone even noticed I am slower to respond? Have I had a single comment about being slower to reply, from anyone? The answer is a resounding no.I should mention that this neat little tweak is not a magic bullet. The fact I also do yoga and occasionally see a therapist plays a big part in my increased mental calm. But I felt the difference of doing this instantly, and it felt significant.Turning off notifications is the life-changing tweak that I will never go back from. It’s not a trick anyone can make money from, and so perhaps most people will never hear of it – although hearing less from the world might be exactly what is needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97089100ca426c91a2b7a7471e0cd42ea1f27062/0_232_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4cb9602f0e1c6b5fd502b7ccbcf6641","title":"bbc childrens boss alice webb defends quality of programmes","story":"Streaming sites could not make same distinctive British shows, says Alice WebbThe outgoing BBC children’s director has said YouTube and Netflix could not provide the same distinctive British children’s programmes as those funded by the licence fee, as the corporation responds to the coronavirus outbreak by bringing forward the launch of a child-friendly version of iPlayer.In an interview with the , Alice Webb defended the quality of the corporation’s children’s output in the face of threats to its funding package, suggesting British parents would miss high-quality children’s shows if the broadcaster’s budget was cut.On Friday, the BBC launched a new version of its iPlayer catchup service on smart TVs. This makes it easier for parents to find child-friendly content, by clicking on a monster shaped “children” button, which kids can then safely browse. The corporation is also preparing to unveil daily educational programming to fill the gap while schools are closed due to the pandemic.Webb, who has been the children’s director for the past five years but is leaving the corporation this month, said the BBC had taken an active decision to keep much of its children’s programming off YouTube because it was not a suitable platform. “We took the choice to not be fully on YouTube because we think it’s not a platform that was designed for children. You’re too close to things you wouldn’t want your children engaging with it,” she said.Highlighting the success of the CBBC documentary strand My Life, which explores the lives of children around the world, she said: “Children love variety, they love factual programmes that help them explain what’s going on in the world. It’s about having a real variety of quality content, stuff they can kick back and laugh at. Stuff that challenges them. Stuff that makes them really think.”There had been plans to end the afternoon broadcast of long-running children’s programme Newsround and put the resources into online news coverage. This was due to the fact that many children were staying late for after-school clubs and not home when it was being shown. These plans have been put on hold as part of the mass mobilisation of BBC resources to inform the public about the risks of the coronavirus outbreak.While the CBeebies channel for very young children remains popular, the CBBC strand for older children has been affected by growing choice: “By the age of seven or eight they’re taking independence but parents are having an increasing amount of influence. Parents tell us they really value the quality of what they produce, that it’s British, that it shows other children like theirs, that it’s not wall-to-wall cartoons.”Webb also said while news outlets often covered changes to long-running children’s shows such as Blue Peter, her job was to ensure the current generation were entertained and informed by such programmes: “The reality is that my audience isn’t reading your paper. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I let it become something in aspic in a museum. My job is to keep it amazing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5edf1f50f47c824f0d55e03b3d25158bb4e126f/0_173_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdfa594cfc7cdea89039bc1594f0c68c","title":"coronavirus local papers city am regional media","story":"Playboy, the glossy magazine relic of the pre-#MeToo era as well as the occasional publisher of Margaret Atwood, among others, would seem to have little in common with City AM, the business-led freesheet for London commuters. Yet, just as the whole world is now tackling coronavirus, both titles have suddenly found themselves at the forefront of print media’s own battle against the pandemic.From this week, both titles will halt their print editions and go online only. A print industry facing structural challenges for decades as its audience and advertising revenues moved online, now faces the consequences of a brutal pandemic raging through populations and economies.For many of the least secure newspaper titles, especially local papers in the US and UK, the virus could sound the death knell after years of struggle. The question is whether the pandemic will lead to the death of print itself?The 66-year-old Playboy magazine, hurt over many years by the shift online for porn more than anything, is as far removed from local news providers as it is possible to imagine. Yet in the announcement made via an open letter on Medium, the chief executive, Ben Kohn, blamed the coronavirus pandemic for simply speeding up a decision based on underlying industry concerns. As the US started to close down last week, he wrote: “We were forced to accelerate a conversation we’ve been having internally: the question of how to transform our US print product to better suit what consumers want today.”Christian May, the City AM editor who was in self-isolation along with his heavily pregnant wife and young child last week when he had to tell staff the news, said the virus presented his business with the “two horns of a buffalo”. The announcement by the government last week advising people to work from home more or less wiped out the commuters who pick up City AM – while the companies which spend money on print advertising have effectively disappeared too. May said the company has suspended publication of a physical edition until it becomes viable to print again.One look at the largest advertisers in print media points to how potentially catastrophic coronavirus is for the industry in general. The travel and transport sector spent the most on advertising in print media (magazines as well as newspapers) in 2018, according to research by AAWARC and Enders Analysis: a category which has so far spent 2020 fighting for its life rather than advertising.While other categories from motors to cosmetics and food have shifted to different media such as TV since 2009, entertainment and leisure had kept relatively loyal to its print titles in 2018. With all non-essential socialising cancelled, few entertainment and leisure companies are likely to advertise again in the first half of this year.At the beginning of last week, Joshua Benton, who runs Harvard University’s Nieman Lab, made a “confident prediction” that 2020 would be the worst year ever for US local media, partly because of cumulative years of underinvestment and owners focused on cash flows before Covid-19.The newspaper industry shares some of the blame for its decline, which long predates Covid-19 and goes back to the point when the industry started giving away its content for free while hoping that circulation revenues could be replaced by advertising. This led to “commercial content” no longer referring to great stories that would attract loyal readers but to words paid for by businesses.Douglas McCabe, the chief executive and director of publishing at Enders Analysis, describes putting so much emphasis on how much Tesco would pay to run ads alongside journalism as “a mad model” compared with making consumers gladly pay for the content itself.The decision to give content away for free, taken in the teeth of an industrial upheaval, can be seen as a precursor to the growth in distrust of news, which was increasingly considered a commodity when Facebook et al suggested anyone with a smartphone could commit a valid act of journalism.There are signs of hope amid the dire warnings for local newspapers, however. It seems almost trite to say that the world needs good journalism more than ever now but people also urgently need verified information in the face of not only an unprecedented health emergency, but technology’s ability to spread fake news. What’s more, the social distancing measure being brought in to fight coronavirus makes localism and local news even more important, whether that’s which neighbour needs help today or how to save local institutions.On Friday, more than 60 regional press titles in the UK published identical front pages with headlines which promised common cause with their local communities. They declared: “We know that for you, having a constant feed of reliable news and information that you trust is vital, and this is our commitment to you: whatever happens, we will be there for you.”The BBC offered measures to help social cohesion amid the crisis last week, in so doing appearing like the adult in the room while the government still seemed like a teenager. But it could still do more to help local news providers, maybe helping to drive traffic to local news sites. There should be a way of making this support for local communities rather than greedy owners which have bled their local newspapers dry and are only now squealing.In the case of City AM, the freesheet launched 15 years ago, the editor is “committed” to a return to printing almost 90,000 copies once the worst of the pandemic is over, but its 60 staff members’ salaries will be halved from April.A full lockdown will put even more pressure on the two other London commuter freesheets – the  and the Evening Standard. On Friday, the Standard said it would continue to produce a print edition while demand was still strong. But the print run would be reduced to 500,000 copies and, for the first time, the Standard will be delivered directly to people’s homes across London. This, said CEO Mike Souter, was not only to protect staff but “in the context of currently lower advertising volumes, it makes good economic sense too”. Until recently 800,000 copies were printed a day.Editor George Osborne is one of 10 Standard executives coming into the office every day rather than working from home. In an editorial last Friday, the paper wrote: “In 2020, as our country and our capital faces one of the greatest crises in its history, our message to our readers is this: we will be there for you.”No one knows how long this pandemic will last or exactly how much damage it will cause. At the end of it, it is still to be hoped that some local papers at least are still here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/454fe13f965c35572be0c98569619bb0b626f2e4/0_326_5146_3088/master/5146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e44183f68d3767b45e30e7d9c722fd24","title":"can i get a refund on stamp duty which ive paid twice","story":"My wife and I have split up and I agreed to buy out her half of the flat we bought togetherQ In September 2017 my wife and I bought a flat in joint names as our permanent home and paid stamp duty.

When it comes to maths puzzles, Winkler is the connoisseur’s connoisseur. Team A and Team B are perennial football rivals. Every year they meet for a series of games. The first team to win four games gets to take home the Golden Teapot and keep it for a year.The teams are evenly matched except for a small home advantage. When playing at home, each team has a 51 per cent chance of winning. (And a 49 per cent chance of losing. No ties are allowed.)Every year, the first three games are played at the home of Team A, and the rest at the home of Team B.Which team is more likely to win the Golden Teapot?A math(s) professor at Dartmouth College in the US, Winkler currently occupies the chair for the public dissemination of mathematics at New York’s Museum of Math. He’s one of my all time puzzle heroes. All of his puzzles contain something special, and today’s is no exception.“I like this puzzle because there are two different approaches to solving it, which appear to lead to opposite conclusions,” he says.He adds: “Puzzles can entertain us, challenge us, and sometimes embarrass us. But the best puzzles do more: they open our eyes to an idea we hadn’t seen before. And they do this in a wonderful way, by making us come up with the idea ourselves.”I hope you solve the problem, and discover the apparent paradox for yourselves. It’s very neat!I’ll be back at 5pm with the solution, and a discussion.

While the IOC has emphatically ruled out cancelling the Olympics, it will consider a scaled down Games as well as delaying them for a few months or, more likely, a year.Only last week the IOC president, Thomas Bach, insisted that there was “No Plan B”, but it has since softened its stance amid mounting criticism by athletes amid the coronavirus crisis. The IOC will now examine several scenarios over the next month, but it is thought that deferring to the summer of 2021 is the most likely option.On Sunday evening World Athletics became the first major sport to call for the Olympics to be postponed with its president, Seb Coe, writing to Bach to tell him that Tokyo 2020 taking place as planned in July and August is “neither feasible nor desirable” amid growing international concern over the pandemic.“I write to you to request that the Games be moved,” Coe wrote, pointing out the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak meant there was no longer a level playing for athletes. He also warned there could be increased risk of athletes suffering injury and said that athletes could put their health and the health of their families at risk by continuing to train. Meanwhile the sports minister Nigel Huddleston also said he welcomed the news that the IOC was seriously considering postponing the Olympic Games. “The health and safety of athletes, sports fans and officials due to work at the Games is absolutely paramount,” he added. “We would welcome the IOC making a definitive decision soon, to bring clarity to all those involved.”Earlier, in a statement released after its executive board met on Sunday the IOC confirmed it would look at “modifying existing operational plans for the Games to go ahead on 24 July 2020, and also for changes to the start date of the Games”.The statement added: “On the one hand, there are significant improvements in Japan where the people are warmly welcoming the Olympic flame. This could strengthen the IOC’s confidence in the Japanese hosts that the IOC could, with certain safety restrictions, organise the Olympic Games in the country whilst respecting its principle of safeguarding the health of everyone involved.“On the other hand, there is a dramatic increase in cases and new outbreaks of Covid-19 in different countries on different continents. This led the executive board to the conclusion that the IOC needs to take the next step in its scenario planning.”However, the IOC stressed that any delay to the Tokyo Olympics would not be straightforward. “A number of critical venues needed for the Games could potentially not be available any more. The situations with millions of nights already booked in hotels is extremely difficult to handle, and the international sports calendar for at least 33 Olympic sports would have to be adapted. These are just a few of many, many more challenges.”Several countries have already called for the Games to be postponed, including the Brazilian Olympic Committee which cited “the notorious worsening of the Covid-19 pandemic” and “the consequent difficulty for athletes to maintain their best competitive level”.In a letter to Olympic organisations, Bach said the health of everyone involved in the Games was the most important factor. “Human lives take precedence over everything, including the staging of the Games,” he said. “The IOC wants to be part of the solution. Therefore we have made it our leading principle to safeguard the health of everyone involved.”Meanwhile UK Sport, the British Olympic Association and the British Paralympic Association have announced they will hold a conference call on Tuesday to discuss whether the Olympics should be delayed.A number of sports including athletics, swimming and boxing are in favour of postponement because of the impact coronavirus has had on their training regimes – and they are supported by the BOA.In a statement welcoming the IOC announcement the BOA chairman, Sir Hugh Robertson, urged rapid decision‑making for the sake of athletes facing significant uncertainty. “Restrictions now in place have removed the ability of athletes to compete on a level playing field and it simply does not seem appropriate to continue on the present course towards the Olympic Games in the current environment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ed092340a56753a29298cbdbde2431b45019d10/956_684_8106_4864/master/8106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=171fa9880ca8a2cfe4f947c77813bea9","title":"my favourite game manchester united v brighton 1983 fa cup final replay","story":"Back in the 1980s the FA Cup final was a huge event but my friend and I, aged 15, somehow managed to get tickets to this replayIt is hard for anyone much under 40 to grasp how important the FA Cup final used to be, how simultaneously desirable going to the Wembley showpiece was to an English football fanatic growing up in the 1970s and 80s. One of only two matches you knew would be televised live (along with England v Scotland), it overshadowed league football in a way unthinkable today.In 1983, aged 15, I travelled to watch the 1983 final at the home of a Manchester United-supporting friend who lived at the far end of the London Underground line that runs through Wembley. Neither my friend Simon nor I settled down to watch United play Brighton with any thought of what might happen next.What should have happened is that Brighton – just relegated from the top flight – should have added their name to the honoured list of small teams to shock the mighty. After a 2-2 draw, in the dying seconds of extra time, Michael Robinson teed up Gordon Smith, who had scored the first goal of the game. The moment has gone down in history to the words of Peter Jones’s Radio 2 commentary – “And Smith must score!” – but we watched it unfold in the company of John Motson: “There’s somebody to his right – it’s Smith – and Bailey saved! What an amazing opportunity for Brighton to win the Cup!”Moments later, the game finished 2-2. For the third year in a row, there would be a replay – and tickets would go on sale at Wembley the next morning. Smith’s “amazing opportunity” to win the Cup had suddenly turned into one for us to try to get to a final.Delicate telephone negotiations ensued, for permission to be out on a school night, with O levels looming. But the next morning, we caught the first train from Chesham to Wembley.The Wembley queue was daunting in length from the first. Soon it was so tightly packed that at one point I lifted up my feet to see what happened and I just carried on moving forward, albeit slowly. People had to beg the police to be let out of the queue, over the barriers, to use the toilet and be let back in. The police started to turn newcomers away, then sent some people home, a few hundred behind us in the line. But eventually we made our way up the steps, through the turnstiles, and ran to what I think were greyhound-betting booths converted into ticket offices.After a few days of bragging at school, we set out for heaven on the Thursday afternoon. We peered through the fencing and across the greyhound track as Bryan Robson gave United the lead and Norman Whiteside then became, at 18, the youngest scorer in an FA Cup final. Brighton battled, Bailey having to tip a shot over, but just before half-time Robson scored his second. Unlike the first game it was no thriller, but we were there, enthralled.A fourth goal came, to Simon’s delight, from an Arnold Muhren penalty. But the moment that sticks firmest in the memory came just before that from Steve Foster, the Brighton captain, who had failed in a high-court attempt to overturn a suspension that ruled him out of the Saturday. The section of the crowd we were in struck up a chorus to the tune of Bread of Heaven: “Stevie Foster, Stevie Foster, What a difference you have made, What a difference you have made.”He turned to us, with the ball safe, and put his left hand across his right elbow, before raising his right forearm in a universal gesture of “up yours”. As can be seen, 45 seconds into this video.I have been to Wembley well over a hundred times now and seen some great moments but few compare with simply being there that night. Gordon Smith’s FA Cup nightmare made my final dream a reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b3cb5da261fe2a6e44c9184ff9072a6d8b0951d/0_84_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90828ab9569aa4744e2743cb4d1bfdbd","title":"virtual f1 experiment race lando norris","story":"F1 driver entertains from home but race lacks the sport’s biggest names as people look to fill time with season suspendedFormula One successfully ran its first virtual GP on Sunday with the Bahrain Grand Prix won by Renault’s Chinese test driver Guanyu Zhou. The esport event created to fill the void left by the opening seven meetings of the season being called off was a qualified success. It worked, albeit with technical issues but the driver lineup was far from the representative of the real grid, with current F1 drivers decidedly thin on the ground.F1 had hoped to involve as many current drivers as possible but of the 2020 grid only McLaren’s Lando Norris, a keen gamer, and Williams’s Nicholas Latifi were racing. Latifi in his rookie season, has yet to actually compete in a real F1 race.Norris took no part in qualifying or for part of the race, apparently unable to connect to the session. Norris’s Twitch stream, as he called fellow drivers and friends while sat at home in his racing rig, was hugely entertaining, as his AI-controlled car continued to lap regardless.Try as the presenters did to talk up how the event was supposed to be just a spot of fun it was impossible not to sense that was simply a ersion from a grid that was miles away from what would have actually been in Bahrain.Alongside a range of YouTube gamers, Mercedes had former F1 and current reserve drivers Stoffel Vandoorne and Esteban Gutiérrez representing them, while Red Bull had six-time Olympic champion Sir Chris Hoy in one of their seats. Renault had golfer Ian Poulter, taking part from his home in Florida. Liam Payne, the former member of boy band One Direction, was also on track as well as Lewis Hamilton’s brother, Nicolas, who is competing in the British Touring Car Championship this year.The race itself was an entertaining, knockabout affair, opening with a short qualifying session, in which Austrian sportscar driver Philipp Eng took pole. Aiming for the level playing field the sport’s management is hoping to achieve in real life, the game’s settings had been configured to ensure equal car performance, requiring no inidual set up and with reduced damage.As expected then there were robust exchanges but little finesse with such a disparate set of drivers. There was fun to be had but this was a far cry from the real thing. Yet with so many confined to their homes perhaps this light-hearted show would appeal beyond the sport’s traditional fanbase.The race was run on the Codemasters F1 2019 game, with the competitors taking part on PC gaming rigs remotely. It was broadcast live on Sky and for free on the F1 Twitch, Facebook and YouTube channels. Technical issues forced the expected 28 lap half-distance race, to be reduced to 14 laps.F1 will run further virtual races on each weekend of the forthcoming meetings called off thus far, Vietnam, China, Holland, Spain and Monaco."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a4bc86d453963ca70af3cec40954ce556ef3a7d/0_13_3307_1986/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a506c93939fdae286000adbdcb0aebb2","title":"talking horses racing mulls localised idea for eventual return","story":"‘We’re effectively being told, stay at home, so any solution will have to involve something very creative,’ says Nick RustBritish racing is considering the feasibility of a limited return to action at a small number of all-weather tracks with horses to be stabled and trained on site, as a possible means of getting the sport going again while some coronavirus-related restrictions remain in place. The idea was hinted at by Nick Rust, chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, during an appearance on RacingTV on Sunday.While he did not suggest that any such move was imminent, Rust said: “The UK’s people may get fed up at some point in this and government will be looking for a return to economic activity as quickly and as safely possible ... We are looking at a number of possibilities about whether we could race safely and, given the restrictions that are in place now, we’re going to have to think very creatively.“We’re effectively being told, stay at home, so any solution will have to involve something very creative, probably in a very localised area. It’s too early to suggest that that’s going to happen ... I don’t want to set any hares running but I want to assure people that we’re not sitting here waiting for 12 or 14 weeks to go by and then we’d better start thinking about how we’re going to return.”The appeal of an all-weather track, in the context of a limited resumption, is that it could be relied on to stage perhaps three racedays a week, which could not be taken for granted at a turf track. If Southwell were chosen, for example, it could take 110 horses in its stables and benefit from another 35 potential runners at Scott Dixon’s base within walking distance. That would avoid the need for runners to be driven long distances to the track from training centres around the country and so there would be no breach of the government’s advice against unnecessary travel.Dixon has made arrangements to keep his stable functioning and his horses cared for during the crisis. “We’ve got six staff living on the site now,” the trainer said on Sunday, “and strict procedures are in place, trying to keep everyone healthy. We’re doing a group shop for everybody to reduce the need for anyone to go out and obviously we keep doling out the hand sanitiser.”Meanwhile, Saturday’s Dubai World Cup has become the latest sporting event to be lost due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers having accepted on Sunday that the sensationally valuable night’s racing could not be staged. The event, with a total prize fund of around £30m, had been due to be held behind closed doors at Meydan and was scheduled to be part of a packed 11-race broadcast on ITV4.Only one day earlier, officials were insisting World Cup night would go ahead, despite other sporting fixtures in the UAE having been suspended on Thursday. But a statement was issued at lunchtime on Sunday, saying: “To safeguard the health of all participants, the higher organising committee of the Dubai World Cup 2020 has decided to postpone 25th edition of the global tournament to next year.”Benbatl, a winner at Newmarket last autumn, had been the 2-1 favourite for the World Cup, in which he was expected to clash with the US-based Pegasus World Cup winner, Mucho Gusto. Those lined up for other valuable races on the card included the Melbourne Cup winner, Cross Counter. Most of the visiting runners were reported to have arrived in Dubai by the end of last week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee934d50c4e83817f85c117d53f037eb6148653c/0_412_6172_3703/master/6172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d3881614287a75cb377930c64a5c7da","title":"tokyo 2020 olympics in doubt as canada becomes first team to pull out over coronavirus","story":"Canada takes action to protect public health as Australia tells its athletes to prepare for Games in 2021Canada has become the first country to warn that it won’t send its athletes to the Tokyo Olympics unless they are postponed for a year, as pressure builds to delay the Games due to the coronavirus pandemic.The Canadian Olympic Committee said holding the Games as planned would threaten the health of its athletes, “their families and the broader Canadian community for athletes to continue training for these Games”.“In fact, it runs counter to the public health advice which we urge all Canadians to follow,” it said in a statement, hours after the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, conceded for the first time that postponement was now a possibility if the Games could not be held in their “complete form”.The committee added: “While we recognise the inherent complexities around a postponement, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our athletes and the world community.”The Australian Olympic committee (AOC), meanwhile, has told its athletes to prepare to compete in the Olympics in the northern-hemisphere summer of 2021.The AOC said the massive disruption caused by the outbreak would make it impossible to assemble a team in time for the Games, which are scheduled to open on 24 July.“We have athletes based overseas, training at central locations around Australia as teams and managing their own programs. With travel and other restrictions this becomes an untenable situation,” its chief executive, Matt Carroll, said in a statement on Monday.New Zealand added to pressure for a delay, saying the country would consider boycotting the Olympics if they open as scheduled.The committee’s president, Mike Stanley, published an open letter on Monday in which he wrote, “Athletes need a safe, and fair, playing field to compete and, right now, the widespread and evolving impact of Covid-19 is not allowing that to happen.” He urged the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to “finalise their decision as soon as possible, bringing clarity to our sports and athletes”.A few hours later, following the news that Japan was considering postponing the Games, Stanley told Newshub that “postponement is the only way to go”, and that New Zealand would consider a boycott if the Games went ahead as planned.Opposition to holding the event in July has risen sharply in recent days, with US Track and Field and UK Athletics among those calling for a delay because of the pandemic. Several countries, including Brazil, Norway and Slovenia, have pressed the IOC to consider postponement but have not threatened a boycott.The IOC said on Sunday that it was drawing up alternative scenarios for the Games, but was not considering calling them off. It said it would take up to a month to reach a decision, although that timeline will soon begin to look unrealistic if more national Olympic committees threaten boycotts.“These scenarios relate to modifying existing operational plans for the Games to go ahead on 24 July 2020, and also for changes to the start date of the Games,” the IOC said in a statement.“The IOC will ... start detailed discussions to complete its assessment of the rapid development of the worldwide health situation and its impact on the Olympic Games, including the scenario of postponement. The IOC is confident that it will have finalised these discussions within the next four weeks.”Abe, who until recently insisted the Olympics’ timing would not change, hinted that postponement could be an option if the coronavirus pandemic made it impossible to hold them in July with the full quota of athletes and spectators.If holding the Olympics in its complete form “becomes impossible, we may have no option but to consider postponing the Games, given the Olympics’ principle of putting the health of athletes first”, Abe told parliament on Monday.Despite the uncertainty, Japan’s Olympics minister, Seiko Hashimoto, said on Monday that the torch relay would start on Thursday as planned. Organisers have asked people not to line the route when the flame begins its journey through Japan’s 47 prefectures in Fukushima."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbdce83cc34cfccb50993b0613c170fddb787529/594_451_4031_2418/master/4031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6db5cd94ba20de042ef2f39a0ebf443","title":"microsoft surface pro 7 review the best windows 10 tablet pc computer","story":"USB-C completes top Windows 10 tablet with great screen, design and kickstand, plus latest Intel chipsThe Surface Pro 7 is an update of the excellent Surface Pro 6 with new processors and, finally, a USB-C port.That means the design of the new Surface Pro 7 hasn’t changed since the 2017 Surface Pro 5, with Microsoft taking an “if it ain’t broke” approach. It’s competitively priced at £699 and up – but you have to pay at least £125 for the keyboard if you want one – which annoyingly is not included in the standard price.Microsoft’s unique design language continues to stand out. Well-made computers with sharp-looking lines, lightly textured magnesium bodies with rounded corners and the company’s unrivalled kickstand on the back.The 12.3in screen is still crisp and beautiful, but the large bezels around the sides now look a little dated compared to the Surface Pro X, traditional laptops and mobile tablets. All versions are available in Microsoft’s platinum grey colour, while some are also available in black, which is definitely nicer.At 775g without the keyboard, the Surface Pro 7 is just shy of 150g heavier than the 12.9in Apple iPad Pro with similar dimensions. With Microsoft’s excellent 310g Signature Type Cover attached that brings the tablet to 1.085kg, which is lighter than most laptops including the 1.25kg MacBook Air and 1.265kg Surface Laptop 3.The Surface Pro 7 comes with either Intel’s 10th-generation i3, i5 or i7 processors. While the i3 will be fine for light usage, most will want the Core i5 or i7 versions, which are considerably more capable.The version tested had a Core i7, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and performed as you would expect from a high-end tablet PC or laptop. It handled general computing with no slowdown at all, even with 10 applications open with lots of tabs in Chrome and several large images open and being worked on in Affinity Photo, comparing favourably to Apple’s 13in MacBook Pro and Dell’s XPS 13.But the fans were considerably more noticeable than the same Core i7 version of last year’s Surface Pro 6, meaning that the Surface Pro 7 likely runs hotter. With light computing they were not audible, but when connected to a 4K monitor or when running slightly more intensive applications they were noticeable in quiet rooms. The tablet never became overly hot to the touch.Battery life was slightly disappointing, with the Core i7 version lasting around seven hours between charges, which wasn’t quite long enough to complete some work days without reaching for the charger. The Core i5 version should have longer battery life.Unlike the recent Surface Pro X and Surface Laptop 3, the Surface Pro 7 is difficult to fix and was only awarded a score of one out of 10 by repair specialists iFixit.None of the components, including the battery are user replaceable, except for the detachable keyboard, and repairs must be performed by authorised service providers.The big new change for the Surface Pro 7 is the introduction of USB-C, finally. The modern, industry-standard port is a jack of all trades and replaces the miniDisplay Port of older Surfaces devices. USB-C allows you to charge the Surface, connect any number of accessories including displays, drives, ethernet adapters and so on. You can also connect it to a USB-C dock for power, displays and accessories all from one cable.It is not Thunderbolt 3-compatible, but most will be fine with the standard bandwidth and functions of USB-C, it’s just a shame there’s only one of them.A standard USB-A port takes care of older accessories, while the Surface Connect takes the included power adapter but can also be used to connect to a Surface Dock and other Microsoft accessories. A microSD card slot is also very welcome, particularly for photographers.All versions are available in platinum with some available in black.The Surface Pro 7 is arguably the best windows tablet money can buy, it’s just not that big a leap over the Surface Pro 6.The form, design, microSD card slot, kickstand, Windows Hello and simply the way it works are still winners in 2020. The screen is still great, however the bezels around it are functional but look a little dated compared to the Surface Pro X.The big new thing is the addition of a USB-C port, which is well overdue. It’s a shame it’s not a full Thunderbolt 3 port, but I suspect most won’t care. The battery life on the Core i7 version is not class-leading, so buy the Core i5 version if you want more like a day’s work without the charger.The biggest downside is that the essential keyboard is not included with the tablet, which pushes the price up by at least £125.The Surface Pro 7 is what last year’s Surface Pro 6 should have been. It’s not cheap, but the Surface Pro 7 is best Windows tablet you can buy.Pros: great screen, good battery life, brilliant keyboard (essential additional purchase), microSD card reader, excellent kickstand, Windows Hello, solid build, easy to carry, USB-A and USB-CCons: no Thunderbolt 3, fairly expensive, keyboard should be included, Core i7 version fans are more audible This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Via the sculptures of Ron Mueck and the innovations of Jurassic Park, we arrive in the age of the curated self. But can we trust what we see? Phil HarrisonThe west London-set reality-hit-turned-finishing school for affluent young people living a gilded existence returns for a 19th series. This time, Binky and Ollie turn up (the latter with a fiancee) and Zara and Sam’s relationship continues to hang in the balance. Hannah J DaviesJulianne Moore is a 50-year-old professor with early-onset Alzheimer’s. Her efforts to navigate an increasingly strange world – supported by husband Alec Baldwin and daughter Kristen Stewart – are charted with sensitivity by writer-directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland.

As the series has evolved, we have also been increasingly focused not just on the problems people are experiencing, but the ways in which they are coming together to solve them.In the midst of the coronavirus crisis, this work has suddenly become simultaneously more difficult and more important than ever. So we’re going to try to re-imagine how the series works, and we need your help.We’re aiming at producing a weekly film, centred on how people and places are responding to the crisis, dealing with the issues we have always covered: questions about power, community, and how everyday life is actually lived.We want to build a network of local contributors and grassroots organisations, and involve our audience in guiding us and sending us footage and information about what is happening all across the country. We do not want to put anyone at risk of either catching or spreading the virus, so at the moment we are asking for people to do things only within their daily routine, and asking that they follow government social distancing advice.We’ve not lived through something like this before, so we don’t know exactly what this will look like.

After a phone consultation with her GP she was diagnosed with a chest infection and prescribed antibiotics.She began self-isolation last Monday in Manchester, where she lives, but moved to her cottage in Wales on Sunday. “I’m one of the fortunate ones,” she said. “It’s a very difficult situation for elderly people. The majority of us live productive lives and hope that society will take care of us when we are older, but we appear to have been abandoned by the health service and the government.“I’ve finished the course of antibiotics and now I just hope it goes. I’ve been putting Vicks on my chest and taking menthols. I’m quite determined.”O’Neill has been trying to support the people she works with from home. “We offer a lot of activities like horse riding, crafts, etc. Some of those won’t be possible now but we are trying to find ways to deliver other services using video.“I’ve been reading a lot and am nearly caught up with the programmes I’ve missed. At the moment I’m watching Hidden. I have three children and eight grandchildren and I’m actually trying to stop the social contact. When they all try and call it’s the end of the day before I know it.”John, who works as a bicycle courier in Manchester, decided to self-isolate on Saturday after waking up with a cough, fever and shortness of breath. “I wanted to be cautious as my job involves visiting people who might be vulnerable to coronavirus.“I messaged the supply company and they disabled my account for seven days, so I’m unable to work,” said the 24-year-old. “This wouldn’t normally be a problem but they have funds available for people who have coronavirus, but they’re not available unless you get medically tested.”As people were not getting tested for the virus unless they had been admitted to hospital John feared some people in the gig economy may not have access to the funds they need. “It makes sense as it prevents fraud but it’s a very difficult time,” he said.John said he reduces social isolation by talking to people all day on platforms such as Discord, where gaming communities can chat and share their screens while playing. “Not talking to real people can be difficult because you struggle to validate whether your thoughts are valid,” he said. “Hearing people’s voices makes you feel human and it’s a good way of trying to maintain social connections without social contact.“I live alone and one problem is that I don’t tend to remember what day it is. We’re so used to doing things that define our time off work that being at home means not having that shared experience.“I’m anticipating going back to work soon though, as people need food delivered, and there could be someone who is reliant on me.”Rosie,* who works in an office in London, has been in self-isolation for over a week. “I filled in the 111 questionnaire online and it advised me to call my GP,” she said. “I could only get through to a receptionist who advised me to go to the pharmacy, which I didn’t think was a good idea because I had a sore throat and was coughing.“I’m lucky enough to get two weeks’ sick leave from my workplace and my colleagues are supportive and understanding,” said the 37-year-old who is at home with her husband, who works in finance in IT. “My husband’s employer has been pushing for me to get tested but I can’t.”Rosie has been too unwell to do anything but rest at home. “I don’t need to think about how to pass the time as I’m actually sick. I feel tired and weak so I don’t want to do anything. Passing the time is not a big problem.”Andrew Moscrop, 42, works as a GP in Oxford, and has been in self-isolation since Friday after his temperature rose to 38.6C. “My fever resolved over the weekend,” he said. “Any other time I would go back to work as normal, but I can’t.”Moscrop contacted 111, Public Health England, the local health protection agency and the John Radcliffe hospital in the hope of being tested. “The advice was the same. Stay at home. It’s quite frustrating as at the end of the day you just want to do your job.“We are facing an escalating caseload and the government has talked of drafting in retired clinicians. Surely we should be testing frontline health workers so that, if negative, they can return to work promptly after an illness?”Moscrop’s partner, who also works in the health service, has also had to self-isolate along with their young child. “It’s become a bigger issue than we thought,” he said. “The government’s advice doesn’t seem entirely thought through as there’s nothing to say this won’t happen again later down the line.“We need to remain fairly pragmatic about it. We’re surrounded by fields so I took the little one out for a walk and a breath of fresh air. Soon I’ll have to pop out for food. I won’t wear a mask but I’ll just nip in as quickly as possible and use self-checkouts. My partner looked at getting food delivered but the available dates were quite far into the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f32d8900f9fee142a9b0a05b1fb49735150d9d/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236131e96309656f76c20ab7907f7993","title":"coronavirus the guardians promise to our readers","story":"Together we can find a way through this crisis, providing accurate and insightful reporting and listening to you, our readersThank you very much for your commitment to the .

Raccoons were spotted on the beach in an emptied San Felipe, Panama. And turkeys have made a strong showing in Oakland, California, home of one  editor.“Normally, animals live in the parts of our cities that we don’t use,” said Seth Mangle, who directs the Urban Wildlife Institute at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago. “It makes them an unseen presence, kind of like ghosts.”Gangs of wild turkeys aren’t an uncommon sight in parts of the Bay Area but it seems they’ve got a bit more room to wander through neighborhoods they might not normally visit. Boars have been known to descend upon European cities – but Barcelonans on lockdown have marveled at how the wild animals romp through quiet, deserted streets.In American cities under shelter in place orders, walks and jogs are one of the few excuses for people to go outside. “It’s going to be a really cool time to spot wildlife,” Mangle said.In San Felipe, where restaurants and bars have closed and tourist traffic is almost nonexistent, Matt Larsen has noticed some new visitors on the beach near his home. “There were three raccoons, just frolicking along right at the edge of the surf,” said Larsen, the director of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. “I’ve lived here six years, and it was something I had never seen before.”The beach, which is right by the presidential palace, is usually kept clear by security guards, said Larsen, who directs the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. “But normally there are people all around the streets are almost always crowded with foreign visitors and Panamanian tourists,” he said.Larsen, who has been teleworking from home with his wife, was happy to see “nature maintaining itself”, he said. “It was nice to see something a little out of the ordinary.”Quarantines could continue to affect wildlife in unexpected ways, said Paige Warren, an ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “I’ll be interested in whether creatures like coyotes and foxes start acting more bold in American cities,” she said. At the same time, fewer people in the streets could drive some species away, she said, especially those who subsist on whatever humans feed them – or leave behind in the trash.That is the case in Nara Park, where the sika deer – which look like Bambi – have grown accustomed to tourists lining up year-round to feed them rice crackers. Now that the park is devoid of human visitors, the deer have begun wandering into the city looking for food. They’ve been spotted crossing city streets and walking through subway stations, snacking on potted plants.In Lopburi, Thailand, the absence of tourists and their tasty snacks left local monkeys brawling over what appeared to be a cup of yogurt.But just as many urban animals have adapted to humans, they’ll find ways to adjust during the quarantine, said Warren.Mangle concurred: “As they said in Jurassic Park, life tends to find a way.” Though his team in Chicago has been working from home and practicing social distancing, Mangle said they were trying to find a way to set up equipment around Chicago for their annual study of urban wildlife and track how the coronavirus crisis may shift animal behavior.The changes will probably be subtle, the researchers said. Urban foxes and coyotes might venture out of their hiding spots a bit more. Birds might roam, graze and hunt new pastures.The narrative that wildlife populations will dramatically rebound and retake cities is fantasy – albeit one that might comfort those looking for meaning amidst the crisis. “If anything, these times may serve as a reminder that animals have always lived in our area,” Mangle said. “We may not think of our cities as a part of nature, but they are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b112a7d7299c98a6ba0cbd951cee1037fd5341cd/0_137_3996_2398/master/3996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaafbbd138b38edd35bd50c2049ecc5f","title":"coronavirus dos and donts uk advice behaving responsibly","story":"Key recommendations issued so far for social distancing and those who are self-isolatingAmid increasing demands for clarity on what constitutes social distancing and how to behave responsibly during the coronavirus outbreak, advice has been issued by the government, the NHS, and the UK’s four public health agencies.

She has been diagnosed with the virus at Addenbrooke’s hospital, but they haven’t tested her and aren’t planning to. I spend the afternoon calling the Department for Education helpline and my local health protection team to find out if I should close the school. They say carry on as normal, because you haven’t got a confirmed case.I’m sitting there thinking: this is ridiculous. I know I haven’t got a confirmed case, but that’s because they’re not testing. I send out an email to parents explaining the situation.Messages start coming through from other staff saying they’ve got coughs and other signs of coronavirus too – and staff in high-risk groups are isolating. In total, 14 staff are unable to come to work. We try to pull in supply teachers, but it’s hard to find any.I email parents again to say that we’re not sure whether we’re going to be able to open the next day but we are going to do our best.Senior leaders work until 11pm, putting together a plan of how we can keep the school open. Each time we think we have one, another staff member calls in sick.I wake up wondering how many members of staff I will lose that day. But the staff response is amazing. Part-time staff, who weren’t due to come in, offer to work. Parent volunteers and parents who are part-time teachers at other schools say they will help too. It is moving to receive so much support. But by the end of the day, we are 23 staff members down, including some of the key staff who were organising how we would stay open. I work until midnight. I am in practical mode, but I feel worried. How many days are we going to be able to keep going like this? The situation is untenable.In case the school needs to close, we decide to roll out a new online learning platform so teachers can set activities for pupils at home. We have a staff meeting, and deliver five days’ worth of training in about 40 minutes. But lots of children are not in school, so we cannot give them their log-ins.We send out another message to parents and carers warning them to start planning emergency childcare arrangements.Since the government is still saying schools will not close, we spend hours coming up with a plan of how we can stay open, with staff numbers dropping each day. In some year groups, only one teacher is left to cover three classes, with supply teachers and high-level teaching assistants trying to help. One teacher who is in that situation is newly qualified and in her first year of teaching. She works her socks off, like everyone else in the school.At 5pm, Boris Johnson announces schools will close on Friday, except for vulnerable children and those whose parents are key workers. I feel relief, but wonder why I, a headteacher, am learning this from a press conference. I think that was extremely disrespectful. Schools should have been informed earlier so we could start working on what to do.We end the day 30 staff members down.The next morning the government still hasn’t told us what the definition of a key worker is. So we are left with two days to try to put some childcare provision together for Monday, and we have no idea how many children are going to be in school and who will be eligible. This is terrible for us, and terrible for the parents who are key workers. They are all asking me: am I meant to be making arrangements or not? The uncertainty is awful.At lunchtime, we come down to the staffroom and find that our PTA has put on the table this lovely selection of food, bottles of wine and even emergency toilet rolls that staff could just help themselves to. It is a beautiful moment. Staff start crying. We are aware that it may be the last day at our school for all the children in year 6. That hits us hard. All the lovely things we normally do for the children leaving – the end-of-year play, the leavers’ assembly, the residential trip. We can’t see any of them happening now.So we give the kids elbow bumps in the playground at the end of the day and say goodbye. It is really emotional. Teachers form a real bond with the children in their class, and vice versa. To have that snipped off in such a brutal fashion is tough. We have a staff meeting to talk everything through at the end of the day, and teachers break down in tears.We decide we will provide as much outdoor learning as we can next week, and disperse the children who do come in throughout the school. I am conscious that key workers in the NHS are the people most likely to be coming into contact with coronavirus cases, and that their children are probably most likely to get infected as a result. At school, these children will all come together, and potentially infect other kids who will return home to the families of the other workers we are most dependent on.Given the way the government has been behind the curve, very reactive and flip-flopping, I haven’t got a huge amount of faith this has been well thought through. But all schools can do is make sure the children aren’t crammed up against each other where possible.When I reflect on the last week, what gives me hope is how often I’ve seen people being supportive, kind and understanding. We’re in uncharted waters but I know I’ve got the most amazing team of people around me – everyone from our office staff, teaching assistants and teachers to our parents and kids. The strength of our community has been really uplifting and heartwarming. We were already a really close knit community school, but this has brought us that much closer together.When we get our school back, when we get our lives back, we will know what’s most important to us, and I hope we will treasure and value it. Because that will be an amazing foundation for the future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c26c73c298f87841070cd41949d72dab3995636c/0_66_5023_3013/master/5023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1eb0401e4d18d4c0e33d2dde93095a5","title":"coronavirus meet the scientists who are now household names","story":"From the UK to Australia, medical experts suddenly find themselves in the Covid-19 spotlightThey are the faces of the crisis, the scientists explaining nightly to anxious audiences how the governments they advise plan to contain the coronavirus. Unknown to most a few short weeks ago, many have since become household names. But who are they?When Angela Merkel talks to the nation about Covid-19, she is usually flanked by the head of the Robert Koch Institut, Germany’s central public health institute. The country’s real face of the coronavirus crisis, however, is Christian Drosten, the head of virology at Berlin’s Charité hospital.As one of the scientists who discovered the infectious agents responsible for the Sars epidemic, Drosten has immaculate credentials. The curly haired 48-year-old also has a natural talent as a communicator that have led the Süddeutsche Zeitungmade to describe him as “the nation’s corona-explainer-in-chief”.A daily half-hour podcast in which Drosten fields questions about the virus has attracted millions of listeners since he started it with the broadcaster NDR in mid-February. On social media, there have been joking calls for him to run for chancellor and riotous fan fiction: “Touch my face, Christian Drosten.”Drosten made his Sars research public via the internet before it was published in scientific journal, and he has favoured similar levels of transparency during the current crisis.Last weekend he recommended Germans go for a walk and enjoy a good beer – although bottled beer was safer than draught, because the glass may not have been washed properly. Philip OltermannFor the second time in Spain’s recent history, all eyes are on Fernando Simón. The lanky, unassuming epidemiologist stepped into the spotlight in 2014, after a nurse in Spain contracted Ebola when a priest was repatriated to Madrid from Sierra Leone.The infection, the first outside Africa, put 15 people in quarantine and led to the monitoring of dozens more. As health officials scrambled to quell the spread of the deadly disease, Simón, who heads the country’s health emergency centre, conveyed calm.As Covid-19 began its advance around the world in February, Simón stepped up again. “You can’t imagine the satisfaction that rippled through the press room when he entered,” said a journalist with La Vanguardia who praised his clear, concise explanations.Simón has since spoken to Spaniards nearly every day. As Spain became the hardest-hit country in Europe after Italy, he has come to embody the toll the crisis is taking. Exhaustion lines on his face have deepened, his wavy hair has become ever more unruly and his rasping voice has almost given out.Spanish authorities have faced criticism for being slow to react, allowing tens of thousands to gather for International Women’s Day rallies and pack into a Madrid football stadium a week before the country went into near-total lockdown, and there have been calls for Simón to resign.“The country is in intensive care and the doctor treating it has committed too many errors,” one researcher wrote on Twitter. Others have defended Simón by highlighting the volatility of the virus and its spread. Ashifa KassamTested by Donald Trump, who demands loyalty over facts, Anthony Fauci has earned praise from the US public for telling the truth about coronavirus, even when it means contradicting the president.As a member of the White House taskforce, Fauci has been unusually frank in his frequent news appearances and briefings. A senior figure in the government’s research agency, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), he was applauded after he corrected the president about how quickly a coronavirus vaccine could be made available.Fauci, who has reported to six presidents, told Politico earlier this month: “You should never destroy your own credibility. And you don’t want to go to war with a president ... But you got to walk the fine balance of making sure you continue to tell the truth.”The Brooklyn-born doctor has been at the NIH since 1968, turning down repeated requests to lead the agency. In 1984, he was made head of its National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which researches infectious diseases such as HIVAids, tuberculosis and Ebola.Some of Fauci’s most influential work contributed to the understanding of how HIV destroys the body’s defences. In a 2019 analysis of Google Scholar citations, he was the 41st most highly cited researcher of all time.At 79, he is among those most vulnerable to developing severe coronavirus symptoms but is reportedly working 19-hour days. A dedicated runner, he told a Yahoo News reporter that he continues to run more than three miles a day. Amanda HolpuchThe coronavirus has made the precise yet avuncular figure of Jaap van Dissel, the head of the Centre for Infectious Disease Control at the National Institute for Public Health, “Dutch doctor-in-chief”, according to the NRC Handelsblad newspaper.During regular television appearances, his “calm authority lends credibility to the measures the government has adopted to slow the spread of the virus,” the paper said, naming him its man of the week last week.A professor of internal medicine and infectious diseases at Leiden university medical centre, Van Dissel, 62, has also been a member of the Dutch health council’s infectious diseases working group and vice-chair of the European Medicines Agency’s anti-infectives scientific advisory group.White-haired and bearded, he is frequently called upon to explain why the Netherlands is adopting a resolutely different approach to containing the coronavirus more comparable with the UK’s than many of its continental neighbours.He explained last week to the Nieuwsuur TV programme that the aim was for the virus to “circulate among people who will not have much problem with it, while simultaneously protecting vulnerable groups as far as possible”.The approach is far from universally accepted in the country, prompting some to call Van Dissel a “mad scientist”. Jon HenleyThe British public may only just have discovered Chris Whitty as the calm, clear-headed expert at the helm of the nation’s strategy to fend off coronavirus but he has long been regarded as a star in medical circles.A former epidemiologist, Whitty, 53, was professor of public and international health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) before being appointed chief medical officer in England and the UK government’s chief medical adviser a few months ago.He spent much of his childhood in northern Nigeria. His father, who was shot dead in Athens when Whitty was a teenager in an apparent case of mistaken identity, worked for the British Council. Witty still speaks warmly of Nigeria, colleagues said.His time in Nigeria may have shaped a passion for global health. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded him $40m (£31m) in 2008 for malaria research in Africa. A year later, he was appointed chief scientific adviser to the Department for International Development (DFID).Whitty works hard. He puts in 16-hour days and has still found time to study a law degree and MBA in his spare time. He is also accustomed to the spotlight. He was acting chief scientific adviser to the government during the novichok poisonings in Salisbury in March 2018.“He’s an absolutely extraordinary, brilliant man,” said David Mabey, a fellow LSHTM professor. “They couldn’t have a better person in charge. He’s exactly the man we need.” Ian Sample and Lisa O’CarrollProf Jérôme Salomon has emerged as France’s Monsieur Coronavirus, appearing every day to give serious and credible updates on the situation.“The prime minister wanted transparency and a permanent connection to the French people in whom they would have confidence,” a government insider told L’Obs. “Very quickly he realised Jérôme Salomon was the right person for the job.”Salomon, 48, has been number two at the French health ministry since January 2018. He is responsible for the government’s health policy and overseeing any health crises.He is a doctor who has specialised in public health and previously worked as a clinical manager and a hospital specialist in infections and tropical diseases. He has also carried out research into emerging diseases and epidemics, working on the 2009 H1N1 bird flu outbreak.Salomon represents France at the World Health Organization and has worked with several French health ministers. Tipped for that job when Emmanuel Macron was elected, he lost out to Agnès Buzyn, who recently resigned to stand for election as mayor of Paris.The former Socialist health minister Bernard Kouchner, for whom Salomon worked as an advisor in 2000, said the professor was “extremely brilliant, and has a more serious look about him than others”. Kim WillsherWalter Ricciardi is a member of the WHO’s European advisory committee and the Italian government’s coronavirus adviser. A former president of the country’s National Health Institute, he has urged draconian measures to try to contain the virus.A few days before the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, put the entire country under quarantine, Ricciardi told the : “The fact that the epidemic is still increasing substantially obliges us to take these measures, which of course are very extreme. I don’t think they have ever been taken in any other democratic country.”Both principled and outspoken, Ricciardi resigned as the NHI chief in early January 2019 over the then populist government’s “anti-scientific” policies, particularly regarding vaccinations.The previous government was led by a coalition of Salvini’s far-right League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which is in power with the centre-left Democratic party. All parties, including the opposition, have fully supported Italy’s drastic quarantine measures, which have not, unfortunately, prevented Italy overtaking China as the centre of the largest outbreak. Angela GiuffridaBrendan Murphy, Australia’s chief medical officer, has become a fixture on the country’s television screens, appearing alongside the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the health minister, Greg Hunt, at daily news briefings about the coronavirus.Murphy was supposed to step down from the role of principal medical adviser at the end of February and take up the role of health department secretary but as Covid-19 cases climbed and the first deaths from the disease in Australia were recorded at the beginning of March, he was asked to stay on until the crisis passes.A nephrologist, or kidney specialist, who has worked as a doctor, researcher and in health management for 40 years, he is accused by some of being unclear in his advice for managing the outbreak. This includes recommending that it was fine for people to continue to shake hands hours before Morrison told the country there were to be “no more handshakes”.There was also consternation when Murphy issued advice that the prime minister and cabinet did not need to self-isolate, despite having met the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, three days before he tested positive for the coronavirus.Dutton is believed to have contracted the virus while on a trip to the US, and those on his return flight, which occurred two days before the cabinet meeting, were asked to self-isolate.

Paul said he was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.The senator was on Capitol Hill this past week, including at a luncheon Friday among GOP senators.He spoke on the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon, addressing the coronavirus and an amendment he sponsored that would pay for virus relief efforts by withdrawing US forces from Afghanistan.A spokesman for Senator Jerry Moran, of Kansas, said Moran briefly saw Paul at the Senate gym Sunday morning and that he shared that information with GOP colleagues at a policy meeting.Moran “followed CDC guidelines and kept a safe distance between him and Senator Paul,” spokesman Tom Brandt said. Moran has spoken with the attending physician at the Capitol and has been told he does not need to self-quarantine, Brandt said.South Dakota Senator John Thune, the second-ranking Republican senator, said on the Senate floor that lawmakers will consult with the attending physician about all senators who have been in contact with Paul.Senator Mitt Romney, of Utah, said he was praying for Paul and noted that Paul’s health is compromised. Paul, 57, broke several ribs in 2017 when a neighbor assaulted him over a long-standing landscaping dispute. Paul, who was later awarded $580,000 in damages and medical expenses, had surgery last year to remove part of a lung damaged by the assault.Two House members, Representatives Mario Diaz Balart of Florida of Ben McAdams of Utah, have tested positive.The Senate was in session Sunday seeking a bipartisan response to the pandemic. If approved, the bill would be the third measure Congress has approved in response to the coronavirus this month.Paul, a deficit hawk, was among eight Senate Republicans who voted against a House-passed bill last week that provided more than $100bn to boost testing for the coronavirus and guarantee paid sick leave for millions of workers.He also was the only Republican senator who opposed an earlier bill authorizing $8.3bn for initial response to the coronavirus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48474b0dd292449be1ab1aa9c86d33c8fd829f7/0_164_3494_2097/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7542d09677912030d129efe6197e377c","title":"coronavirus symptoms what should i see a doctor","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the novel coronavirus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 22 March, more than 339,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 14,700 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 5,400 fatalities. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 98,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

If anything, the Bloomberg Global Health Index would suggest Italians have a healthier lifestyle than Germans.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.German politicians and senior health officials have been reluctant to comment on the low mortality rate while the situation is developing so rapidly. Lothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the government’s central public health body, has said he does not expect there to be a significant difference in mortality rates between Italy and Germany in the long run.“It’s too early to say whether Germany is better medically prepared for the Covid-19 pandemic than other countries,” said Marylyn Addo, who heads the infectiology department at Hamburg’s University Medical Centre.One likely explanation for the discrepancy in figures, Addo suggested, was that while northern Italy’s hospitals are being overrun with new patients, Germany’s are not yet at full capacity and have had more time to clear beds, stock up on equipment and redistribute personnel.“One advantage Germany has is that we started doing professional contact tracing when the first cases were reported,” Addo said. “It bought us some time to prepare our clinics for the coming storm.”Crucially, Germany started testing people even with milder symptoms relatively early on, meaning the total number of confirmed cases may give a more accurate picture of the virus’s spread than in other states.According to Germany’s National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, the country has capacity for about 12,000 Covid-19 tests per day, while Wieler has claimed it has capacity for 160,000 tests per week.While Germany has not tested its citizens at the same high rate practised in South Korea, guidelines have been in place for more than a month for people to be tested even if they have early-stage symptoms but have either had contact with an infected person or recently visited a “high-risk area” such as Lombardy in Italy or Wuhan in China.The age profile of those affected in the first few weeks has also been younger than in other countries, many of them fit and healthy people returning from skiing resorts in Austria or Italy, which would also help explain the low mortality rate.“I assume that many young Italians are or were infected without ever being detected,” Christian Drosten, a virologist at Berlin’s Charité hospital, told the newspaper Die Zeit. “This also explains the virus’s supposedly higher mortality rate there.”Drosten, who has been advising the German health ministry, has also warned that Germany’s mortality rate is likely to rise in the coming weeks as high-risk areas become harder to identify and testing capacity becomes stretched.“It will appear that the virus has become more dangerous, but this will be a statistical artefact, a distortion. It will simply reflect what’s already starting to happen: we’re missing more and more infections.”The methodology behind Germany’s data gathering could also play into the discrepancy between Italian and German figures.If a patient is tested positive for Covid-19 in Germany, the doctor will notify the local health authority, which will then digitally transfer the data to the Robert Koch Institute. The lag in this process explains why the RKI’s daily figures have been consistently lower than those from Johns Hopkins University, which updates its data tables more frequently. By 10am on Sunday morning, for example, the RKI only notes 55 fatalities in Germany.Unlike in Italy, there is currently no widespread postmortem testing for the novel coronavirus in Germany. The RKI says those who were not tested for Covid-19 in their lifetime but are suspected to have been infected with the virus “can” be tested after death, but in Germany’s decentralised health system this is not yet a routine practice.As a result, it is theoretically possible that there could be people who may have died in their homes before being tested and who do not show up in the statistics.Practising medical specialists such as Addo do not believe this number of unreported cases to be statistically significant. “I have yet to see any data that would suggest a large number of untested corona-related deaths that don’t show up in the statistics,” she said.“Clinics dealing with respiratory illnesses have been on high alert about the virus for weeks, so I would be very surprised if there was a significant figure of uncharted deaths.” The RKI’s official mortality figures include both people who have died of the virus as well as those infected and with underlying health problems, where the precise cause of death could not be determined."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05cb98a6f34e28503fd51083ed575f15843dd1be/0_147_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26fee7fde8b6a2d1849ecf38de292cc0","title":"london life lockdown coronavirus social distancing","story":"The strangest of weeks in the capital has left residents reeling as the unthinkable rapidly becomes the new normalI spent the first half-hour of Friday morning looking up competing dictionary definitions of the word “persistent”. My wife had woken up coughing and we were wondering whether this was the start of it – seven days of hopefully mild fever and quarantine for her, and 14 days inside for me and my daughter. While I was Googling those semantics, though, and adjusting to the realities they did or did not imply, the coughing stopped, and we all hung, waiting to hear what would come next.This strangest of weeks in the capital, in the country, in the world, has cast us all in that role, every hour.Social media memes from Spanish balconies the rolling TV news with its ever-present know-your-enemy virus graphic texts from friends in various shades of banter or distress Steve from the Wirral on a radio phone-in briefings from government ministers and scientists – all offer the newly housebound competing fragments to piece together as we try to understand what life looks like on the outside.That stay-at-home army has watched the terrifying pictures from Italy on a loop and tried to make sense of the numbers – that morbid Eurovision table of infections and deaths. Then, minute by minute, we have each hazarded a range of appropriate ways to respond: trying to move around cities without touching handrails, occupying imaginary two-metre bubbles in the park, coveting bottles of hand sanitiser, leafleting vulnerable neighbours for shopping orders, lying awake worrying about the rent or mortgage, planning garden projects, sharing lectures in epidemiology and crying over cancelled exams. We spend anxious time telling ourselves health is all that matters, fearing for jobs, setting up Skype accounts, cajoling parents and grandparents to stay indoors, keeping hands away from faces, going through stockpiled food too quickly, scrapping over loo roll, taking our temperatures, trusting official advice and not trusting official advice.One of the most remarkable lessons of the past seven days is just how quickly the mind can make the unthinkable thinkable. A week ago last Friday, Premier League fixtures and the Six Nations rugby were cancelled and there were still plenty of voices arguing overreaction sympathies were being extended to Liverpool fans. Since then we have not only quietly accommodated the closure of our schools and universities and offices, our theatres and cinemas and museums and places of worship – but demanded much more closure, much faster.If marching had been advisable the banners would have read: “Shut everything down now!” Can liberal voices ever have been more vehemently in favour of the imposition of martial law and the end of free assembly as they have been this week?Last Thursday evening, my Twitter feed had been so full of outrage about people “carrying on as normal”, drinking in pubs, going to shops, that I was moved to drive around the streets near where I live in London – through Camden and Islington and Holloway – to witness this “new Luftwaffe” for myself. At 9.30pm there was hardly a car on the streets, and those that were drove very slowly, as if not to disturb the unfathomable quiet. The pubs and restaurants were just about uniformly empty, lit up like a gallery of Edward Hopper paintings.Contrarily, then, the next afternoon, shops in my local high street were crowded, with people coughing nervously into their elbows, presumably convincing themselves, like me, that just going up the road for a loaf of bread or to pick up a prescription was obviously fine. We caught each others’ eyes at a safe-ish distance and smiled and shrugged. Normally you feel ashamed to be obsessing about trivial choices, but trivial choices now feel suddenly like the big questions. We have come to the end of the first urgent week of, “What exactly should we be doing?” and there are many more to come.In this new reality, everything can seem like a portent. We seize on pictures of full trains and we seize on pictures of empty trains. Walking home from the high street with my package of asthma inhalers I was thinking I didn’t yet know anyone directly who had the virus – and then that maybe I knew hundreds, untested.It was the first day of spring blossom two ambulances passed me on their way down the hill. At home, I opened emails from friends much, much closer to the advancing front line: one in Spain who is in the middle of cancer treatment, self-isolated in a bedroom at home and cheerfully determined to get through Ulysses, cursing the prospect of a €100 fine for stepping out into the sunshine the other a clinical director of a London hospital who says: “We created an initial isolation ward, which is now full, and just finished another ward today, which will likely be full by the weekend.”Tone becomes an issue. How do you check in with a friend who may or may not have lost their livelihood overnight? Too much gravity and you sound like a horseman of the apocalypse, but matey ironies have begun to sound hollow. I scroll through tweets at random a stranger writes, “My whole scale of preparedness is off. I’m a catastrophiser anyway, but I can’t gauge where catastrophe is at the moment. Am I being too paranoid? Not paranoid enough? Anxiety is mad at the best of times but now it’s got layers of mad.” I add to the hearts of agreement, and then, next one down, do my bit by offering advice to new-generation workers-at-home.Having mostly been in that particular self-isolation for 20 years now, I’ve narrowed the rules down to two: spend at least as much time in the day walking and talking as you do looking at a screen, and never work lying down. But of course, as I am writing that, I am realising that the new home-working is not the same as the old. It only really makes sense when you are alone. I was struggling to hit a deadline yesterday while my wife was on another Covid-19-crisis conference call with her office from the sofa and my daughter was playing the piano in the hall. In the absence of cafes, I have been checking out park benches with wifi signals. I am writing this at 5am. Unforeseen consequences are our only growth industry.In our semi-isolation, between calls in the living room, we occasionally look up from screens to confirm, “It’s so bloody weirdterrifying” or to ask, “What’s going to happen?” or to agree, “We’re the lucky ones with jobs.” We are already in the habit of convening at 5pm to watch the latest prime ministerial update. I have veered between thinking that the pacing of announcements has been well-judged in getting the whole population fully onboard, to terror at the gaps in provision.After Rishi Sunak’s extraordinary pledges to save the economy on Friday, I called my friend Tony, who owns a pub just off the Strand in London, the Devereux, which has been there since 1677, 12 years after the plague. He had watched the news with his last couple of regulars and confirmed that it all added up. “I’d already agreed to pay my staff for the duration,” he said, “though my accountant said I was mad. But this makes it possible. It’s sad to close of course, but I can see a way beyond it now. We’ll be fine.”Hearing he was about to close his doors for the summer, I got one of those quick, alarming flashes of what it all might possibly look like in a month or six. How much of the fabric of life can you take away before things start to fall apart?In the once-upon-a-time of last weekend, we’d gone out for breakfast to the local cafe, opening doors with our elbows, looking for an isolated corner table, half-joking that this might be the last meal out of the year. The Portuguese waitress, chatting about what it all might mean, and still hopeful that they could get through, had recommended I read José Saramago’s fable Blindness, in which a whole community is rendered sightless by a plague, apart from one woman, a doctor’s wife, who watches the world go mad around her.I Kindled it up last night and, as it unfolded in long spooling paragraphs, imagined myself in the role of the woman, and then of the population, before deciding that I’d best leave it for a month or six to find out how it all ended. Instead, I got involved in a Twitter conversation about which pub I’d go to first when the ban was over I thought about it long and hard. For me, I had to say, the Prince of Wales or the Eagle. It was much too close to call.• This article was amended on 21 March 2020. A picture caption was corrected to make clear that the man shown with a trolley was delivering stock to a shop.

In the bunk below, my cabinmate Oleg is dozing deeply. I might not be sleeping yet, but I will once I’ve found my sea legs. I’ve come a long way, I try to reassure myself, considering it’s only my fourth night at sea.When I arrived on board my temporary new home, Greenpeace’s MV Esperanza, even successfully navigating my way to the bathroom along the ex-Soviet firefighting ship’s labyrinth of narrow corridors had seemed impossible. The environmental NGO had invited me to join them on a month-long polar expedition departing from Patagonia, the final leg of a year-long project to draw attention to the existential threats facing the world’s oceans. The crew had set off from London, before travelling from pole to pole.Now though, after a series of briefings, tours and tips from seasoned crew members, I know where to do laundry, where to shower, where to muster in case of emergency. I can quickly put on an immersion suit. I understand three different types of alarm. I’ve scoped out the best hiding spots for when I’ll need some privacy: the cubbyhole library two nets on the boat’s stern where you can sit as the vast expanse of ocean stretches out behind you and if all else fails, the floor of the linen closet. I can even use the correct maritime terms to describe the different types of wild, sudden movement the boat is making as we cross the notoriously rough Drake Passage into Antarctic waters: “pitching” up and down, or “rolling” from side to side. Still, there’s little anyone can do to help with the tiredness, nausea and bumping into an endless number of metal things that comes with the all-consuming seasickness that has long settled in.Cruising along the Beagle Channel on our first morning – the calm, breathtaking 240km strait of water we’d sailed through after departing from Ushuaia, on the southern-most tip of Argentina – had lulled me into a false sense of security. “It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more beautiful than the beryl-like blue of these glaciers,” Charles Darwin wrote of the strait, after an expedition here in the 1830s. He was right. Mainland Argentina on one side, Chilean islands on the other, we’d been smoothly delivered from the final frontiers of South America towards Cape Horn and out into open oceans, passing snow-capped mountains and luscious greenery – albatrosses, whales and dolphins escorting us from above and below.I’d taken a single motion-sickness tablet as a precaution, after warnings from people who’d made the journey. Honestly? I didn’t understand the fuss. But it turns out that the Beagle’s waters are somewhat more sheltered than those of the wild and exposed Southern Ocean. Only a few days later I’m counting down the minutes until I can pop the next pill. Wave-hits-boat means head-hits-wall, again. That one was probably pitching, I mutter under my breath.There’s sunlight creeping in through the porthole now. For days, I’ve seen nothing but water. Staring out to the horizon is the only remedy for my unrelenting unease. I clamber quietly down from my bunk and head out for the relief some much-needed fresh air might bring.Stepping out into the crisp morning, though, a surprise is waiting. Three huge, jagged icebergs, somehow both deep blue and ghostly white in the orange light of dawn, jut out from the water right in front me, almost welcoming me into a corner of the world I imagined I’d only ever see on screen. A raft of penguins swims alongside. I’m channelling David Attenborough through my delirium. My stomach stirs with excitement – my first encounter with the Earth’s last great wilderness is all that I’d hoped for.In the distance, the peaks of the remote South Orkney Islands are appearing. I stand transfixed, the butterflies inside growing ever more restless. And then I run to the bathroom. What I thought was awe and wonder in my gut is, in fact, a sign that I’m about to puke.While landscapes come and go, and weather switches from blissful summer sunshine to blizzard and back again with little warning, the routine on board remains reassuringly constant. At 7.30am there’s a wake-up call while a help-yourself-breakfast wraps up in the mess. From 8 to 9am everyone pitches into the cleaning, and then the crew of 30 heads off to work. On the decks below, engineers and fitters keep us moving from the bridge, mates navigate. A team of deckhands dutifully ensures everything is in working order, while chef Willy prepares lunch for midday. A queue forms at his hatch on the dot.Unless you’re on watch duty, clocking off is at 5pm – just in time for an unofficial exercise class in the helicopter hangar or a smoke on the poop deck – before dinner is served up at 6pm. All the while, a small group of investigators, researchers and activists are plotting in a makeshift office. Because while the permanent crew keeps the boat running, it’s these campaigners who truly set its course.Greenpeace employs three ships to further its environmental efforts. Each is represented by a toy boat on a map pinned to a wall, reflecting their current positions. And as each traverses the oceans, an ever-changing team is drafted in from Greenpeace’s international offices to take the helm. From climate change to plastic pollution, deep-sea mining and oil drilling, all manner of issues have been explored on this ambitious voyage. Right now it’s an issue called “transhipping”.After arriving in the Antarctic proper three days earlier, we’ve anchored in a sheltered bay off the South Orkneys. Glaciers lead down to the water, which is peppered with icebergs. On a distant shoreline, a smattering of structures marks the British Antarctic Survey’s Signy Island Base. The waters might have calmed, but on board the atmosphere is anything but tranquil.Surrounded by maps, charts and laptops, Sophie Cooke, the mission’s lead investigator, is in the campaign room holding a briefing on a direct action set to take place the following morning. Transhipping, Cooke explains, is how fishing boats transfer their catch on to cargo vessels while at sea, swapping fish for fuel, workers and supplies. It’s a system that allows fishing operations to maximise profits, simultaneously making it possible to travel into distant waters with almost no need to return to port. Earlier that day, Greenpeace had published a report that was three years in the making it set out the harm transhipping can do, both to the oceans and the fishermen on board.It’s how, Greenpeace argues, illegal and unregulated fish are laundered into the market, which is estimated to be worth between $10bn and $23.5bn annually. (“Dodgy fish” is mixed together in freezers with more sustainable, better regulated catch.) Human rights abuses at sea – including poor working conditions and modern slavery – are well documented, and by transhipping, beyond scrutiny and national jurisdiction, such malpractice is too often out of sight and out of mind. There are three transhipment boats (known as reefers) currently in the South Orkneys, I’m told. Using complex satellite mapping and ship-tracking software, Cooke and her team have identified one of them – a cargo vessel they suspect has dodgy fish on board.They plan to attach a giant rubber fender – emblazoned with the words “Ocean Destroyer” – to the ship in question, and have a group of climbers scale the side using rope ladders, to conduct a vigilante inspection in an attempt to see what’s hiding in the ship’s refrigerated hold.The next morning, from a speedboat, I watch as the team pulls together with military precision. The distinction between crew and campaigner melts away.Everyone on board has a story explaining how they ended up here. It’s not the sort of job you can stumble into. For deckhand Usnea Granger, time spent fighting to save ancient Oregon woodland from deforestation as a teenager inspired her to pursue environmental activism. Chief mate Adrian Arauz describes the fields and rivers of his childhood in rural Panama. “It was instilled in me from an early age that we should take care of our surroundings, because in the end it’s nature that provides.”It was an oil spill off the coast of Galicia in northwestern Spain that first got a young Fernando Romo interested in marine conservation. He recalls with vivid clarity a childhood memory: walking down to the beach in his hometown to be greeted by washed-up dead wildlife, the sand drowning in crude oil. While working on a commercial tanker ship in the 1990s, he and his team were tasked with pumping oil-infused water into the sea. Soon after he became a member of Greenpeace. He was working on their ships by 2008, and promoted to the role of captain in 2017.Compared to my digs, Romo’s cabin is practically palatial. There’s an office with room for a desk and sofa, and penguin postcards pinned to a noticeboard. A thin curtain separates his sleeping quarters from where we’re sitting.“As captain, you’re the representative of a ship’s owner,” the 49-year-old says, “and you’re ultimately responsible for the whole operation of the ship.” In normal circumstances, say, on a cargo boat, that means getting your goods from port to port on time with no glitches. At Greenpeace, things are a little different: “We don’t deliver shipping containers, we win campaigns.”This adds another layer of responsibility and risk to Romo’s workload. He’s not just a sailor, he’s an activist, too. It means breaking laws and putting the boat into situations that most other captains would do everything in their power to avoid.That, Romo says, is how he stays positive. Eco-anxiety and burnout are common among environmental campaigners. I’d have imagined that spending every waking hour fighting for the planet’s future while witnessing firsthand parts of the world most vulnerable to the effects of climate catastrophe might be hard to handle.I don’t know why, but I arrived in the Antarctic expecting to come face to face with our shared, dystopian future. I thought that seals were going to be choking on plastic bags, that chunks of once pristine icebergs were going to be melting into piles of greyish mush. I thought it might trigger alarm bells. Instead, the air is fresher than any I’ve ever breathed, there’s wildlife in abundance, the seawater runs clear.But being here is an eerie reminder that we can’t wait for the consequences of climate change to be visible in places like this – it will be far too late by then. It’s no coincidence, I’m realising, that the only continent with no permanent population and few visitors is also the one in which nature has best survived the most damaging effects of humankind. And far from despairing, I feel myself becoming more determined than ever to help preserve this unsoiled natural world. It’s suddenly real, no longer an idea in the abstract, or a scene on TV. Spending time with people who’ve given their lives to defending it is a stark reminder that most of us can, and must, play a bigger part in its survival, if we’re to turn the tide.“If anything, I think working for Greenpeace has made me more hopeful,” Romo assures me. “You’re doing something positive and proactive, and seeing the results of your effort. Last time we came to Antarctica we were campaigning to make ocean sanctuaries to protect wildlife from overfishing. We didn’t achieve everything, but we forced the boats here into creating buffer zones for penguin feeding grounds, and that’s a win.” Romo isn’t complacent. That’s why they’ve come back again. “The climate emergency is the biggest threat to civilisation as we know it, and that’s a challenge. But if I’m going to be anywhere to fight it, here’s the right place to be.”Two or three weeks in, I’ve lost track of time completely. The team has turned its eye to scientific research. A high-tech underwater robot camera scours the seabed for trash and mysterious species, and we visit the colossal A-68, the largest iceberg to have broken off from the shelf. (It is twice the size of Luxembourg.) Through the mist, it stretches out as far as the eye can see in every direction, a sinister omen of what further global warming might bring.From the South Orkneys we sail closer to the Antarctic Peninsula, a strip of the continent that protrudes northwards into more navigable waters. I become spoilt: a few whales spotted starboard aren’t as close as the last pod with notes on a whiteboard updating me, the idea of having to plan my own day feels like a drag.There’s on-board wifi keeping me connected to civilisation, although how it works remains a mystery. (It involves, I’m told, a complicated satellite system.) Just a few years ago, being at the end of the world meant losing touch completely. If, say, a panic-inducing medical epidemic happened to sweep the world, you wouldn’t hear about it. I’m grateful I can Skype my family, but while being online is convenient, a part of me was hoping for a little more isolation. I wanted to switch off and experience time spent truly off-grid. Instead, I’m scrolling through Instagram, responding to work emails as if I’m sitting at my London desk. But then, one particularly bumpy afternoon, I drop my iPhone when a big wave hits, and the screen smashes to pieces, so I surrender myself completely to my life at sea.One day, a picture-perfect sunset appears over Discovery Bay, on the north side of the South Shetlands. I polish off my final bottle of stowed-away duty-free Malbec. Then Will McCallum, Greenpeace’s head of oceans, appears with the news I’ve been waiting for: my opportunity to set foot on the continent has finally come. “What we have seen sailing from the Arctic to the Antarctic was much more dramatic than we expected,” McCallum explains, “and ocean-going industries are paying scant attention to the need to rein in their worst excesses.” What is at stake, he says, is not only the survival of the creatures that inhabit the waters they’ve visited, but also life on this planet as we know it. The ocean sustains life on Earth by providing us with oxygen nearly half our planet depends on it for food. Here in the Antarctic, climate change means parts of the continent have reached unprecedented temperatures. Without urgent action the consequences of ice melts, and subsequent sea level rises, will be devastating.Conveniently for me, however, Greenpeace doesn’t just want to highlight destruction. With a team of photographers, videographers and social media types they want to document the continent’s beauty – to capture just what is at risk.A short trip in the speedboat and I’m standing alone on a green, mossy carpet atop a hill on Barrientos Island. Thousands of chinstrap and gentoo penguins are standing, swimming and shitting on all sides. In front of me, the infinite, silky ocean. Behind, mountains drenched in sun and thick, white snow. It’s bliss. Too soon, it’s time to head back to the Esperanza. A few days later, we’ll begin our long journey home.The sound of us upping anchor for a final time brings with it a sudden panic. My month at sea has left me institutionalised: once I disembark who’ll cook my lunch, pick the film, tell me when and where to be? Most of all, though, I fear I’ve taken my time soaking up the Antarctic’s splendour for granted. Did I make the most of it? What will I do when I look through a window and all this magnificence just isn’t there? I suppose those last ones are probably questions we all have to grapple with. Unless there’s a radical shift in how we interact with our precious planet, there might well come a day when we look up and it’ll have disappeared for good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17fa5535aff3c1e610f1e35759c9940a936e808d/0_11_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c574a1617c8dcbead9e1dc9efc37317","title":"which conditions mean that you should isolate for 12 weeks","story":"Government plans are for 1.5m people to ‘take themselves out of society’ for three monthsThe government announced on Sunday that it would be sending letters to 1.5 million people in England suffering from one of more than a dozen serious conditions which it is believed put them most at risk from coronavirus.Others have been urged to do everything they can to help the group, “whether it’s going shopping for a neighbour in need, or keeping inside if you know you’re at risk,” by health secretary Matt Hancock.The groups defined as “extremely vulnerable” who will receive the letter are:• People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical radiotherapy for lung cancer.• People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment.• People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer.• People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or Parp inhibitors.• People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6 months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs.• People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe COPD.• People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly increase the risk of infections (such as SCID and homozygous sickle cell).• People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of infection.• Women who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired.Those in the group are advised:• Strictly avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus.

That is a major concern for Hernando Enrique Mattos Dager, the rear admiral in charge of the Colombia’s Poseidon taskforce against drug traffickingThe rudimentary submarines, fashioned in secret workshops deep in the mangrove swamps of north-western Pacific coast, are notoriously difficult for navy patrols or radar to detect. They cruise “flush with the surface of the water, and the part that protrudes above the surface is very small,” Dager said.For all their recent success, Dager and his taskforce know that they have probably only encountered the tip of the iceberg. As with all interceptions of illicit drugs, the feeling once the initial euphoria subsides is that many more get through than are ever detected. The authorities seized 433 tonnes of cocaine in 2019, more than half by the navy, but production was estimated to be more than 1,000 tonnes.In November, a 22-metre semi-submersible vessel was intercepted on the other side of the Atlantic, off Spain’s Galician coast. It was carrying around three tonnes of cocaine, and two of its three crew members were reportedly from Ecuador.Evidence of the successes of Dager’s taskforce is littered among the mangrove roots around its base in the south-western port of Tumaco. The town is situated just north of the border with Ecuador in Nariño department, which has more land under coca cultivation than anywhere else in the country. It accounted for about a quarter of the 169,000 hectares (417,600 acres) under cultivation nationwide in 2018. Tumaco is known as “the pearl of the Pacific” for its stunning beaches, but it has also become a flashpoint in Colombia’s long fight against drug trafficking.Painted in blue, grey and pastel greens, the submarines’ fibreglass hulls appear to have more in common with Jules Verne’s Nautilus in his 19th-century novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea than a sophisticated seagoing submersible. But these low-profile boats are designed to take to the sea with their decks awash, carrying their cargo just beneath the waves and out of sight.Rumours that the cartels were using submarines began in the 1990s, and in 2006 the navy intercepted one off Costa Rica with 3.5 tonnes of cocaine on board.The cramped submarines are crewed by between two and four men, usually recruited from local fishing communities, often in Ecuador. If naval patrols discover them, the crew members “open valves to let in water and sink the vessel, sinking the evidence,” before jumping into the water, said Captain Victor Santos Pacheco, commander of the local coastguard, which often rescues crews from the sea.The vessels can reach Central America in two or three days. Those that head further north to the Mexican or US coast are replenished at sea with water, food and fuel, indicating elaborate logistics. Crew members can earn up to $50,000 (£43,000) for a long crossing, but see it as a risk worth taking, according to officials. “A kilo of cocaine is worth $30,000 on the streets of New York,” said Dager.The taskforce has recently seen evidence of an increase in the use of submarines to transport marijuana. “It could correspond to the fact that its consumption has been authorised in some countries,” said Dager. “This has opened up an interesting international market ... The production of marijuana in Colombia is very economical ... at $100 a kilo, and it sells for up to $7,000 in the US.”The cartels are constantly upping the ante in a cat-and-mouse game on the high seas. They are now using winged torpedo-like tubes known as “parasites” that are fixed to thehulls of large ships, Pacheco said. They also have a new tactic – a GPS-equipped “buoyed cargo” designed for clandestine recovery at sea.“Narco-trafficking is innovative. It never stops,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus 23 march at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Residents living in the city of 11 million people at the heart of the virus outbreak have been allowed to leave their residential compounds in small groups for the first time in weeks.

The woman had “multiple co-morbidities”, said Dr Mike Cruz, who is leading the coronavirus response in the US Pacific territory. Guam has 15 confirmed cases of the virus, the most of anywhere in the Pacific.Fiji confirmed its second case of Covid-19, and its first case of human-to-human transmission over the weekend, after the mother of a flight attendant, who was confirmed as being the country’s first case, also tested positive for the virus.There are huge fears across the Pacific region about countries’ ability to cope with the outbreak of coronavirus. Many Pacific nations face huge public health challenges, including outbreaks of mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever.

At the weekend, the first train arrived in the city ferrying more than 1,000 workers from elsewhere in the province back to the city for work.On Sunday, local authorities said residents could begin returning to work if they did not have a temperature and could provide a green health code, signifying their virus-free status as well as a certificate from their employer. Officials said the city would be “gradually” reopened and public transportation would resume.Non-residents, those stranded in Wuhan since the stringent travel restrictions went into effect on 23 January, could also begin applying to leave the city, city authorities said.Residents in Wuhan said only those from compounds deemed virus-free were allowed to leave and that citizens were still wary of going out onto the streets. “Everyone is being very careful,” said Iris Yao, 40, who has been in the city for the last two months.While the officially reported number of locally transmitted infections in China has dropped dramatically over the last weeks, imported cases continue to rise.On Monday, China reported 39 new cases from the previous day, all of which were from imported cases, according to the National Health Commission. On Sunday, China ordered that all international flights to Beijing to be erted to other cities where passengers will be screened before continuing on to the capital. Shanghai and Guangzhou have said they will begin testing all international arrivals for the virus.In another sign that normal life was starting to return in China, there were reports of traffic jams in Beijing on Monday morning.There have now been over 81,000 cases in China, and the death toll has reached 3,270.The loosening of restrictions in Wuhan came as other nations intensified their response to the virus. In the US, President Donald Trump activated the National Guard in New York, California and Washington state, three of the states hardest hit by Covid-19. Trump said additional supplies will also go the three states, including extra beds and facemasks.Trump also said he had directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to set up “medical stations” in those three states. He said: Four large medical stations with 1,000 beds for New York, eight large federal medical stations with 2,000 beds for California, and three large federal medical stations and four small federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for the state of Washington.”On Sunday evening the city faced shutdown after governor Andrew Cuomo ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses in the state. Except for essential services, all New Yorkers were ordered to stay indoors from 8pm Sunday evening.The closure came as Democrats blocked an economic stimulus package, claiming it favoured big business over the rights of workers. Trump has faced growing anger over his response to the outbreak. The president has tried to blunt criticism, saying help was on the way for states that need it.By the end of Sunday, nearly one in three Americans was under orders to stay home as Ohio, Louisiana and Delaware became the latest states to enact broad restrictions.On the other side of the Pacific, New Zealand’s prime minister announced the nation would go into lockdown on Wednesday for a month to stem the spread of the virus.

In my birth country of Sudan, after only one case and one death was registered, all schools and universities were shut down. Several other nations, such as Egypt, have taken the ultimate precaution and closed their airports.There is no denial here, no mixed messaging, and no unfounded promise of how soon we will send the virus packing.The tough and timely action is borne less out of political maturity than it is bitter experience, and an awareness that already overburdened public healthcare systems cannot sustain an onslaught. The ebola epidemic of 2014 is still fresh in the mind in sub-Saharan African countries it was an experience that showed prevention and containment are the only hope of fending off thousands of deaths.If we are concerned about the failure to contain the virus in western Europe and the US, multiples of that horror await in the developing world. With few means of medical intervention, and several other risk factors such as malnutrition, high population densities, communal living and lack of access to water and washing facilities, the rates of mortality could dwarf what has been seen so far in the west. And economically, the virus risks ushering in an ice age. There are no war chests, no stimulus packages, no insurance payouts.There is something painfully predictable about how coronavirus was introduced to the continent. Well-off travellers to the rest of the world returned from holidays and business trips carrying the virus, as did infected tourists. In Egypt, the first cases of Covid-19 appear to be linked to one cruise ship, where locals who served the tourists contracted the disease.The spread of the virus on the continent sits in the crosscurrents of travel and financial flows that expose African countries to the sharp end of globalisation – one where the flow of people is encouraged into the continent for business and tourism, and severely restricted out of the continent even for the wealthy and well connected.It is the recurring theme of how the pandemic has played out so far. The poor, the uninsured, the disenfranchised, the information-poor and the less mobile are sitting ducks. Many western economies, including the US and the UK, have slowly pushed these people to the margins, while restricting employment benefits such as holiday pay, sick leave, and private insurance to an increasingly exclusive class. One of the reasons the British and US governments have been so slow to provide free testing, medical care and bailouts for those who’ve lost work is that these inequalities are now hardwired into the system. They cannot be undone overnight even when lives depend on it.The global economy is set up in much the same way, with winners who hoard the spoils, and losers who scratch around for the leftovers. If wealthy single countries cannot scramble to save their own people, there is no hope for any effort to extend help to countries with a fraction of the resources.But here is the tragic catch for those who think that this structural imbalance is not our problem. In this instance, national and international inequalities cannot persist without everyone losing. The realisation is just beginning to dawn upon lawmakers that the rich cannot be barricaded against the poor, no matter how high the barriers to the fortress are. Limiting the spread of the virus entails ensuring that everyone in the pool, be it local or global, is given the ability to test, self-isolate if need be, and receive treatment.Yes, to some extent this is a utopian aspiration. But it is also essentially pragmatic. We cannot extol the virtues of small government and global societies without grasping that the risk to the majority cannot be halted from spreading: viruses do not distinguish between classes and nationalities.Just as work and public life cannot be shuttered for ever, borders cannot be closed indefinitely. African countries are moving fast against coronavirus, well aware that they are on their own. But barring a miracle, or a pandemic Marshall plan by wealthier countries, if the virus explodes in poorer countries, the cataclysm will engulf everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178All jury trials to be suspended in bid to combat coronavirus, Lord Chief Justice announcesMonday morning news briefing: 24 hours to avoid total lockdownCoronavirus latest news: Harvey Weinstein tests positive in New York prison Comment: We were wrong: this isn’t a war, it’s a plagueFrom Tom Hanks and Harvey Weinstein to Michel Barnier, coronavirus hits celebrities, sports stars and politiciansLondon lockdown: Are shops closed, is the Tube running and can I leave the house? Coronavirus school closures: what does it mean for exams - and which children can still go to school?Can I go for a walk outside?

The non-binary singer who insists on gender-neutral pronouns (“Theythem”) posted a video clip of themselves having what my dad would have called “the ab-dabs” on social media this week. Having selflessly entered self-isolation at their £12 million home on Thursday, by Friday they were weeping like a girl (sorry, like an assigned at birth cis female) because they were already bored with their own company.“I hate reading!”, they confessed, suggesting that if you have no life of the mind you’ll always be a bad friend to yourself – even if you do refer yourself in the plural.But it could be worse Smith could have joined the other celebrities treating us to their own stardust-sprinkled version of the ghastly John Lennon song Imagine.I’ve had “issues” with this song forever, summing up perfectly as it does Lennon’s weapons-grade hypocrisy. While encouraging the hoi polloi to “imagine no possessions”, he and his consort kept a whole apartment in the Dakota building where they lived in New York for the exclusive occupation of their fur coats, just to keep them at the right temperature.Elton John nailed it in his autobiography: “The various apartments the Lennons owned … were so full of priceless artworks, antiques and clothes that I once sent them a card, rewriting the lyrics to Imagine: Imagine six apartments, it isn’t hard to do, one is full of fur coats, another’s full of shoes.’’In fact, Lennon was forever ready to take his non-specific rage out on someone, provided, of course, that person was powerless. In his actions – as opposed to his statements and his songs – he exhibited largely selfishness and spite. To be fair, the new Imagineers aren’t in the same camp as Lennon. They’re lovely to look at (Wonder Women from Lynda Carter to Gal Gadot, actresses Natalie Portman and Cara Delevingne) and extremely accomplished (songwriter Sia, singer Norah Jones, comic Will Ferrell) and they mean well.But scratch a showboating altruist and you’ll often find an attention whore I know, because I’m one. I get to show off in print and I’m good at it, but performers in other areas can’t do their thing alone. It’s driving them nuts that no one’s looking at them, hence Michele Pfeiffer posted a video of herself working out while Bob Geldof rang up a TV show to announce his own self-isolation.It’s touching to look at celebrities and see how unconscious they are of their vulnerability George Michael, who knew about these things, once defined a star as “someone with a little something missing rather than a little something extra”.They need their fans – but their fans do not need them although they may momentarily enjoy their singing voices or good looks. When the famous attempt to parlay this passing fancy into actual power, it falls flat each time a celebrity urged people not to vote for Trump or Brexit, it seems they caused another thousand to do so.And they will be heeded less than ever as we plunge deeper into the plague year. Gadot said that she had been inspired by the Italian videos of neighbours singing to each other on their balconies ironically it’s this development that shows how superfluous stars are.Transcendence was just around the corner all along – and we don’t need to pay for it. Like the tree falling in the metaphorical forest, when a star smiles and no “civilian” watches, does the star still feel happiness?I’m sure we will see much more of them getting their flashing-fix in the guise of giving something to the Little People before we’re out from under lockdown.But eventually even these most unrealistic of beings will realise that the achievements of the rich and famous count for nothing in a new world in which those who do the most arduous and thankless labour are – at long last – the most honoured. We will look back in wonder that we once called dress designers ‘visionaries’ and disc jockeys ‘superstars.’At a time singularly short of silver linings, this must be one.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Soft-boiled eggs, hard-boiled eggs, scrambled eggs – and where in the whole of London we could find the city’s last carton of precious, best-laid eggs.“Got any eggs?” were my husband’s first words when he rang his parents yesterday. Not an egg to be had in all of Berkshire. Two girlfriends, one pregnant, one breastfeeding, both depleted, tell of kind neighbours leaving bubble-wrapped eggs on the doorstep.I am kicking myself for not buying the only option left on the shelves in Waitrose on Friday: a single packet of quail’s eggs. It felt a bit Marie Antoinette-ish in the face of a global pandemic. My editor reports a similar dilemma faced by her uncle at Portobello Market: duck eggs or bust. On Saturday morning, after a fruitless – or should that be yolkless? – search of six shops, I came home with a bottle of Fairy Liquid and a bunch of hyacinths. Very cheering, but not much cop on toast. Hen’s eggs have become as rare as hen’s teeth.Who bought all the eggs? Who on Sunday morning sat down to a five-egg frittata? Who is broodily clucking over their hoard while the rest of us go without?I’m still horrified by a conversation three years ago with my driving instructor about his diet. Each morning, he boiled six eggs, cut them in half, scooped out and threw away the yolks, and ate the whites. It was appalling then, unforgivable now.After a week without omelettes, some are panic-buying bantams. (Insert joke about headless chickens here.) Poultry breeders report soaring sales. Rosehill Hatchery in Hanningfield, Essex, sold 300 hens in just two days. On Thursday, it shut up coop. Sales of the “Eglu” – a chicken igloo – are up 66 per cent in Europe and the US. Looking out at the fire escape, six floors up in central London, I wonder whether it is practical to recreate The Good Life in Paddington. Perhaps not.May the nation’s Leghorns, Orpingtons and Lincolnshire Buffs rise to the occasion. Girls, get laying! Your country urgently, hungrily needs you.Talking of girls cooped up together, the BBC is to bring forward its adaptation of Enid Blyton’s Malory Towers boarding school books to entertain children starting what promises to be a very long Easter holiday.

What would the BBC producers think of my childhood spent playing First Term At Mallory Towers with pneumatic Barbie dolls cast as the “feminist role models” Darrell, Sally and Mary-Lou? (I wasn’t the wokest of six-year-olds.)Still, the resolute jolliness of the North Tower girls could prove an inspiration in these anxious times. Anyone caught moping about loo roll, cancelled flights or cabin fever should be silenced with a rousing: “Cheer up, Gwendoline!” And all stockpilers are to be immediately punished with lashings of extra prep.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

They’ve not been back to the UK. Libya is quite a difficult place to do anything with at the moment. “It was difficult enough getting Hashem Abedi back. I think we have to be very careful about how we approach people in Libya. We have not spoken to the parents.“We have made requests of Libyan authorities in relation to other areas of the investigation. Clearly there are circumstances about  the management of the parental home, circumstances about the management of the finances that relate to that.”Following his release from detention in Tripoli, Ramadan moved back to a large rented property in the city.But the family were forced to flee their home after the area where they lived became a frontline in the latest round of fighting between Libya’s two main armed factions, the UN-backed Government of National Accord and the rival Libyan National Army.They relocated to another rented property in the Libyan capital, but refused to discuss the attack by their sons.One local Libyan journalist told The  that Ramadan had regularly been seen around Tripoli often seen drinking tea in local cafes, but had been making regular trips to Istanbul for medical treatment.His hospital bills are understood to be paid for by the Libyan government, for whom he worked in the past as a civil servant in the Ministry of Interior.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/22/TELEMMGLPICT000228365598_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBDCnIxthzPLaVuHdTEmpqJRQxFEnemAQdOy_hncTgwo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"necessity proves mother invention coronavirus torn country","story":"Zac looks through the window at Vera Barnett after delivering a carvary from the Sneyd Arms on Mother\u0026#39s Day in Keele, Newcastle-under-Lyme Mother’s Day 2020. At once a deeply heart-rending and unexpectedly uplifting moment in these extraordinary times. The poignant absence of the nation’s mothers was the central focus.But the human, humane response from their children served as a tribute to Britain’s ingenuity and good humour, even in the grip of a deadly pandemic. Some spoke on the phone or waved through windows to their mums. Others harnessed modern technology and FaceTimed from their front rooms or went back to basics and asked their local radio station for a special dedication.Across the UK, families strove to find novel ways to spread good cheer rather than the coronavirus.On social media, David Kenworthy made light of stockpiling by tweeting “Best Mother’s Day gift ever. No 1 son” beside a screenshot of Andrex loo roll.Elsewhere, two sisters arrived at their mum’s house with a bouquet in full protective gear, including masks.A middle-aged woman was filmed several metres away from her elderly mother and holding up handwritten signs by way of homage to the scene in Love Actually some were brought to tears by the tenderness of the messages.Celebrities including Victoria Beckham, Amanda Holden, Piers Morgan and Ant and Dec went online to post throwback photographs of themselves with their mothers “in happier times”.And then there were snapshots of beaming children standing outside grandmothers’ houses and adults amiably drinking tea separated from their pensioner parent by the glass wall of the conservatory.Jennifer Grover, 84, a retired housewife and health worker from Sutton in Surrey, was “visited” by three of her 17 grandchildren via Skype. “We used it this morning for half an hour and that was lovely,” she said. “It was a new and very different experience.“It’s just because they haven’t been able to see me in person and it was the next best thing.”But despite the inventiveness and the smiles, Mothering Sunday has given us all pause for thought.Who could have imagined just six months ago that the simple act of visiting our own mothers would become a life or death decision?The coronavirus has changed the world. Changed us.On Sunday, as the Prime Minister urged the nation to stay indoors, and medical experts begged us to keep the elderly and the infirm safe, a generation of mothers sat home alone.There were no joyful family gatherings. No hand-delivered chocolates from prodigal sons. No fierce hugs and beribboned gifts from daughters. No inky home-made cards and fairy cakes from grandchildren.It was for their own good. Our own good. Society’s own good. That did not make it easy to bear.As James Mitchinson, editor of The Yorkshire Post, tweeted to his readers: “This #MothersDay you can give your mum something quite special. A few more years of life on this planet to enjoy their retirements, their grandchildren, the simple things.“Please don’t put them in grave danger for the sake of sentiment.”In London, Kensington Palace shared a message from Heads Together, their mental health charity, which asked people to get in touch with those who found Mother’s Day difficult, including those who have lost their mothers, their own children or could not be with them.It was a reminder that despite social distancing, we can – must – continue to connect in other ways. Sunday offered the perfect opportunity.Unlike Valentine’s Day with its exploitative blizzard of hearts and orchestrated schmaltz, the promotion of Mothering Sunday has always felt entirely benign.It represents a welcome nudge to remember the incredible, selfless women who birthed us, reared us and made us who we are. Some of us discover that we had no real inkling of how much, how unconditionally, our mothers loved us until we had children of our own.And so Mother’s Day has evolved into a unique and uniquely intimate date in the calendar. A harbinger of spring, it is reverently set aside for quiet joy green-tipped bulbs pushing through the dark earth of Marks \u0026amp Spencer planters, glasses of generic fizz (mothers invariably cavil at the extravagance of champagne) or a stroll around a National Trust property.Coronavirus UK and regional map ..Not this year. Stately piles are closed. The shops are deserted, restaurants have brought the shutters down in a bid to kill off Covid-19 before it wipes out a generation.With inventiveness and determination a great many of us joyfully marked Mother’s Day.But the bleak reality is that the risk we – any one of us – pose to our parents extends far beyond this one day. It reaches into tomorrow, next week, next month.If we can’t visit our mothers on Mother’s Day, when can we? That is the harrowing question nobody dares ask because nobody can answer.   The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Identity politics now feels like a madness from another age. Nobody is complaining about the gender balance of the team of experts guiding the nation’s response (well, nobody apart from Amber Rudd, who got short shrift when she made that point on Twitter last week).The war on coronavirus has, in part, made the war on plastic redundant. Reusable coffee cups were judged a health risk by cafés which, before they were ordered to close, required customers to return to the old disposable ones. In the United States, new regulations restricting the use of plastic bags are being suspended, and one mayor has even called for a ban on the American equivalent of “bags for life”, given that (unwashed) they could end up spreading this virus.There are whisperings that similar measures could follow here, with supermarkets reportedly urging the Government to waive the bag tax. Old, pointless regulations are being discarded -such as those preventing some pubs or restaurants from offering takeaways.This will only be the start. Over the past few decades, planning authorities, architects, and builders have conspired to ensure that the UK now has among the smallest new homes in Europe. Fine, this may partly be a consequence of higher population density, but then why are Dutch homes significantly bigger? As people coop up in self-quarantine, with little space for food and other essentials, one long-term consequence should be an end of policies that promote extreme densification.That ought to mean an expansion of suburbs, more garden cities and market towns outside of our major conurbations, and an end, too, to the blind assumption that the “agglomeration” of everything, or radical centralisation, is an unalloyed good. Social distancing is much less traumatic when people have their own gardens.A newly-germaphobic society will have less slavish respect for public transport over the hermetically-sealed personal motor vehicle. Is the Government going to push ahead with its premature ban on diesel, hybrid and petrol cars? Some changes will be less welcome. Expect privacy considerations to be given less weight in public policy decisions, especially those related to technology. This has already started, with governments openly tracking the movements of populations via their mobile phone signals, in order to monitor whether social distancing is being adhered to.Then there are all the faddish projects that, until just a few weeks ago, were animating our politics. Rightly or wrongly, ministers have chosen to destroy our economy (hopefully temporarily) in order to limit the spread of coronavirus. We have also discovered that we are not, really, in a significantly better position than countries that are much poorer and less developed. In the cold light of this new era, HS2 looks even more absurd. Are we really proposing to push ahead with a £100  billion-plus vanity project? Much that was certain now looks very decadent indeed.Monday morning news briefing: 24 hours to avoid total lockdownCoronavirus latest news: Harvey Weinstein tests positive in New York prison Comment: We were wrong: this isn’t a war, it’s a plagueFrom Tom Hanks and Harvey Weinstein to Michel Barnier, coronavirus hits celebrities, sports stars and politiciansLondon lockdown: Are shops closed, is the Tube running and can I leave the house? Coronavirus school closures: what does it mean for exams - and which children can still go to school?Can I go for a walk outside?

In return she “would be taken care of for the rest of her life”.However, she instead escaped during a trip to Thailand, according to a book written by American lawyer Bradley Edwards - who has represented Epstein’s victims.She had already been involved in the “sex cult” for over two years when she was asked to bear Epstein’s child, Mr Edwards claims in his book, Relentless Pursuit, which is being serialised in the Mail on Sunday.He describes how Epstein and Maxwell allegedly came up with a proposal that “turned her stomach” and included signing a contract agreeing that “the baby was not her own, but the legal child of Epstein and Maxwell”. Mr Edwards has represented Epstein’s victims for 11 years and “pursuing Epstein” on their behalf became his “life mission”, he writes in his book.He describes how Ms Giuffre Roberts was a “striking 16-year-old with drive and a determination to improve herself” when she was first approached by Maxwell in 1999 and given an envelope “with directions to Epstein’s address”.Mr Edwards writes that after arriving at the property, “Maxwell instructed her on every aspect of how to perform a massage” before Maxwell ended up “stripping off all her clothes and telling Virginia to do the same. Epstein then sexually assaulted Virginia. ‘Doesn’t that feel good?’ he asked.”Ms Giuffre Roberts would later show the lawyer the envelope, as well as “travel and hotel receipts charged to Epstein’s card”, as proof of some of her allegations.“Not long afterwards, Virginia showed me a photograph of herself, aged 17, wedged in between Maxwell and Andrew”, Mr Edwards claims in his book.It was two years later that Ms Giuffre Roberts was asked to carry Epstein and Maxwell’s baby. At that point, Mr Edwards writes, she “knew she had to escape”.The lawyer alleges that it was on a trip to Thailand, where Ms. Roberts Giuffre was dispatched to interview a “young girl, and let Epstein know if she was ‘qualified’”, that she fled and met an Australian man. The pair then married and flew back to Australia, where she had three children.Ms Roberts Giuffre, now 36, has claimed repeatedly that she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with the Duke when she was aged 17 at Ms Maxwell’s home in Belgravia, London.The Duke categorically denied her allegation during his Newsnight interview, insisting it “simply didn’t happen” and that on the day in question he was at a Pizza Express in Woking.He has also strongly denied having sex with Ms Giuffre Roberts in New York and on Epstein’s private island in the Virgin Islands.Earlier this month, The  revealed that Prince Andrew has hired Clare Montgomery QC, Britain’s most respected extradition lawyer, to fend off an FBI inquiry into his friendship with Epstein.Ms Montgomery’s clients have included Augusto Pinochet, Chile’s former dictator and Nirav Modi, wanted for India’s biggest fraud. She has been described as “the most formidable member of the bar.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rural residents tell visitors go home parks beauty spots packed","story":"A backlash against people ignoring social distancing saw people in rural communities telling visitors to go home on Sunday because parks and beauty spots were packed with visitors.Some tourist destinations and National Parks saw their busiest ever days over the weekend as people ignored the advice to stay two metres apart to enjoy the sunshine.In updated advice issued on Sunday, the culture department said essential travel does not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays and that people should remain in their primary residence.The National Trust, the Royal Horticultural Society and a London council were among those that announced that they were to close all their venues as they could not guarantee the safety after visitor numbers spiked.The Mother\u0027s Day influx into parks and beaches even led to tourism boards asking people to stay away, with Visit Wales putting out the message: “Visit Wales. Later.”There are concerns that an increase in people travelling into rural communities, which already have a high proportion of elderly residents, will put unsustainable pressure on local health and social care services and shops.Some rural communities have warned that people are attempting to isolate themselves in remote areas amid petitions for caravan parks to be closed.Judy Murray, mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie Murray, tweeted a simple message to those relocating to the countryside - a picture of a car and trailer with Go home idiots and Covid-19 painted on the side.Other social media users shared pictures and videos of packed parks and car parks as they described people as “covidiots”Boris Johnson said that the Government would be thinking very actively in the next 24 hours about taking further measures to prevent social distancing.He told a press conference on Sunday that I don\u0027t want to do that as it is so important that people are able to go out, but said that freedom can only really be preserved if everybody acts responsibly and conforms with those principles of staying apart from one another and social distancing.The Prime Minister added that if people can\u0027t make use of parks and playgrounds in a way that observes 2 metre rule then we\u0027re going to have to look at further measuresThe National Trust said on Sunday that they would close all parks, gardens, houses, shops and cafes as well as car parks for countryside and coastal locations because of high demand.Director-general Hilary McGrady said the trust would be taking measures to ensure that people do not lose their connection with nature, and that the sites of natural beauty remain open virtually.Snowdonia National Park Authority said its area experienced its busiest ever visitor day in living memory on Saturday, with so many people that it was “impossible to maintain effective social distancing”.Chatsworth House, Whipsnade Zoo and the Yorkshire Wildlife Park also announced that it would be closing its doors.Some DIY stores and garden centres reported being busier than Bank Holiday weekends when visitor numbers are normally at their peak.Britain is not the first country to see a rush to beauty spots, with visitor destinations across the world being overwhelmed. The Australian Government this weekend closed Bondi Beach in Sydney because of overcrowding.But it was not just rural areas and beauty spots that experienced high numbers of visitors.Londoners were criticised for attending “packed” markets including in Victoria Park and the famous flower market on Colombia road.Hammersmith and Fulham council announced that as of 7pm last night (SUN) all the parks would be closed in the borough until further notice, adding: “Please stay home, save lives.”The Royal Parks closed their parks on the outskirts of London to all traffic and all their remaining takeway cafes and kiosks as “people are not adhering to social distancing guidelines”.A spokesman warned that they were keeping the situation under review and if the rules continue to be ignored “we will have no choice but to consider closing the parks”.Many are concerned that with London the worst hit and with the schools shut the situation in the countryside will get worse unless action is taken.Kate Forbes, SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, said that there “has been an influx of campervans and traffic with people living in cities to what they think is self-isolation. But this is not a wildness this is a place where people live.”George Freeman, MP for Mid Norfolk, tweeted: “To those people with 2nd homes in Norfolk: PLS DONT flee London to come to Norfolk” adding that they risked “spreading the virus”.Nicola Sturgeon yesterday moved to stem a flood of people into the Highlands trying to escape the coronavirus by barring them taking ferries to the islands and telling all accommodation providers to stop accepting visitors.The First Minister said all hotels, bed-and-breakfasts and self-catering providers should only be housing staff and essential workers, amid fears local rural hospitals could collapse under the pressure.First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford also warned: Social distancing includes avoiding all but essential travel and if people don\u0027t follow this advice we will have no choice but to use powers to enforce it.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"smell taste should included official list coronavirus symptoms","story":"The official list of coronavirus symptoms should be expanded to include loss of smell and taste, senior medics have demanded, as patients also report stomach pains and sore eyes.Ordering those with impared smell and taste to self-isolate could significantly slow the spread of Covid-19, the experts said.Currently, the government demands only that people with a persistent dry cough or a high temperature, or both, self-isolate for at least seven days to protect the wider public. However, specialist doctors say that in recent days they have been “inundated” with a wave of patients reporting the sudden loss - usually within 24 hours - of their sense of smell and taste.Only a minority have gone on to develop the formally recognised symptoms of Covid-19.Those who have called NHS 111 have allegedly been told they need not self-isolate.It is understood that the chief medical officer and SAGE, the scientific group advising the government, are considering evidence of loss of smell and taste closely.Professor Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, told The Daily  that, in the absence of adequate coronavirus testing, taste and smell loss could be a powerful means of identifying the otherwise asymptomatic super-spreaders - many of them young people - who endanger others.I think it\u0027s really important that we extend the criteria for which people self-isolate to include anybody with loss of taste and loss of sense of smell,” she said.“It’s critical that we identify patients who are asymptomatic to slow the spread of this disease.”Her comments follow a recommendation on Friday by Jerome Salomon, France’s top health official, that people experiencing anosmia contact their doctor, although Professor Hopkins said that, providing they were otherwise asymptomatic, people should simply self-isolate rather than contact the NHS.She said medical colleagues involved in the coronavirus response in Northern Italy had told her they believed around 50 per cent of doctors had temporarily lost their sense of taste or smell.“I’m aware that doctors on the front line in Italy, Iran and France are actively looking out for this as a sign of infection, she said.The symptoms have been seen in previous coronaviruses, but nearly always alongside the classic viral symptoms of coughing and high temperature.Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “If it really is an early feature then that would be really useful to know, but it can’t be on the basis of hearsay.”It came as a debate flared up among scientists over the extent to which diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal problems are common symptoms of Covid-19.A paper published this week in the American Journal of Gastroenterology found that approximately half of a sample of 204 patients admitted to hospital in Hubei province, China were suffering from these symptoms.However, Professor Hunter said this study was likely to be an outlier, and that most other research suggested that, at most, around 10 per cent of Covid-19 patients are affected.Coronavirus is hard to stop spreading because of the incubation period, the time between infection and the moment they start displaying symptoms.The government has been heavily criticised for the lack of testing, prompting Boris Johnson to announce last week that the number of daily tests would jump from 4,000 to 25,000.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/20/TELEMMGLPICT000228239338_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqulmngyk1nEPNRM5Qu5tZfsNXlHzFQX0q9rbqpSNZfi0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"writing plague diary may history one day","story":"Fraught though this period is, we are keenly aware that these are extraordinary times.I’ve started keeping a coronavirus diary to while away the hours under lockdown. Samuel Pepys it ain’t. There are no raucous ballads in taverns and vanishingly few extramarital assignations with pot-boys in back-alleys, or whatever the female version of Pepys’s escapades would be. Entries are rather more trivial, of the “Sasha texted” or “Call from Mum” variety.Alongside signs of the virus’s advance – friends taken ill, lying awake to the blaring of ambulance sirens – there is the banality of life cooped up procrastination, fruitless attempts to resist gorging on the block of Cheddar in the fridge through sheer boredom (though Pepys, who famously tried to shield a valuable Parmesan from the flames of the Great Fire by burying it in his back garden, might have empathised).While my mundane musings are unlikely to fascinate future generations, something compelled me to document this moment. The adage “History never looks like history when you are living through it” isn’t true of coronavirus. Fraught though this period is, we are keenly aware that these are extraordinary times.Perhaps this is why the virus demands historical comparisons. Many invoke the Spanish flu or the Plague, despite our superior hygiene, medicine and communications. For Pepys, the plague year was one of the happiest of his life. As the bodies piled up, he enjoyed a euphoric few months he was elected to the Royal Society, acquired a 12ft telescope and revelled in his sexual encounters. But, like us, Pepys was constantly worried about the disease’s spread. He lost friends, and kept a nervous eye on death rates, tracking the disease’s progress towards London The plague is got to Amsterdam, brought by a ship from Argier, The plague is very hot still, and encreases among the Dutch, he noted in 1664. Others have likened the current pandemic to the Second World War. The trouble with this analogy is that “Blitz spirit” hinged on community, whereas the coronavirus has the unpleasant effect of destroying many of our social networks. And where’s the heroism? Save for those fighting the disease on the front line and keeping essential services and food supplies going, our patriotic duty (staying in) is inherently dull. It’s hard to channel Douglas Bader or Vera Lynn when you’re sitting around in your pyjamas.Coronavirus, then, is its own beast. But one thing remains certain. Looking back at when history was made is always fascinating just as living through it is always trying. Perhaps one day, my children will ask: “What did you do during the coronavirus, Mummy?” To which I will reply: “Well, darling, I rearranged my bookshelves and binge‑watched Netflix.” Give me a few months and the answer will be more Pepysian: “I developed gout for my country.”But however pedestrian the day-to-day reality, we are living through a supreme test of our national and global mettle. Events like last week’s will be discussed in 100 years’ time, just as dates like 1665 or 1918 remain the highlights of preceding centuries. Time will tell how history will judge us.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Now the charity, together with the University of Gloucestershire, is undertaking tests to establish the giant\u0027s age.Archaeologists have excavated small trenches to enable samples of soil to be extracted from points on the giant\u0027s elbows and feet.Over the coming weeks, Professor Phillip Toms, from the University of Gloucestershire, will attempt to date the samples using a technique called optically stimulated luminescence (OSL).Martin Papworth, a senior archaeologist at the National Trust, said: The OSL technique is commonly used to determine when mineral grains in the soil were last exposed to sunlight.It was used to discover the age of the Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire in the 1990s, which was found to be nearly 3,000-years-old - even more ancient than we had expected.We\u0027re expecting the results of the tests in July. It is likely that the tests will give us a date range, rather than a specific age, but we hope they will help us better understand, and care for, this famous landmark.Gordon Bishop, chairman of the Cerne Historical Society, said villagers were eagerly awaiting the results.Although there are some who would prefer the giant\u0027s age and origins to remain a mystery, I think the majority would like to know at least whether he is ancient or no more than a few hundred-years-old, he said.Whichever may be the case, he is unique.In separate analysis, environmental archaeologist Mike Allen will analyse soil samples containing the microscopic shells of land snails to learn more about the site\u0027s past.There are 118 species of snails in Britain and many of them are habitat specific, so their preserved shells can help us establish what a landscape was like at a certain time, and to track changes in land use over time, he said.They should help us to discover whether the giant was created on a grazed chalk hillside, or whether people purposely cleared scrub to prepare the land for the figure.Most of the time, the giant chalk figure is fairly low maintenance with  sheep grazing the site in spring and autumn to keep him trim, but it is seeds deposited in the sheeps’ poo that encourages weed growth within his lines. The weeds are sprayed by chief ranger Michael Clarke and his team but there comes a point where the top layer of chalk has to be replaced.Last year, the giant was refreshed for the first time in 11 years. A team of volunteers, led by Mr Clarke, hammered in 17 tonnes of new chalk from Salisbury by hand to counteract weathering and keep the giant visible for miles around.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 23rd march 2020","story":"A combination picture shows residents toasting during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours during the coronavirus lockdown imposed by the Belgian government in an attempt to slow down the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in the Brussels commune of Anderlecht, BelgiumAll jury trials to be suspended in bid to combat coronavirus, Lord Chief Justice announcesMonday morning news briefing: 24 hours to avoid total lockdownCoronavirus latest news: Harvey Weinstein tests positive in New York prison Comment: We were wrong: this isn’t a war, it’s a plagueFrom Tom Hanks and Harvey Weinstein to Michel Barnier, coronavirus hits celebrities, sports stars and politiciansLondon lockdown: Are shops closed, is the Tube running and can I leave the house? Coronavirus school closures: what does it mean for exams - and which children can still go to school?Can I go for a walk outside?

It took us a day or two, whereas it would have taken months on a normal computer, said Jeremy Smith, Governor\u0027s Chair at the University of Tennessee and the principal researcher in the study.\u0026nbspThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government\u0027s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus -- and where has it spread?Our results don\u0027t mean that we have found a cure or treatment for Covid-19. We are hopeful, though, that our computational findings will both inform future studies and provide a framework that experimentalists will use to further investigate these compounds.\u0026nbspOnly then will we know whether any of them exhibit the characteristics needed to mitigate this virus.On Friday, the global number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 passed 250,000, which have resulted in more than 10,000 deaths.The supercomputer, which is the size of two tennis courts,\u0026nbsphas previously been used in research ranging from Mars landings, to understanding the origins of the universe.Capable of performing over 200 quadrillion calculations per second, IBM\u0027s Summit is described as the Formula One of supercomputers and is 1 million times faster than the most powerful laptop.IBM said Summit would continue to be used for providing ground-breaking technology for the betterment of humankind.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re monitoring those changes carefully to make sure we can respond rapidly if needed. However, the UK’s communications infrastructure is well within its capacity limits and has significant headroom for growth in demand.”​Other industry experts have warned that the measures may not be enough to prevent more outages, with GlobalData director Emma Mohr-McClune calling on other major bandwidth consumers to take similar action.Online video game platforms have already seen huge spikes in users in recent weeks – a trend that is expected to continue as the crisis progresses.\u0026nbspDesktop gaming client Steam broke its all-time record for the highest number of concurrent users over the weekend, seeing over 20 million gamers use the platform at one time.Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem“Although video streaming represents the lion’s share of residential internet traffic in Europe, interactive online gaming is a substantially greater threat in network overload terms.

It looks outwardly near-identical to the current model, but it offers better value, increased storage and faster performance. But even these things are not the game-changer: that’s the new keyboard.The pricing first: where the previous MacBook Air, on sale until just days ago, cost £1,099 and came with 128GB of internal storage, the entry-level Air is now £100 less, £999, and has 256GB of storage. There’s also a 512GB model available, with a faster processor, for £1,299. There are still lots of laptops out there for much less money, but this price represents good value. Note that Apple has education pricing for those in class as students or teachers, so it’s possible to get that price even lower if you qualify.The look is the same as before: sleek and classy. It comes in three colours, silver, space grey and gold. The space grey is the best: solid and businesslike without looking boring, though the gold, warm with a peachy hint to it, is also a head-turner.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe build quality of the MacBook Air is exceptional, an all-aluminium casing that’s sculpted to the slimmest of edges to make it easy to pick up. Like all MacBooks, and unlike many other laptops, you can open it with one hand, the build is so perfectly balanced. Other machines require a finger to hold down the keyboard as you open the lid or the whole thing swings up as it opens.This MacBook Air continues to have a power button with Touch ID built in – a fingerprint scanner that ensures your computer screen locks when you’re away from it and only unlocks to your finger. Apple Watch wearers can also use their smart timepiece to unlock the MacBook Air, which is cool. Both mechanisms feel intimate and secure.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The Air has two Thunderbolt USB-C ports. For other connections, such as USB-A, you’ll need an adaptor. That’s not always convenient, though it gets easier all the time as more accessories switch to USB-C, and it helps to keep the Air thin.The MacBook Air has been preposterously slim and light since it was first unveiled by Steve Jobs in 2008 when the then-CEO slid it out of an envelope to an admiring crowd. It was so much thinner and lighter than the competition that it drew gasps of excitement. Over the next decade it slipped behind, especially in terms of the screen resolution, though that’s been fixed. Now, the 13in display is bright, rich and superbly high-resolution.Apple releases iPad with 3D scanner and a trackpadApple and Netflix pull out of SXSW over coronavirus fearsAnd then there’s the new keyboard. Apple keyboards were traditionally outstanding, using a scissor-switch mechanism, with lots of travel and a great feel. Then, a few years ago, Apple changed to a whole new system, using a butterfly mechanism. The first-generation of this was quite noisy, but this was overcome in subsequent versions. But then, problems arose which led to keyboards being replaced as users complained that there wasn’t the same reliability.Last year, on the MacBook Pro 16in, Apple introduced the Magic Keyboard – a name taken from its desktop wireless keyboard – which changed everything. The new keys were quieter, more stable and had more travel – a full 1mm. That’s not quite as much as the keys moved before the butterfly landed, when it was 1.2mm. But it was enough, and it was a revelation.It’s the same here. Using the new keyboard subtly transforms the typing experience. It’s not that the butterfly keys were bad: unless they failed, they worked well and were comfortable to use.But as soon as you use the new Magic Keyboard, you recognise how comfortable and inviting it is. The downside is it’s quite hard to go back. Having typed this review on the MacBook Air keys, I picked up a previous Air to make a comparison. As soon as I started typing, my fingers told me I was missing the new experience. The keys on the old Air, which I had used happily before, just couldn’t match the luxurious and satisfying feel of the new one. The gentle scoop on the top of each key that helps your fingers find the right place to touch, the crisper inidual backlighting to make typing in a less bright room a breeze and the clearer lettering on each key – all of which are small, subtle improvements that Apple has made with the Magic Keyboard – add up to something big.The processor has been improved on the latest models with a 1.1GHz dual-core Core i3 processor on the £999 model and a 1.1GHz quad-core Core i5 chip on the £1,299 version.In practical terms, this means that the Air is a real performer. Not that it was a slouch before, but it handles tasks easily. It’s true, the MacBook Pro is still the go-to laptop for those doing advanced video processing or running other power-hungry programs. But the Air is now very fast and effective. To the extent that many customers may ask whether they really need to spend £1,299 on the entry-level 13in MacBook Pro rather than a £999 MacBook Air that isn’t that far off. Sure, there are other extras in the Pro range, like the spiffy Touch Bar instead of function keys, and four Thunderbolt USB-C sockets instead of two on the Air, for instance.Battery life on the MacBook Air is exemplary: it just goes on and on all day where other laptops, including some MacBook Pro models, don’t last as long. It’s so good that you may not even think about checking how much charge is left in the battery. It gives a great feeling of peace of mind.The new MacBook Air is available for order now, with deliveries starting next week. It represents a big step forward for the super-slim Apple laptop, combining sumptuous good looks with real performance and, above all, an unbeatably appealing keyboard.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These iniduals will not have a right to live in Britain after the deadline of June 2021, unless they successfully appeal the decision.The number remains proportionately small, as there have been nearly 3 million applications processed overall, but it marks a considerable jump from the previous monthly figures, when just seven people had been refused.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt that point the refusals were all on the grounds of criminality, but most of the latest refusals were due to issues around eligibility –\u0026nbspusually because the applicant has been unable to provide the relevant\u0026nbspdocumentary\u0026nbspevidence.While the number is still proportionately low, campaigners have raised alarm at the sudden increase, and it is likely to prompt concern around difficulties more vulnerable people face when obtaining evidence.Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesEU settlement scheme delays leave people unable to get jobsNine out of 10 EU settlement scheme appeals successful, data showsWithout physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe Home Office said officials had made every attempt to obtain the necessary evidence before refusing applications, and that decisions to refuse were not taken lightly and signed off at a high level.Maike Bohn, co-founder of campaign group\u0026nbspthe3million, told The Independent she was concerned by the fact that while there had been no refusals on eligibility grounds before February 2020, there was now a sharp rise.“This is hard to explain. We urgently need more explanation from the Home Office as to why those cases have been refused,” she said. “It is concerning that as soon as the UK left the EU we see people being refused settled status.”Christopher Desira, immigration solicitor at Seraphus law firm, said there were likely to be more and more refusals beyond criminality grounds, which may worry a lot of people in uncommon family arrangements, which tend to be the most complex applications.\u0026nbspHe also raised alarm over the gaps in free outreach and advice services that are likely to form due to the coronavirus outbreak, which may cause problems for those receiving requests for further information from the Home Office, but not know how to respond, and called on the Home Office to pause any refusals until the emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are our families and friends, our colleagues and carers. They must have the right to stay.\u0026nbspEven before the coronavirus crisis, we were warning that tens of thousands of EU citizens will be left without settled status when the Conservative government’s arbitrary deadline hits next year.“That would leave thousands of people effectively undocumented and at risk of eviction, detention and even deportation. It will be a new Windrush scandal on an even bigger scale.”The Home Office figures show that overall, there have been more than 3.34 million applications to the scheme up to the end of February 2020.Minister for future borders and immigration Kevin Foster said: “EU citizens have made huge contributions to our country.

Our Games are not next week or two weeks from now. They’re four months from now. I think a lot may change in that time period. So we are affording the IOC the opportunity to gather that information and expert advice, and at this point in time we do not feel it’s necessary for us to insist that they make a decision.”USA Swimming is a huge draw when watching the Olympic Games given the level their athletes perform at, with former\u0026nbspswimmers including Michael Phelps, who is the most decorated Olympian of all time. So the organisation speaking out against the continuation of the Games comes as\u0026nbspa huge blow for the IOC while it weighs the difficult decision.Jacob Pebley, a swimmer on the 2016 US Olympic‘s team, released a statement about why the Games should be postponed this year.\u0026nbspTeam USA and role models for hundreds of thousands of young athletes, attend Olympic Trialsthe Olympics in good conscience?” he wrote. “To do so would fly in the face of all emerging evidence and best practices for social distancing and protecting the health of vulnerable communities.”US Gymnastics team has not publicly taken a position on if the Olympics should be postponed this year.\u0026nbspThe British Olympic Association (BOA) recently said it would not “endanger the health” of its athletes by encouraging them to train for the Games if it was not in their best interest to do so.\u0026nbsp“We can be categorically clear that we will not endanger the health and wellbeing of the athletes or wider delegation at any point,” the BOA said.\u0026nbsp“It is imperative to preserve competitive integrity for athletes, but it is clearly only wise for athletes to continue to prepare for the Games where it is safe and appropriate to do so, within relevant Government and public health guidelines.”But the organisation said it\u0026nbspstill respected the IOC and its decision-making process when ultimately deciding if the Games should be postponed or continue.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

in a bid to stop the death toll reaching ,.The Government guidance is that people who are over , have an underlying health condition or are pregnant, are strongly advised to limit social interaction with friends and family, where possible.It is thought to apply to around  million people, including adults under  who qualy for a flu jab due to an underlying health condition and people with chronic long-term respiratory diseases, such as asthma.A further . million people - those with a suppressed immune system, eg. chemo patients - are advised to self-isolate for  weeks, to shield themselves from the bug.Here, we take you through the people who should self-isolate for  weeks - as the coronavirus epidemic spirals...The elderly set to be hit the hardest by the coronavirus pandemic because their immune systems are weaker - meaning their bodies are less able to fight Covid-.Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and Clinical Director of Patient Access, told The Sun: We know that as you get older, your immune system becomes less efficient – that’s why older people are at higher risk of serious complications of coronavirus infection.If your immune system isn’t strong, it’s more likely that the virus can multiply deep inside your lung, causing inflammation and scarring.Your immune system will try and fight it off, and will often destroy healthy lung tissue in the process.This makes you more prone to get ‘secondary’ infections like pneumococcal pneumonia.Pensioners will have to remain in their homes, except for getting medical care, and not go to work, school or public areas.Experts also say people who are self-isolating need to separate themselves from other people in their home and stay in a well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened.If they do not have access to the internet or are not handy with a computer, Age UK recommend that healthy, more active people help with running errands like picking up bits of shopping.The Government is in talks with major retailers to ensure the elderly and vulnerable can still get access to supplies, such as through a telephone hotline where they can place orders.It may be worth ensuring that the older people in your le are set up with online shopping accounts now, are able to access social media to stay in touch with other or have been introduced to streaming services such as Netflix.On top of this, part of the mental battle of isolation is remaining as active as possible - eventhis means standing up ten times in one hour and walking between rooms in the house.If the elderly person you are helping has a garden, encourage them to walk around it - and make sure they are not immobile for long periods of time, watching television for long periods or remaining bed bound.Anyone who visits an older person should wash their hands before and after they visit.Ensure carers in homes or those doing regular home visits do not attendthey are sick or displaying symptoms of coronavirus.The UK government has now classed expectant mothers as those among the vulnerable group of society at risk of Covid-.Professor Chris Whitty, Englands Chief Medical Officer, said that including pregnant women in this group was a precautionary measure as experts are early in our understanding of this virus.And his deputy, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, said its hoped that these new measures will reduce the infection rate and protect those at higher risk.He told the BBC: When it comes to this coronavirus, it is a new disease, its been with humans around the world for just a few months.We are being very precautionary in terms of the advice we are giving to pregnant women to increase their social distancing.We know that a whole range of normal infections are more serious in pregnancy and the advice were giving is extremely precautionary.This way the baby can be monitored using continuous electronic fetal monitoring, and the mums oxygen levels can be monitored hourly.As this can only take place in an obstetric unit, where doctors and midwives are present, it is not currently recommended that you give birth at home or in a midwe led unit, where only midwes would be present.The experts also say that there is no evidence to suggest that you cannot give birth vaginally - or that youd be safer having a c-section.Therefore your birth plan should be followed as closely as possible based on your wishes.However,your respiratory condition suggested that urgent delivery would be needed, a caesarean birth may be recommended.The experts added: There is no evidence that women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus cannot have an epidural or a spinal block.However, the use of gas and air may increase aerosolisation and spread of the virus, so your maternity team will discuss all the options with you in early labour to ensure you are aware of the pain relief options available to you.He added: The early signal, and it is only an early signal, is that the highest risk is only going to be towards the end of the third trimester, so from the th week, that kind of position in the pregnancy.But we are being very precautionary and saying that because we dont know enough about this disease yet.We havent got enough information on the disease in pregnant women, that the best thing to do is take a precautionary approach and advise social distancing and to identy that this is strongly advised for pregnant women as a whole group.According to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , the large majority of women will experience only mild or moderate symptoms.These include a cough, fever and shortness of breath.People with severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis will have to self-isolate for  weeks.This includes people with severe asthma who require hospital admissions or courses of steroid tablets.This is because people with chest conditions are generally more likely to pick up infections, and are more vulnerable to complicationsthey do develop an infection such as coronavirus.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Professor Kevin Southern, from the UKs Cystic Fibrosis Trust Medical Association, said: It is important to continue to pursue a fit and healthy lestyle and to be up to date with immunisations, including ‘flu’, even though this is a dferent virus.If a person with CF develops cold or ‘flu-like symptoms , speak with your CF team about starting a recommended back-up antibiotic treatment.People with cancer are among those at higher risk of complications from Covid- - because cancer and treatment can weaken their immune systems.The immune system protects the body against illness and infection caused by viruses like coronavirus.Some people with cancer have a weak immune system which reduces their ability to fight these infections.This is because some treatments, like chemotherapy, can stop the bone marrow from making enough white blood cells, which are part of your immune system.This is most likely to happen during a course of cancer treatment, but the effects can last for some time afterwards.Some types of cancer can also lower your ability to fight infection. This is usually cancer that affects your immune system like leukaemia or lymphoma.When your ability to fight infection is lowered the symptoms of any infection can be much more severe and may become dangerous.Cancer Research UK urge those with the disease to talk to your cancer team and follow NHS advice.Primary immunodeficiencies are disorders in which part of the bodys immune system is missing or does notnormally.This leaves them with reduced or no natural defence against germs such as bacteria, fungi and viruses - and that is likely to be true with Covid-.Susan Walsh from the PID UK said they were advising people to follow Public Health England guidelines.She told : We are also telling people thatthey do feel ill they should contact a doctor promptly with details of their diagnosis, medication and immunology centre.It’s a balance between raising awareness, but not creating great fear. It needs to be handled very carefully.Someone with a severe disease of a body system is more likely to have a less robust immune system - meaning their bodys response is not as strong a response when exposed to viruses.In particular, based on early reports,  per cent of hospitalised Covid- patients had cardiovascular disease.The bugs main target is the lungs but that could affect the heart, especially a diseased heart, which has to work harder to get oxygenated blood throughout the body.That could exacerbate problems for someone with heart failure, where the heart is already having problems pumping efficiently.Similarly, those with severe kidney diseaseshould also be particularly cautious and self-isolate.Kidney Care UK says those having dialysis will still get dialysis sessions they just may be asked to come in at a dferent time and some people may be asked to do two sessions a week rather than three, provided it is considered to be safe for you do so.Public Health England say those with clinical conditions that put them at a high risk of severe illness from Covid- will be contacted by NHS England next week.They will be told the stringent measures they need to take in order to keep themselves and others safe.For now, they should rigorously follow the social distancing advice from the government in full.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

except to those of key workers and vulnerable kids.Here is the official list of key workers critical to the Covid- response and what it means for you and your family.Key workers whose children will be allowed back to school as they play a crucial role in Britains fight against coronavirus have been named by the Government.The working heroes include nurses, police officers and delivery drivers and their children will be exempt from the decision to close classrooms from Monday to stop the spread of the deadly bug.Full government guidelines here.In a live broadcast, Johnson  announced that schools across the whole of the UK will be closed after todayas Britain desperately tries to contain the coronavirus outbreak at the right time.Mr Williamson promised that free school meals will continue for everyone who needs it - likely in the form of supermarket vouchers.Boris told the nation on Thursday evening that the spread was slowing as a result of the draconian measures he put in place this week.The PM explained: We believe the steps we have already taken, together with those I am announcing today, are already slowing the spread of the disease.Mr Williamson told the BBC earlier: It will include all those people working within the NHS.We talk about doctors and nurses but there are so many more people who make sure a hospital is able to run and .All of those people will be included.There will also be the the need for those who work within schools, those who are providing the support in order for doctors and nurses, and those NHS staff to be able to get to those hospitals.More widely, we still need to have our critical infrastructure that continues to work and .This is how the government defines the groups of key workers:This includes but is not limited to doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics, social workers, care workers, and other frontline health and social care staff including volunteers the support and specialist staff required to maintain the UK’s health and social care sector those working as part of the health and social care supply chain, including producers and distributers of medicines and medical and personal protective equipment.This includes nursery and teaching staff, social workers and those specialist education professionals who must remain active during the COVID- response to deliver this approach.This includes those essential to the running of the justice system, religious staff, charities and workers delivering key frontline services, those responsible for the management of the deceased, and journalists and broadcasters who are providing public service broadcasting.This only includes those administrative occupations essential to the effective delivery of the COVID- response or delivering essential public services such as the payment of benefits, including in government agencies and armsbodies.This includes those involved in food production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery as well as those essential to the provision of other key goods .This includes police and support staff, Ministry of Defence civilians, contractor and armed forces personnel , fire and rescue service employees , National Crime Agency staff, those maintaining border security, prison and probation staff and other national security roles, including those overseas.This includes those who will keep the air, water, road and rail passenger and freight transport modes operating during the COVID- response, including those working on transport systems through which supply chains pass.This includes staff needed for essential financial services provision , the oil, gas, electricity and water sectors , information technology and data infrastructure sector and primary industry supplies to continue during the COVID- response, as well as key staff working in the civil nuclear, chemicals, telecommunications , postal services and delivery, payments providers and waste disposal sectors.If you believe your job falls into one of the key worker categories outlined by the government you must first confirm this with your employer.If your school is closed then youll have to contact your local authority who will try to allocate your child a place at another local school in your area.The government is encouraging all registered childcare providers, schools and colleges to remain open over the Easter holidays to care for the children of key workers.More detail and answers to specic questions can be found on the government website here.Although most are grateful for the school closures, ensuring that their children has a less risk of catching coronavirus, there are many parents worried how they will be able to feed their kids.Normally, children in low-income families are on the Free Schools Meals scheme.Yet, have no fear as Education Secretary Gavin Williamson revealed that these families will be put on a national voucher system, whereby they will receive free coupons with monetary value to cover the loss of school meals - and can spend them how they like.Williamson said that schools will be closed until further notice - but would be at least five weeks, taking us until April  at the earliest.The closure comes just two weeks before the Easter break when they would have had a fortnight off.But this break could last until after the six-week summer holidays and restart in September."},{"url":null,"title":"defeat coronavirus nation play part","story":"We all need rapidly to get a grip.The Government’s advice, backed by its scientists, has been clear enough: Avoid pubs and restaurants, where the virus can so easily spread.Stop the brainless panic-buying and hoarding which strips shelves of essentials ALL of us need — especially OAPs, exhausted NHS workers and the low-paid.Yet some pubs remain packed, notably in London where two-thirds of the latest deaths occurred.Some young people think a pint is worth the risk.Old folk reckon Britain saw off the Nazis, so they won’t be cowed by a microscopic bug.We can understand it . . . but both attitudes are delusional and irresponsible.It won’t just be their problemthey catch Covid-.They could infect an old or sick person, who dies.And the NHS will have to cope with all of it.People must stay at home.And though The Sun has always been a friend to our pubs, Boris Johnson must ignore his liberal instincts and shut themneed be.Supermarkets, meanwhile, insist the food supply is perfectly adequate IF people shop sensibly and considerately.But queues snake around the block at dawn.Selfish shoppers buy enough loo roll, pasta and medicine for months.It is insane, unnecessary and must stop.

This is a time for unity and for respecting others, especially the most vulnerable.As the Queen put it yesterday in her admirable statement: “I am reminded that our nation’s history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal.”As the emergency deepens, abuse of privilege should play no part in our national response.But that is exactly what is now happening, as is graphically demonstrated by the saga of private Covid- tests kits.One of the biggest problems the Government faces is the shortage of capacity for testing.To prevent the current system from being overwhelmed by demand, NHS policy is only to test people with a “high chance” of having the illness, such as those who have ed from high-risk countries or are displaying symptoms.Even doctors and nurses working in the front-line are not routinely tested.But to evade such official restrictions, a growing number of the rich and famous are forking out for private coronavirus kits, which can cost anything between £ and £.According to one report this week, more than , wealthy figures in Britain have ordered such kits.Dr Mark Ali, director of the Harley Street clinic, said: “We have private iniduals – some recognisable names there – and we are testing lords and ladies and even doctors and dentists who are worried about catching the disease.”It is the same story of privileged access in the US, where, just as in Britain, shortages of supplies mean that many health care workers and sick people are unable to get diagnoses.But some stars seek to bypass rules that limit tests to those most at risk.A huge controversy erupted this week at the news that eight top NBA basketball teams has been tested, making a mockery of the rationing.Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, spoke for much of the public when he said that “an entire NBA team should not get tested for Covid- while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested. Tests should not be for the wealth, but for the sick.”On both sides of the Atlantic, this two-tiered approach is wrong on so many levels.It is a deep insult to healthcare workers. It is profoundly isive.And it does not lessen the burdens on the NHS here in Britain, as some apologists pretend.Those who test positive will still have to be treated in the health service, since the British private medical sector does not have the resources for this crisis.Selfish and irresponsible, the Covid-test queue jumpers are the equivalents of the supermarket stockpilers or the social distancing refuseniks who still insist on going down to the pub.During the Second World War, when the Blitz spirit was at its peak, there was fierce hostility to rich iniduals who tried to cheat on rationing regulations or avoid national service.The same contempt should now be shown to those who try to dodge the rules that promote fairness.But it is not just in testing where the narrow self-centredness of the rich can be found. They use their wealth to insulate themselves in other ways.Some are buying special private medical care, like intravenous infusions of vitamins and minerals to boost their immune system.Lansherhof, a private medical facility at the London Arts Club, reported this week an  per cent increase in enquires for its Immune Plus Support Infusion, which costs £.The rich are also using private jet travel to avoid the rest of the public as they conduct business or fly to remote havens.Inquiries for international flights by private jets are estimated to be up nine-fold since the outbreak began, while Hong Kong International Airport reported this week its busiest day for private jet activity.Nor do the rich have to endure the normal airport ordeal suffered by other passengers.A spokeswoman for Quintessentially, a concierge company for millionaires, said: “Members who are travelling commercially are choosing to book elite services at airports, not your typical first-class lounge.For example, private terminals where guests are greeted and given their own suite.Check-in, customs and security are all done privately and guests are taken to the doors of the aircraft.Members can request for the jetty to be cleared so they minimise the interactions with other passengers”.Most Brits have no choice over where they live in the midst of this crisis.But that is not true of the wealthy who can find sanctuary in one of their many properties or rent out an expensive rural bolt-hole.Some are now paying £,-a-month for a luxury base in the Cotswolds.Nor does self-isolation have to be the imprisoning experience that it is for ordinary citizens.The rich can bring in private chefs for their dinners, or expensive tutors for their children.The company Tutors International, which provides elite tuition services, says it has seen “a massive upswing in requests” since the outbreak began.The elite even have luxury face masks. The fashionable Airinum Urban Air Mask costs £ and claims to protect “against airborne particles as small as .mm.”But in this rarefied world, problems are faced by the elite that would never be considered by others.Wailing that she now has now chance to show off her expensive jewellery, one female financier in London says: “I’m just not sure when my next ball will be.”The experience of the affluent is in dramatic contrast to the misery faced by people at the other end of the scale.While the rich cocoon themselves, it is the wage-earners, the straitened households, the poor and the unemployed who are now in the eye of the storm.Our society is just beginning to realize the terrying consequences of this disaster, where the mounting death toll is matched by economic meltdown.Vast numbers of people – from hotel cleaners to airline cabin crew, from bar staff to retail assistants – are going to lose their jobs.The ranks of the five million self-employed will be decimated. Small businesses across the country will collapse.Food banks are already running short of supplies, while the plight of the homeless – who cannot isolate themselves on the streets – is desperate as shelters close.At worst, our prosperous civilisation could slide into a kind of modern feudal structure, with only the aristocracy at the top enjoying a decent standard of living.At a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, President Trump was asked whether “the well-connected go to the front of the line”.He replied philosophically: “You’d have to ask them that. Perhaps that’s been the story of le.”But it should not be that way, especially when mankind is facing one of its darkest hours.We should all be in this together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We can focus on fear, on ourselves and what we cannot do.Or we can turn to God and let God lead us into praying for the world, and let prayer flow into us, taking creative and loving action.Thats what we want to do today, to remind ourselves that le carries on and that there is much to celebrate in our communities.The Church of England and Church of Scotland banned mass worship this week as the Government called for an end to mass gatherings.Catholic churches adopted a similar approach to encourage people to maintain social distance to slow the spread of the virus.The Reverend David Meakin, of Aylesbury, said the church was having to work out an entirely new way of doing things.He said: The Second World War didnt shut the churches, but this has, so were in day three of trying to work out what were going to do.Stick a laptop somewhere and you can broadcast on Facebook within seconds, its very straightforward, evenit wont be high quality.I think some will value it - frankly, evena few access it, its still worth doing.But vicar Simon Beach, , accidentally set fire to his arm with a church candle as he got to grips with his virtual service in Plymouth.Mr Beach, vicar of St Budeaux Parish Church in Plymouth, was not harmed during the mishap and posted the out-take online.In the video, Mr Beach is seen leaning in to deliver the final part of his sermon before exclaiming calmly: Oh dear, Ive just caught fire.Funeral directors are also beginning to offer families free live streams of their loved ones cremations.Martin Rowley, who runs Rowley  Sons, in York, is offering to pay the £ fee which York Crematorium usually charges for services to be broadcast online.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

bottles of unwanted Chardonnay.Jonny Farley, , uses a pot still to extract alcohol from the wine, other cheap plonks and spirits before adding aloe vera and bottling it.The self-styled booze-making “dabbler” then checks to ensure he has the right concentration to protect against coronavirus.Jonny, from Bannockburn, Stirlingshire, is now dishing out his concoction to family, friends and those struggling to find sanitiser in supermarkets and online.The bug-busting hero said: “My we Audrey was going to the shop last week and askedthere was anything I needed.When I said pick up a couple of bottles of hand sanitiser she just laughed and said ‘there’s no chance, nobody has any’.“I just thought ‘OK, I will make it myself’.“I bought a pot still some time ago and I’ve messed around making my own cherry brandies to take to the rugby and things.“To make hand sanitisers, all I needed was a ready source of alcohol — and I’ve got lots of bottles of wine.“The wines I’m using I call ‘tombola wine’ — the bottles that I’ve won in raffles or that people have given me but are not the wines I drink.“I’ve thrown in bottles of rose, Chardonnay, some cheap reds as well as some spirits and even bottles of mouthwash, which also have alcohol in them.“Add some aloe vera gels and you have a perfectly good hand sanitiser gel.”Jonny, who works as a bespoke tailor, has a science background and makes booze including craft gin because he is fascinated by the distilling process.To produce his hand sanitiser, he pours around three litres of wine and mouthwash through the still once to get a spirit which is around  per cent proof.He repeats the process twice until he has around half a litre of clear spirit containing up to  per cent alcohol, then mixes it with an aloe vera gel before bottling it.He fills pump dispensers for hand gels and atomisers for a spray version he has created to use on objects around the home.The gel has a pleasant aroma due to the tipples plonked in during production.Friends, family and work colleagues are now using it, but Jonny has also given some away to people in need.One batch was given to a mum desperate to get sanitiser for her autistic child who hates the sensation of water, which makes hand-washing dficult.He said: “The Government advice is bang on —you can you should wash your hands with soap and hot water.“Butyou’re constantly on the go you don’t always have a chance, which is where the hand gels come in.“It’s the alcohol content that kills the bacteria and the finished gel is about  per cent alcohol, once I’ve added aloe vera. I have an alcohol meter that tells me exactly what the alcohol content is.“The aloe vera acts as a moisturiser and the smell is very pleasant too because it’s made of so many dferent wines, spirits and mouthwash.”Jonny insisted he is delighted to help out amid the ongoing crisis which has seen shops run dry and prices soar online.He added: “In a normal situation you could buy hand sanitiser a lot cheaper than it costs me to make it.“But with none in the shops and people online charging fortunes, it’s a solution.  I can make as much as I need and not have to worry about running out.”Meanwhile, booze courier firm Drinkly is offering free daytime delivery on all convenience goods such as toilet roll, paracetamol and hand wash to residents across Edinburgh and West Lothian.The online marketplace connects customers to convenience stores in their area, enabling them to shop online with a guaranteed delivery slot in under one hour.Founder John Robertson said he was glad to play his part as residents self-isolate and follow social distancing guidelines.He said: “Modern technology is absolutely critical to the way we go about our lives as this crisis escalates, whether it’s accessing virtual office systems, taking part in live online exercise classes, or simply buying what we need to keep our households running as smoothly as possible, without leaving our homes.“There will be many people who don’t have a network of friends or family nearby that they can call upon to help with things like grocery shopping.“Equally there will be others home alone during the day who can’t venture out to pick up something urgent, so we hope that we’re relieving a little bit of the pressure by offering free daytime deliveries.”To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Business groups and unions have urged the Chancellor to do more to help Britain’s freelancers, contractors, self-employed and creatives – who were offered just £ a week. Mr Sunak confirmed plans last week for at-risk employees to have up to % of their wages paid, up to a maximum of £, a month. He is now “actively considering” ways to plug the gaps in the support package amid claims he had “left behind” the self-employed. British Chamber of Commerce director general Dr Adam Marshall warned that thousands of sole traders need immediate help to survive as their livelihoods “vanish”. He said: “The government has taken massive steps to help businesses. Ministers must now ramp up support for the self-employed, many of whom have seen their livelihoods vanish in the blink of an eye. “There are five million people who need help similar in scale and scope to that put in place for larger firms.” TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The government took a big and important step last week with support for employed workers. It’s only right that they quickly follow this with a similar level of support for the self-employed.” CBI director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn added: “The £ is not enough for the self-employed to live on and I know the government, with business, are working to find a solution.” A Populus survey last week found almost half of the self-employed felt they would have to work eventhey had Covid-. It underlines the fears of unions and industry bodies who believe self-employed or gig economy workers would just carry on. Whitehall officials believe a universal basic income would be dficult to implement and that quicker solutions are needed. They are thought to be considering a Norway-style approach, where self-employed workers will get grants of % of their average income of the past three years.  Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has signalled that the Treasury is considering further measures. He told the BBC yesterday: “We appreciate this isn’t perfect and the Chancellor is going to keep reviewing the situation. It’s not as simple as supporting those in employment. “The purpose of our employment mechanism is to help continue the connection between employees and their business so, once this is over, those iniduals canto their usual work. It is operationally very dficult to create a scheme akin to that for the self-employed.” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the self-employed were a “major omission” from the plans.Leadership favourite Keir Starmer, who has called for statutory sick pay to be tripled, said: “Ministers are several steps behind. Countries such as Denmark have shown what actions government can take to protect people’s incomes.” United Private Hire Drivers, which represents minicab drivers, said drivers “face the abyss” without help.  Pamela Morton, of the National Union of Journalists, said members are “seeing work dry up and face suffering real hardship”. More than , musicians have written to the Chancellor saying there had been “complete shutdown of our places of work”.The musicians, led by Ed Barker, a former saxophonist for George Michael, said: “We are simply asking for fair and equal treatment, and for the coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to be extended to the self-employed.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus fresh air doesnt provide","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Fresh air doesnt provide immunity, says Boris Johnson as Brits hit parksThousands of Brits flocked to the beach to soak up the sunny weather this weekend, with the Prime Minister now urging people to keep at least two metres apart in publicShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video fresh-air-does-not-provide-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics coronavirus-fresh-air-doesnt-provide-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak finally grasped that tens of billions must be spent protecting wages and livelihoods to save jobs and businesses. And that move is a repudiation of Torynomics. Yet victory will be temporaryCovid- in  is followed by choking austerity that strangled a stronger recovery after the  global banking collapse. Labour Left-winger John McDonnell’s pointed quip that the Tories are now also Marxists underlines the hollowness of Boris Johnson’s election claims that Labour would bankrupt the UK. Sunak being forced to borrow more than Gordon Brown in the financial crisis, and debt spiralling above £trillion, is as necessary as it was a dozen years ago. With % knocked off the FTSE- and unemployment poised to soar, Brown and TUC chief Frances O’Grady were on the side of the angels. The fear is Johnson and Sunak will repeat the mistakes of David Cameron and George Osborne – who wrongly blamed rising deficits  years ago on spending on nurses, teachers and the poor to justy self-defeating Tory squeezes on pay and services. History repeats itself first as tragedy then as farce, as McDonnell, the vindicated Marxist, reminded me in the recent past. Johnson has conveniently embraced the public intervention and regulation he ideologically decries but it isn’t his get-out-of-jail-free card. Labour’s likely next leader Keir Starmer must pin Johnson’s fatal errors on him.

The governmentaposs chief scientic advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, and Prof Chris Whitty, Boris Johnsonaposs chief medical advisor, sought to reassure the public on Monday, thereported. They said those who have had the virus once will develop some immunity. It was rare to get an infectious disease again, they said. The questions first arose last month, after Japanese authorities said a woman who had had the virus, and been declared virus-free, had tested positive again. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email  webnews@mirror Scientists were left confused by the news and and also uneasy. Prof Mark Harris, an expert in virology at Leeds University, said reinfection in that case was “unlikely”, but added that “there is some evidence in the scientic literature for persistent infections of animal coronaviruses ”. When Vallance was asked on Mondaythe Japanese case meant herd immunity was no longer achievable, he replied that some people do catch infectious diseases a second time, but that it is a rare occurrence. There was no evidence to suggest that it would occur with the coronavirus, he added. Prof Whitty explained that with diseases, eventhere is no long-term immunity, there is normally some short-term immunity. Prof Jon Cohen, emeritus professor of infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, said: “The answer is that we simply don’t know [about reinfection] yet because we don’t have an antibody test for the infection, although we will have soon.

The teenager was among  deaths in England, all in vulnerable groups including people with underlying health conditions. Yet as the UK’s death toll hit  and confirmed cases topped ,, sunseekers crowded popular spots despite terrying warnings of the consequences to society’s most vulnerable and an already struggling NHS. Police bosses had to warn people to stay away from beauty spots such as the Lake District, telling them: “This is not a holiday.” Boris Johnson threatened to shut parks and impose a curfewpeople fail to follow social distancing advice. The Prime Minister said: “If people don’t do that, then yes of course we’re going to have to bring in tougher measures.”He added: “We’ll think about this very actively in the next  hours. We need to think about the kind of measures we’ve seen where – other countries that have been forced to bring in restrictions on people’s movements altogether.” Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick warned: “We don’t want to go down that route. But this isn’t a game this is very serious.” Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries slammed the “dangerous” crowds filling public spaces and making outside environments “unavailable” to others, particularly the vulnerable who need to get fresh air as they self-isolate. Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said “le should not feel normal” now, andit did, you should ask “ you are doing the right things”. As crowds packed the Lake District over the weekend, Cumbria Assistant Chief Constable Andrew Slattery said: “A national emergency shutdown of businesses and schools is not an excuse for a holiday.” Tourists were also slammed for crowding into the North Yorkshire seaside town of Whitby.  Resident Lucy Whelan said: “They’ve queued for fish and chips, gone to the arcades and filled the car parks. And they should have stayed at home. Our incredible NHS are putting their lives at risk for us and yet some people are treating this as a holiday. They need to wake up – fast.” One of Britain’s biggest holiday companies, Parkdean Resorts, closed its  caravan and lodge parks today. The National Trust has also closed its parks, Cornwall’s Eden Project has closed and the Royal Horticultural Society has shut its gardens.  Lincolnshire’s Police and Crime Commissioner begged visitors to stay away from Skegness, following reports that the seaside resort was “packed” on Saturday.The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warned people across the country that although the spread of the virus was further advanced in the capital, “this is coming to you”. Stores across the High Street are closing down as the pandemic worsens. John Lewis is closing  stores and Debenhams is set to follow. Primark closed its stores until further notice. Pret A Manger, Starbucks and Harrods, are all also temporarily closing. But supermarkets remained packed, with selfish panic-buyers crashing shopping hours reserved for NHS workers. Footage showed hundreds of people at a Tesco in Dudley, West Mids, which opened at am for NHS staff only. Witnesses said shoppers were fighting, with a crush at the door.  A Tesco in Cambridgeshire had to shut after selfish shoppers invaded the NHS staff hour. A family at Tesco Extra in Gallions Reach, East London, rammed their trollies into the barriers in a bid to join the NHS shopping hour. And huge queues were seen at the Lidl at Balby in Doncaster, South Yorks. Bosses pleaded for an end to panic-buying. Tesco boss Dave Lewis urged shoppers to ask themselves: “Do I need everything in my trolley ” Co-operative boss Steve Murrells said: “People need to remain calm.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus much loved primary school","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Much-loved primary school headteacher dies just days after diagnosisRoose Primary School, in Cumbria, is mourning the \"huge loss\" of pioneering headteacher Wendy Jacobs who passed away in Furness General Hospital just days after being diagnosed with Covid-ShareCommentsByRuth OvensRyan Merrield:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-numbers-uk-deaths-rise-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-much-loved-primary-school-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email The Prime Minister has warned people to be responsible when going outside and to shield the vulnerable people in their lives from the coronavirus. Speaking in a press conference this afternoon, Boris Johnson explained how people should act to slow the spread of the disease.Before outlining how the most vulnerable should be protected, the Prime Minister gave guidance about going outdoors on a sunny Sunday on which large groups congregated in parks across the country. Mr Johnson said that the ability to go outdoors for exercise was extremely important for physical and mental wellbeing but that people needed to do it responsibly. Parks and other green spaces would not be closed he said, but people needed to practice social distancing even when out in the fresh air. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email  webnews@mirror People should stay away from large crowds of people and keep two metres from people where possible. Many many people do not have access, letaposs face it, to private green spaces where they can do that and thataposs why parks, open spaces are so absolutely crucial for our country and for our society, he said. But when we do that we have to do that responsibly... my message is youaposve got to do this in line with the advice, youaposve got to follow the social distancing rule - keep two metres apart. Otherwiseyou donapost do it responsibly... as you suggest there is going to be no doubt that we will have to bring forward further measures and we are certainly keeping that under constant review. Keeping Britainaposs parks and green spaces open had more health benefits than locking their gates, he suggested.  Mr Johnson said: The health benefits for the whole of society of keeping the parks and playgrounds open... outweigh the epidemiological value of closing them. Dr Jennie Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said the public had a responsibility to make outside spaces safer by not congregating. There is a real balance point here - what we donapost want to find is that we grow mental health problems or we grow other physical problems because of such a strict imposition, she said. The virus doesnapost last well outside for all sorts of reasons around temperature, UV light and everything  so actually an outdoor environment compared with an indoor one is generally a safer one - but the dficulty ispeople are congregating outside or coming together. A reasonably fit  year old who has been cooped up because heaposs safely isolating at home for a number of nights and wants to go outside for a bit of fresh air, and does so at a distance of two metres from somebody , will no doubt boost his mental health and heaposll no doubt feel able to tuck himself away perhaps for the next  and a half hours quite safely.  Dr Harries added people who were congregating were dangerous and making outside environments unavailable to others. The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Robert Jenrick, went on to explain how people should protect the most ill and vulnerable in their lives. Those who are classied as extremely vulnerable, which may include young people with serious health problems, will receive a letter of advice from the NHS before March . They are strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact for a period of at least  weeks from the day they receive the letter. Essential support staff, such as carers, have been told they can continue visiting those most at risk until they begin to show symptoms. All people who come into the homes of those most at risk must wash their hands for at least  seconds when they arrive, and then again at regular intervals.  The extremely vulnerable should also avoid gatherings, but should keep in touch with their loved ones via technological means. Mr Jenrick said: aposaposI donapost underestimate what weaposre asking of people. It will be tough. aposaposButyou are one of these people I want to assure these people on behalf of the Government that you are not alone.aposapos Mr Jenrick said the Government was creating a network of local hubs to deliver medicines by pharmacists to the most vulnerable and lonely people. Groceries would be delivered by councils workers. People who are not at risk themselves but live with someone who is should minimise the time they spend with them while trying to keep two metres away. Separate sleeping arrangements should be madepossible and toilets and bathrooms should be cleaned between uses.  Meals should be eaten in dferent rooms, with dishwashers the ideal way to clean crockery and cutlery after meals. The government also recommends everyone follows these basic principles of good hygiene: Wash your hands more often - with soap and water for at least  seconds or use a hand sanitiser. Do this after you blow your nose, sneeze or cough, and after you eat or handle food  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands  Avoid close contact with people who have symptoms  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in a bin  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in the home"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle celebrates first uk","story":"NewsMeghan Markle celebrates first UK Mothers Day with Archie and shares sweet messageA simple Instagram post from the Sussex Royal Instagram account says \"Mummy.

And with some reports suggesting temperatures could reach C in the near future, bookmakers have been slashing the odds on spring being the hottest ever. Weather maps show air blowing from Portugal to Britain while the Met Office has confirmed highs climbing from C to C - C above average for some - by Wednesday across the UK.  Newcastle, York and Newtown are just some of the places expected to see the warmest temperatures. Weeks of floods and subzero cold snaps could soon be over, with the good sunshine forecast ahead of the clocks going forward to give an extra hour of evening sunlight from the weekend. The Met Office forecasts mostly dry conditions for  days, going some way to cheering the country as it stays home and enjoys time in the garden.  The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: Sunshine will help boost the mood, with an extended period of settled and dry conditions after recent monthsapos widespread flooding. Ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending said: We will tap into air from further south in Europe through the early part of the week, with daytime temperatures rising. Drier continental winds are now blowing across the UK. The apostapsapos have been turned off after wet and windy westerlies plagued us through winter.

Louise Katz, , believes she and her husband Stephen, , contracted Covid- on holiday in Italy last month. The psychology teacher and doctoral researcher at Derby University had gone with her husband to the Venice Carnival on February  for four days. It was not until later it was announced that Italy had become a hotspot for the virus. Now fully recovered from coronavirus, but still self-isolating at her home in Watford, Herts, she said the couple did “every stupid thing imaginable” after they phoned  the first time.  Louise said: “We didn’t have symptoms until a week after we ed. I had a sore throat, but nothing major so I wasn’t taking any medication. “The aches started a day or two afterwards and it really hurt. It was in my hands and arms and feet - my calves were horrendous. “It came out dferently with my husband. He was sweating, he had the sore throat but he didn’t have the aches. “I spoke to  and they said we couldn’t have it because it wasn’t in their guidelines of travel to Italy at the time. They just told us to carry on as normal so we did. “I was taking paracetamol, which did help. Thankfully I didn’t take Nurofen which is usually my go to. “I was putting it down to the way I sit in my home office or because I trudge through mud for two hours when I walk the dogs in the morning, so I went out and got a massage.  “My husband was still having symptoms and had to go away on business to New Orleans.  said to carry on so we did! “In hindsight, everything we did was stupid.” Louise said her fever, which went as high as  celsius , came and went intermittently. Louise added: “ needs to change. It’s too rigid in its approach, especially as I’ve read the virus affects people in dferent ways. “I want to know whether we’re going to be tested to prove we’ve had it  Are we going to have to prove we have the antibodies to be allowed out in society  “There are going to be millions of us who believe we’ve had it but don’t know for certain. If everyone’s having similar symptoms, it’s likely we have. “It really wipes you out. It’s not like a cold or a flu where you bounce back quickly. My husband is working from home and he’s still falling asleep at pm on the sofa.” Louise said she believes that people are being whipped up in a “frenzy” over an illness that will likely not kill youyou do not fit into a high risk group. She said: “It’s not pleasant, but you can survive it. We know who the high risk groups are and they need to be kept safe. “But why is everyone  being thrown into a panic  We’re not all going to die of this. We’ll have a few weeks of feeling crap and then we’ll be OK. “I’m concerned about people being isolated at home. Psychologically, it could be very damagingit carries on for a long time.

This isnapost time to go out and have play dates, or go to  Walmart, or go out to eat. Stay home people please!apos Doster posted on Facebook. Doster was now worried about her other two children, aged two and four. By Wednesday, Doster said her son was feeling much better. aposI did notice tonight he was easily windedhe jumped too much or played a little hard. You could tell he didnapost feel as well right before bed! But he has been fever free without meds since around pm yesterday!apos Doster continued.

After her own mother was unknowingly a carrier, Doster urged others to think about how they could be harming strangers or someone they love.  aposThis is my PSA! Please take heed to these warnings. Stay inside. Donapost go out to eat or to the park or to the bars. As much as it sucks to be at home, remember this.....ITaposS NOT ABOUT JUST YOU! she wrote. Stay home for your elderly parents or grandparents, or your immunocompromised sister, the newborn baby next door! aposThe more we stay home, wash our hands, and listen to the president or our governors, the CDC, etc the quicker this will be over and we can get back to somewhat normal lives. This virus is putting healthy, young,  something year olds in the ICU! More and more children and infants will contract this virus. And more and more will need to be in the ICU on ventilation. aposI have also experienced my oldest at just  years old hooked up to a ventilator from an extremely high fever that caused a complex febrile seizure. That was the scariest day in my le. I want to never experience it again and I donapost want any other mamas to have to!

I was not going to share my story, but now that I see others are reporting very dferent symptoms than mine I feel it’s important to tell everyone my experience, she wrote. Julia went on to tweet a timeline of her illness, in diary-form. February th: I woke up this day in agony, her first post read. My head was pounding, my ears throbbing, and it felt asmy throat was on fire. My body ached, I had chills, and I had a fever of .. I took over the counter anti-inflammatories and stayed in bed the entire day.  The next tweet jumped forward to Juliaaposs last day in Italy, on March rd. I still couldn’t hear, and at this point I lost all ability to taste and smell, yet I did not have a runny nose or cough, it read. I had a headache constantly during the day which I just treated with Tylenol. I left the next morning toto America. She described March th as the day that scared her to look back on. I flew home, and not a single person asked where I had been. Not even at customs. They didn’t blink an eye at me. I had layovers in LARGE cities. Again, there was no doubt in my mind that I didn’t have the virus. March th-th: As we were told, I stayed in self quarantine during these days, the next tweet read. I had contact with only two people. No symptoms were present that the CDC warned us about. I had a WET cough. And my hearing, taste, and smell finally ed. On Friday  March, Julia got tested for the virus. This was not her plan, she explained, but rather the consequence of having family members working in the health sector, who wanted her to be sure she was well before ing to work. She had to ask repeatedly to be tested, according to her tweets. Julia said she got a call on March , informing her she had tested positive for Covid-. My jaw DROPPED, she recalled.  How was I positive  I didn’t have the symptoms on the news, I got cleared by a doctor, and no one cared. ..at customs I had come from a high risk country. I guess why I’m telling you all of this is because what they are telling you are symptoms are not ALL symptoms. And you do NOT have to have the symptoms to be positive. The only symptom I had that was similar was a fever. Julia said she didnapost know how she had been infected.

He fainted during the assessment and was rushed to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. From the moment I got there I was kept in an isolated room by myself, they definitely didn’t know what to do, Tarek wrote. They ran some tests on me every four hours, with no information or telling me what I have or what’s wrong with me, I was shaking and felt like I was dying with only IVs in my arm. After they took some blood and swabbed my nose for a covid- test I waited again until am in the morning. I got discharged and sent home after  hours in the ER and instructed to only take Tylenol. Tarek, who has designed costumes for Ru Paulaposs Drag Race, was critical of the level of care he received.  The hospitals and USA is completely unprepared for this, he said. I don’t recommend relying on hospitals or the healthcare system. After four days I got my test result back that I am positive. I still have the same symptoms with no progress, but I started developing pneumonia and can’t breathe normally because there is no cure. It was followed by coughing blood. Now I have no fever but I still can’t breath normally, apparently the virus has spread into my lungs.

We’re all in the same situation.“I’ve been nipping to my mum’s and using the gym to keep me occupied but I know I can’t keep doing that.“It’s the best job in the world being a footballer and when you’re not able to do it, it’s rubbish.“However, you have to realise there is a bigger picture. It’s easy to look from a selfish point of view and moan but there is a bigger issue of people’s safety and their health.”He added: “I get cabin fever at the best of times, never mind with this situation.“Anyone who knows me has been saying ‘you’ll go off your head in the house’, I always need to be doing stuff. I’ve been pottering around the house but I struggle to sit around.“I’m already missing going into Dens and seeing everyone, there’s always plenty of banter. I’d usually get a bit off Gowser so it’ll good to get a rest from him!“You think about these things but at the back of the mind you are always aware there are more important things than football, it’s about keeping things in perspective.“That might be good for me in the long-term, I would always have a bad game in my head and people would say ‘there are more important things than football’ and I can definitely see that now.”Training has been cancelled all week at Dens Park and, with no indication from the authorities of when it will be safe to restart playing, Kerr and his team-mates have had to find ways to fill their time away from the football pitch.For a young man like Kerr who is dedicated to his job and keeping himself in the best shape possible for his boyhood club, that’s not been easy and he knows it will get harder over the coming weeks as everyone gets to grips to such a massive change to normal le.The -year-old added: “My usual routine is to head to Dens early doors about am, recently I’ve been doing a bit with the physio Gerry Docherty after the problem with my knee, and start training at am till lunchtime.“Then it’s gym in the afternoon and home before maybe heading to the pool or sauna in the evening. Changing that for me has been dficult.“Since we’ve been off I’ve been getting a longer lie and going to meet up with some people.“Fin Robertson is one of the local boys so we’ve gone for coffee.“It’s the same struggles that everyone is having – going to the shops and not being able to get handwash and stuff like that.“It’s dficult to do anything really because there is nothing concrete to say when we are going to restart.”When the Dark Blues do finally get back out on the pitch, Kerr expects the good form since the start of February to continue as Dundee look to put their up-and-down start to le in the Championship behind them.“I had said from day one we had a really good group of players at the club and I don’t think it was expected we would be so inconsistent,” he added.“The boys who came in in January have all brought something and we had been doing well up until the shutdown.“We have a standard to meet every day and,we were still playing, we would expect to be getting better and better.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – What the coronavirus could mean for Dundee and Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-what-the-coronavirus-could-mean-for-dundee-and-dundee-united embed # secreteTtVElWoIb\" data-secret\"eTtVElWoIb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b029991d13a2-692x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc dundee united simon murray transfer","story":"Former Dundee and Dundee United striker Simon Murray is targeting ato the Scottish game this summer after playing his last game in South Africa.Murray, , hopes an extension to this season due to the coronavirus shutdown might even see him back in action on home soil before the end of the campaign.The Dundonian has enjoyed the last  months on an adventure at Bidwest Wits in the South African top flight but has had to spend almost the entirety of this season on the sidelines.A damaged cruciate ligament early in the campaign required surgery which saw his place in the squad taken up.Speaking from Johannesburg, he told the Tele: “I hurt my knee in the third game of the season and needed an operation so I’ve been out six-and-a-half months.“Because there’s a limit on the number of foreign players over here, the club signed another forward when I was injured and took my place so we’ve come to an agreement to terminate my contract when I’m fit.“The club have been really good, to be honest, they’ve made sure I got through the injury and looked after me during rehab.“The plan was to stay here in South Africa, get the rehab done and recover from the injury and then head back to Scotland in the summer but because of all this coronavirus it is up in the air.”Murray revealed there has already been interest in his services, once he is back up and running, from Premiership and Championship clubs.He said: “During the injury, I’ve had some interest from a few teams. Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Old folk would come and collect the apples to make pies, sauces and chutney.When the apples from the lower branches had been eaten, the children would climb and pick the ones higher up. It was a game to catch them and put them in a basket.There were so many apples that the older children had to carry the heavy baskets down to the village and shared the apples with everyone.The tree gave so many apples that everyone in the village had as many as they could eat or use. There were always plenty left over on the ground for the animals and insects who also feasted on the fallen ripe fruit. Thankfully nobody owned the tree, it had seeded itself many years ago on the verge of the road that led to the village.Then one year, a traveller arrived just as the apple tree was beginning to bear fruit. He sat under the tree and admired the beauty of it. The apples were ripening in the sun and one of them fell by his feet. He picked it up and ate it. It was crisp and sweet and really delicious.A group of children arrived from the village. ldquoHello mister, they said with a smile, ldquowersquove come to pick apples. They set about picking the most reachable ripe apples, while of course eating some of them in the process.ldquoWhat delicious apples, I must tell my we and children about them, said the traveller as he set off along the road.ldquoHere, said one of the children, holding out a handful of apples. ldquoThese are really ripe, give them to your family. We have more than enough to carry.The traveller smiled. ldquoHow kind, he said. He put them in his pockets and went on his way.But that evening, the child who had given the apples to the traveller was chastised by her parents. ldquoWhy did you do that  Now that man will come back with his family and take our apples.ldquoBut the tree gives us more apples than we can eat, the girl said, ldquosurely a few can be shared with people outside the village. Besides, the tree is by the side of the road, arenrsquot the apples for everyone, thatrsquos what yoursquove always said ldquoYes, they are for everyone, her father replied, ldquobut not just for anyone.His daughter was confused by this answer she didnrsquot understand what it meant. However, it seemed such a small and unimportant issue that she said nothing more of it. She knew that there would be more than enough apples for everyone, and even anyone.A few days later, when the girlrsquos grandmother went to collect ripe apples for a pie, she met the stranger with his we and two children. They had a small basket full of apples. The family were friendly and greeted the grandmother, but she ed a forced smile. She quickly collected her apples and rushed home.She told about the strangerrsquos family collecting the apples and the girlrsquos father was angry.ldquoSee, he said to his daughter, ldquoI told you they were not for just anyone. Now there will be none left for everyone .But his daughter was still confused. There were always many hundreds of apples. ldquoYou are young and donrsquot understand, he said. ldquoTomorrow we will get up early and make sure we can collect our share of the apples.The following day the family were up at the crack of dawn. They took all the baskets they could and went to the apple tree. Their neighbours peered out of the window, wondering what the family were doing.Then they saw them at the apple tree, filling many baskets of ripe apples. Later in the morning, some children from the village joined them.One of them went to pick up an apple that had just fallen. But the grandmother rushed and snatched it first and put it in her basket. So the child just smiled and gently shook a branch and another fell.When the familyrsquos baskets were full, they carried them back to the house. But it took them three trips, and the father left his daughter to guard the full baskets while he and the rest of the family carried as much they could.ldquoWhy are you collecting so many apples at once  asked one of her friends.The young girl nibbled her lip and looked at the ground. ldquoDonrsquot know really. My father says Irsquom too young to understand, but he says the apples are for everyone but not just anyone.ldquoWhorsquos anyone then She looked up and shook her head: ldquoNot sure, but anyone is taking our apples so we have to get them first.When the children of the village ed home with their apples, they told their parents what had happened.ldquoAnyone is taking our apples, so there will not be enough for everyone.The next day, more families got up early and set off for the apple tree.This time, the apple picking was very dferent to the way it had always been. In the past, people would pick the apples with each other, because everyone knew there was enough to go round. This time they were picking them for themselves.Fights started and people began to pull apples that were not ripe. So many people climbed onto the branches to get the apples that the tree started to creak.Soon, not a single apple remained on the tree. For the first time ever, there were none left for the animals or insects. Some peoplersquos homes were so full of apples that they hardly had room to move inside the house.Other people, who were not quick enough, had no apples at all. Some of these were people who really needed the apples. But those who had many wouldnrsquot share them for fear that anyone would get them.The houses of the people who collected more apples than they needed became full of fruit flies and other insects as their piles of apples began to rot.But the next year, everyone was ready. They had made big baskets and were determined not to miss out. But when they arrived at the tree it was surrounded by a hastily built wall with a guard at the gate.ldquoWho has done this  they cried.It was the king. He had heard of the apple tree and how crisp and sweet the apples were, so much so that people would fight and hoard the fruit. So, as the richest and most powerful man in the kingdom, he decided he would make sure the apples graced his table.ldquoBut there are more apples than the king can eat! protested the people.ldquoIndeed, said the guard ldquoand the King is generous. He will sell you the apples he does not need.ldquoSell them  But the apples have always been free for everyone!ldquoNot any more, said the guard.The young girl went up to her father. ldquoNow I understand, she said, ldquoanyone is the king."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-gp-practices-east-lothian-introduce-new-measures","story":"North Berwick Health Centre has announced that none of its registered patients have tested positive for coronavirus and asked that people phone the Edington Hospital in advance before paying it a visit.Those who think they have been in contact with someone with the virus are asked to not visit the surgery and phone  for advice.From Monday , all GP and advanced nurse practitionerappointment requests will be triagedby phone call.Lammermuir Medical Practice in Haddington has also taken this approach.People who call either practice will be asked for a summary of their symptoms, information about recent travel andthey have been in direct contact with a person that has been tested positive for coronavirus.The inidualrsquos GP will thenthe call anddeemed safe and necessary, they will then be given an appointment for that afternoon.Those with pre-booked appointments with a GP will be contacted by the health centre to discuss arrangements.North Berwick Health Centre has removed its self check in service -people now have to check in with a receptionist.It has also launched a new online prescription ordering service, those not registered can visit northberwickhealthcentre.scot.nhs.uk news,.htm, download a form, fill it in and hand it in.Lammermuir Medical Practice has also disabled its online appointment service.Tranent Medical Practice has made its surgery pod, a self-service device that allows patients to get their weight and blood pressure checked, unavailable for use.Those with routine appointments at Harbours Medical Practice in Cockenzie are asked to phone the practice, pressing option two, as it is making changes to its routine appointment system.It has also asked that people with symptoms, those who have had contact with an infected person or those who have been in an affected place to not enter any of its buildings.Prestonpans Group Practice has also given this advice and asked that evenpeople have mild symptoms they should not visit the surgery.Meanwhile, Orchard Medical Practice in Haddington is asking all patients not to attend the practice but instead to phone to request an appointment.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility.

The government website actually encourages people to get plenty of exercise and fresh air.ldquoAt times like these, the website reads, ldquoit can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse.\"Its only warning is not to get too close to other people when outside, asking walkers to stay at least two metres away from each other.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSWhat is coronavirus COVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

Chocolate-box we arenrsquot. All around are plots so lush and well-tended they could be entered at Cha. Our patch is not in their league. Looking out to hills at the back, it opens onto a field, where sheep huddle at night under a blackthorn by our gate, leaving wisps of wool every morning. Chicken wire intended to keep out rabbits has been gnawed by marauders for whom our mossy, tufty grass is irresistible. Nor can we grow a dense hedge to discourage them because, wersquove been told, the horses who share the field with the sheep would bring our wooden fence crashing down as they leaned over to munch it. And needless to say, nothing can keep out the nettles, which wave wildly at me after itrsquos been raining, like kids on a school bus.Burying myself in a rose catalogue is a definition of day-dreaming. The David Austin Handbook of Roses, gted by a green-fingered friend, is jam-packed with temptation. One of the delights of summer is to be taken around this friendrsquos delectable garden. A riot of sweet peas, foxgloves and hollyhocks, with soaring old trees casting welcome shade, its walls are swagged with clematis and honeysuckle. Thanks to her, I now go to sleep in the company of roses called Roald Dahl, Tam OrsquoShanter or The Pilgrim, after the Canterbury Tales. Therersquos Gabriel Oak, hero of Thomas Hardyrsquos Far from the Madding Crowd, or the mercurial Eustacia Vye, from The Return of the Native. Planted together, would they get on or would the results be another tragedy  I seem to remember Darcey Bussell was once askedshe would rather be given a damehood or have a rose named after her. She now has both.Vita Sackville-West was a self-confessed sucker for catalogues. The doyenne of Sissinghurst Castle, in Kent, which she turned into a horticultural paradise with her husband Harold Nicolson, she also wrote a very practical gardening column for The Observer. Early in the autumn of  she complained that catalogues were arriving by every post. ldquoIt is dficult to keep onersquos head. I always lose mine.... Experience tells me that I ought to resist, but, like the poor mutt who falls to the card-sharper in the train, I fall to every list offering plants I cannot afford to buy and could not cultivate successfully evenI could afford them.She was at work when nurseries were only reluctantly opening their doors to amateurs and garden centres were almost unheard of. Catalogues were the way to buy seeds, and seedlings, and set your plot up for the coming year. Many folk in Hoolet have their own greenhouses and potting sheds, but itrsquos as much as I can do to plant something bought in a pot and keep it alive long enough for it to learn to fend for itself. I speak encouragingly to each new arrival, hoping that snow and wind donrsquot kill it before the roots have taken, or some night-time critter digs it up for a taste of bonemeal in which itrsquos bedded.When it comes to roses, I was cheered by the poet James Fentonrsquos advice. He wrote a book about growing a garden from  packets of seed, but with one important caveat: ldquoI do not propose that you start your roses in this way: That would be, as Peter Pan says of death, an awfully big adventure.Seed catalogues are for experts and connoisseurs, a higher level of botanical sophistication and dedication than I ever expect to reach. The New Yorker writer Katharine S White was a devoted gardener at her Maine farmhouse where she lived with her husband, E B White. I have a collection of her gardening columns, Onward  Upward in the Garden, which are surprisingly and disappointingly dull. Occasionally, though, she surprises me.Among her prized catalogues were those by the Calornian rose expert, Will Tillotson. He had a very distinctive style. Indeed, as you find your feet in this new field of prose, you discover all these writers become as identiable as Ernest Hemingway or Muriel Spark. Thinking up new ways of conveying the essence of hundreds of roses must be challenging, and Tillotson once showed the strain: ldquoOh gentle reader, he wrote, ldquoforgive meyou are lsquosleepyrsquo or bored or annoyed. The tired catalogue writer has emptied his sack of adjectives at your feet. This phrase was used as the sign-off to his last catalogue, printed shortly after his death. It was a poignant envoi.The David Austin Handbook is also posthumous, carrying the news of ldquoMr Arsquos death at the end of . He was a Shropshire Lad, which might explain the profusion of literary names and references in his glorious collection and the clarity of the puffs for each plant. As with all plant catalogue writers, the descriptions are as glowing aseach specimen was one of the authorrsquos own brood.I donrsquot think of myself as particularly impetuous, but I anticipate a moment when, like Sackville-West, I too might lose my head. The rosette-like iety named after Anne Boleyn would be fitting, but Irsquom drawn to the simpler kind that remind me of dog-roses found in hedgerows: Open Arms, Rosa complicata, Morning Mist, Fru Dagmar Hastrup, or Rosa rugosa alba, the one known as The Jacobite, with its old-fashioned fragrance, innocent white flowers and wicked thorns."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10147678.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-scotland-msp-miles-briggs-calls-army-scots-volunteers-help-elderly-pandemic","story":"As more hospital beds will be needed for coronavirus victims, patients who are fit to go home should receive assistance from volunteers who can carry our many non-medical tasks.Currently more than , medically fit patients are \"bed-blocking\", unable to leave because there is nowhere suitable to go to receive care.But Scottish Conservative health spokesman, Miles Briggs, believes now is the time for a complete overhaul of how social care is provided to elderly and disabled people.He warned that the situation is going to get worse as the virus takes hold and action is needed now to unblock the system.He said: ldquoI have had emails from constituents, some of whom have non-medical skills, who want to assist.:The Brae owners in tears over abusive messages after offering NHS staff free mealsldquoThose sort of people could be enlisted to help.

But as we were constantly hearing during Brexit, and now with the coronavirus, these are unprecedented times.

STVrsquos Scotland Tonight had already added a peak-time slot on Thursdays, a move station chiefs say has ldquomore than trebled the audience.Ridge on Sunday looked the same.

The distance, coincidentally, is Pymrsquos height.

The scientic community is ided over the best way forward and we are following a particular reading of the science. WHO has consistently advised all countries to test, track and trace every suspected case of the virus. The overwhelming majority of national governments are taking this approach.The UK Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesis the body advising our politicians. As far as I understand, Sage does not believe we can contain the virus using the WHOrsquos methodology. Our Government is, therefore, not making the same effort as others to stop the virus spreading, while attempting to control it in a manner that doesnrsquot put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak. The reason we are testing four times less than Germany is more to do with a dference in approach, rather than an issue of capacity.I am not a scientic authority so my opinion is worth little on this matter. However, the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach is concerning, given the WHOrsquos history in dealing with virus outbreaks. What I find alarming is the lack of discussion, and seeming lack of knowledge, about the path we are on.We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. ldquoWe know best ndash trust us will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn, time is of the essence and so much is at stake.Much of what we usually do has become irrelevant in these extraordinary times. Conversely, this situation demands us to be well informed about certain things most of us would normally have little interest in. A widespread understanding of how our Government is trying to tackle this coronavirus is crucial to overcoming it.Kennedy Stewart, Lerwick.WHILE the Government is to be commended for much of the action taken so far and as the country and the NHS buckles down to cope with possibly then greatest challenge since the Second World War, there is one shut-down whose consequences, I suggest, may not have been fully considered.I refer to that affecting patients suffering from inoperable and incurable cancers, of which I, unfortunately, am one. We have been informed that endoscopy units, where palliative care such as periodically burning of the growth with lasers takes place, have been closed indefinitely.Last summer, I was given the bleak prognosis of anything from six months to  months. My cancer was subjected to laser burning and not only do I neither look or feel like a cancer sufferer, my tumour had actually shrunk slightly after my last treatment.There will be, I am sure, many more like me throughout Scotland, people whose le expectancy depends on the success of this treatment and I have no wish to jump any queue. But it seems illogical to me to deny treatment to people who actually need it, so that resources can be erted and reserved for those who might need it.I realise the NHS is and will be under tremendous pressure in the weeks and months to come and that only a minority are thus affected, but surely the Government has a duty of care to us as much as to potential Covid- victims I have been told that the only way I might be treated will beI become an emergency case, i.e.I begin to bleed uncontrollably, or my oesophagus obstructs. By then, I suggest, it may be beyond remedy.Surely, we too are entitled to hope for such le as can be procured for us by this vital treatment to spend with our loved ones.Charles Duncan, Glasgow G.THIS Covid- crisis must surely spell the end of the road for our self-indulgent entitlement society with its emphasis upon the rights of the inidual.Now we must recapture a sense of responsibility and sacrice to protect the community at large.Only today I heard of a shopper displaying the height of irresponsibility in a local supermarket.That person was wandering through the aisles, coughing, sneezing and spluttering while making no attempt to cover nostrils or mouth.Shops would be well advised to put up posters at their entrances in bold, clear type asking customers displaying such symptoms not to enter their stores and to get neighbours to shop for them or order their goods online.Knowing full well that the NHS could well be swamped with so many cases that they will be unmanageable, we may have to adopt the time-honoured custom of women and children first in an emergency.If the hospital system reaches such a breaking point, then priorities about deciding who can be treated successfully will have to come into the equation.These are hard choices but they will have to be taken in the interests of the wider community.The Devil Take The Hindmost and the Irsquom all right Jack mentalities have to be flushed out of our societal systemwe are to survive as a species.This pandemic is but one manestation of where responsibilities need to take precedence over rights.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.WHILE there has been justied criticism of panic buyers and hoarders in the current Coronavirus emergency, there is another type whose activities are even more deserving of the publicrsquos scorn, namely the profiteers.Yesterday, when we were down our last bar of our preferred soap, Imperial Leather, I idly browsed eBay. Prices for this soap ied from around pound a bar, not unreasonable, to pound for six, to three figures for the same, but as far as pound, for six bars. It seems that some scabrous Thatcherites are cashing in on the shortages that they have helped to create. At the same time online footage of a tearful nurse at the end of a y sht gazing at supermarket shelves picked clean by ldquolocusts arouses our indignation. While Kevin McKennawrites in hope that the current emergency may bring out the best in our citizenry, the evidence seems to suggest the reverse. Forty years of neo-liberalist doctrines backed by successive Conservative governments are reaping their grim harvest.Similar outbreaks of profiteering occurred at the beginning of both world wars and eventually the governments of the day, deciding that ldquothe market was not sacrosanct, introduced rationing. While this may be an over-reaction at this point, eBay should consider action to prevent leeches taking advantage of the short-term misery of health and other key workers.Larry Cheyne, Bishopbriggs.MANY thanks and congratulations to Tom Gordon for his article ldquoDeath was doing the rounds long before the virus arrived . The statistics he provides are a much-needed reality check on the current Covid situation and should give us all pause for reflection.Jessie Reid, Dalry.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WHEN anti-coronavirus measures are being considered, may I ask for the importance of walking for exercise for the sake of onersquos health to be taken on board It seems to be that ldquostay at home is being used as meaning the same as ldquodonrsquot mix with others, but they arenrsquot equivalent. The latter is highly desirable, but there is no need to stay at home to walk in the countryside or along a canal, where the risk of catching or spreading infection would appear to be negligible.People need exercise as well as dogs. As a dogless walker, I have the experience of being looked at strangely because I walk without a dog.Paul Brownsey, Bearsden.HAVING failed to be able to buy contributions for the food bank at a supermarket I wonderthey could set up an online contribution service. People could even select from a list of items most needed at food banks, pay, and the items could be kept behind thescenes to be distributed directly as a priority.Elizabeth Allen, Glasgow G.THANK you so such much for your very moving front pageldquoWhen yoursquore on your own, we are there with you and the words signed by your editor, Donald Martin.

Nobody could have predicted the scale of the devastation, both socially and economically, wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. With large swathes of the economy essentially forced to shut up shop for months - and faced by the quick and unied action of the trade unions - Mr Sunak was left with little alternative but to make this unprecedented intervention, the like of which was not even seen in wartime, and which will almost certainly end up dwarfing the bank bailout of  by comparison.By forcing the Conservative government into a corner on this state intervention, the pandemic has also forced them to admit some truths that many would rather stayed hidden. Large-scale borrowing is possible. Citizens can be bailed out, not just banks and business. There can be support when things go wrong. Therersquos always been enough to go round.These are truths that have long been scoffed at when those on the left tried to highlight them - most recently Jeremy Corbynrsquos Labour Party in last yearrsquos General Election which, unbelievably, took place just three months ago. Plans for wide-ranging nationalisation, the abolishment of tuition fees and free broadband for all were made a laughing stock of by opposition politicians and establishment media alike, whose taunting most often took some form of the question ldquohow are you going to pay for that Many will remember the BBCrsquos Emma Barnett mockingly asking Angela Raynerthe party wanted to nationalise sausages it wasnrsquot necessary for the Conservative Chancellor to specically mention meat-based products in last weekrsquos announcement when he essentially nationalised almost every industry in the country in one quick sweep.When former prime minister Theresa May infamously remarked that ldquothere isnrsquot a magic money tree we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want, it was in response to a nurse whose pay had been frozen for eight years and who was struggling to survive on her wage. If it seemed callous at the time, it seems unthinkable in the current moment. Not only does the magic money tree exist, underpaid nurses and their like should be first in line to shake it.Because while Mr Sunak deserves few platitudes for doing the only thing possible and conscionable under current circumstances, he will surely be credited with changing politics forever. Now wersquove seen that money can be borrowed to help those in need, how can we ever justy leaving people homeless on the streets  Now we know therersquos no limit on the cost of state intervention, why should anyone struggling ever have to pay for childcare  When itrsquos clear that political will is all that stands between poverty and the spending of trillions of pounds, how can we ever look at a foodbank again The genie is out of the bottle: the free market is not infallible or inevitable ending inequality is possible. Things can never be the same again.Of course, this is not the utopia that any on the left would wish for. Short-term crisis response is not an ideology, and nor is the maintained concentration of the levers of power with a small group of politicians socialism. But the scale of intervention pledged by Sunak cannot be overstated or removed from its context in history: in the UK, in our letimes and beyond, we have never seen the likes of it.Coronavirus has already put immense strain on the worldrsquos citizens and the global economy, with far worse expected to come. Praise for Mr Sunak has been widespread across the political and media class since his announcement, with many who have long sneered at ldquoCorbynomics lauding the Chancellor for his decisive leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"these are the 10 most popular dog breeds in the uk","story":"Research conducted by Dogfriendlycottages found that these are the  most popular dog breeds in the UK - do you agree .

At this stage it is essential that we sequence our approach with the National Government responses.”The council’s current understanding — at this time — is that Scottish Government support which will be made available to businesses across Scotland will include:It is expected that the Scottish Government will put all these measures into law on Tuesday, March , and will provide further details at that time.It is understood that Orkney Islands Council will be responsible for administering rate reliefs and grants — the council will be in touch with local businesses who are eligible in the coming weeks when we have sufficient information from the Scottish Government on these matters.Mr Barr continued: “This is a rapidly evolving situation and we will continue to keep track of the national schemes as details emerge and consider what actions are then appropriate locally to ensure effective support for our local businesses.“The council has had contact from business representatives this week and will be looking to arrange a more formal discussion with those representatives next week, by which time it is hoped that there will be further information available on the national schemes for us to consider how best to manage this situation for Orkney.”Business Gateway in Orkney is developing relevant information and support to help businesses with the Coronavirus pandemic and the challenges they now face. That information is on their website and will be continuously updated.Claire Kemp, of Business Gateway Orkney, said: “We are determined to remain open to deliver free support to local businesses. Our advisers continue to provide help with a wide range of business matters including continuity planning, though to protect everyone#s health and well-being this won#t be face-to-face but by phone, email and other online communication tools.#As we identy common issues and needs, we intend to deliver further support online using, for example, webinars.”Every effort is being made using all methods of communication to keep businesses and their employees with as up-to-date information as possible, she added.“The rapidly changing situation for many is a real concern, but we are here to offer any support and advice we can and it is critical that the national level support which will be forthcoming is effectively targeted and accessed by local businesses.“We would suggest that people follow our social media or get in touch directly on    . We would like to thank businesses for their patience at this very challenging time and assure them that we will pass on any national guidance as soon as we are informed.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What is alarming is how little challenge there has been to our government#s decision to take a dferent path from that recommended by the World Health Organisation . Shetland, Scotland and the UK is out of synch with almost everywhere  in how we are trying to tackle this coronavirus. We are not #following the science#, as ‘experts’ and politicians of ious colours frequently suggest. The scientic community is itself ided over this issue and we are following a particular reading of the science.WHO’s consistent advice has been to test, track and trace every suspected case of coronavirus. The overwhelming majority of countries are taking this approach. The UK Scientic Advisory Group For Emergencies , the body advising our politicians, do not believe we can contain the virus using the WHO#s methodology, so our government has allowed the virus to spread, while attempting to control itin a manner that doesn#t put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak.My opinion is worth little on this matter # but the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach concerns me, given the WHO#s history in dealing with virus outbreaks such as this. What disturbs me is the apparent lack of awareness about UK exceptionalism on this issue. We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. #We know best # trust us# will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn and so much is at stake. You are not an idiot. Please don#t let name calling, or whatever, put you off getting better informed about this most crucial of matters.At last count  out of the  countries that presently exist have recorded cases#.How do you know who is taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done or how those governments rhetoric dfers from the actual reality  We have much ignorance and  information in the media, and as always the headless-chicken doom-merchants tell fake tails of doom. Only yesterday a self-ordained fitness person Facebooked about a boy trapped with the corpse of his sister for three days. The actual truth no otherwise healthy child has died worldwide of Covid, not one ever. The boy was a man, the sister was  and died of status epilepticus! Just what possesses people to peddle such tripe is beyond comprehension, but the online media is awash with it.For heaven#s sake Helen, we have gone beyond our capacity to trace, let alone test. Whatever did you write your PhD thesis in, headlesschikenology or alarmistscarmongology !Faroes which have fixed links between the islands have  times as many cases as Shetland. May just be coincidence but i would have thought that fixed links help spread disease more quickly.Yes Ian, a car in a tunnel does go a little bit faster than a ferry. So the spread by fixed link will perhaps be accelerated by a few minutes. Now, what probably makes more sense is that Faroe has a population of , rather more than  times that of Shetland., proportionally per head of population,Faroe, fixed links and all is doing rather better than us!!!Ian T.I think you may have accidently hit an extra  there # The current population of the Faroe Islands is c. , Ian, Faroe had a population of , as of June  .

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace.

It will further strengthen our agreed plan as a council to combat COVID-.“Leisure centres have been identied as high risk locations for the transmission of the virus with a high volume of people in close proximity and sharing equipment.“As a Council there is an obligation on us to not only protect the citizens of this city, but also our leisure centre and council staff.“Sinn Féin will actively work in Belfast City Council, as we are doing across the island, to protect the health and well-being of all our citizens in the time ahead.” In West Belfast, institutions such as Felons club, Andersonstown Social Club and the Roddy McCorley Society have closed with immediate effect.A statement from the Andersonstown Social Clubread: “Due to the current health crisis around the coronavirus and its impending and unprecedented impact the Andersonstown Social Clubwill be closed indefinitely.“We apologise for the sudden nature of this announcement but we had to move quickly to protect staff members and patrons and their families by not providing a close contact environment for large gatherings in the club.“We are alert to the impact this has also for our staff and employment and will be working closely with them in the time ahead. Our clubs ethos is embedded in republicanism and the community and it in the time ahead we all need to be there for each other.“Look out for our neighbours, the elderly, the infirm and those in general who can’t do it alone!“We wish everyone well in the time ahead.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus meet the irish immunologist working around the clock on a covid","story":"Research: Dr David Dowlingwith programme director Dr Ofer Levy FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappResearch: Dr David Dowlingwith programme director Dr Ofer LevyAmy MolloyMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailIt#s .am in Boston and Bray native Dr David Dowling is already a few hours into his working day.On top of his day job trying to make vaccines to fight two of the biggest pandemics witnessed in the past  years, the Dublin City University graduate is now also a stay-at-home dad.Schools and childcare centres in America have closed as a result of the rapid spread of Covid-, and now Dr Dowling is having to balance developing a vaccine, social distancing and minding his two children.I got up at .am, I#ll work until about .am and then I#ve to go home and look after my kids - I#m doing the early sht and my we, who is also a scientist, will do the late sht, he told the Irish Independent.Dr Dowling is a research associate with the precision vaccine programme at Boston Children#s Hospital and an instructor at Hard Medical School.The -year-old graduated from DCU with a degree in biotechnology in  and went on to obtain a PhD there in immunology, vaccinology and parasitology in .I finished my PhD at a time when the financial world imploded and that meant I was told there were no jobs for me in Ireland, but I got two job offers in Hard and Yale, he said.I was living through the Celtic Tiger years on a wage of around €, while everyone around me was building houses. It was bizarre... my le seems to be shaped by geopolitical disasters.About nine months ago, his team at Boston Children#s Hospital received a €m federal government grant to help develop an influenza vaccine for elderly people and children.However, the Co Wicklow man had been keeping a close watch on coronavirus developments in China, and three months ago his team got government approval to turn it into a dual project.There are now dozens of projects worldwide working around the clock to create a coronavirus vaccine, but Dr Dowling is co-leading a project which is specically targeting the most vulnerable in society - the elderly.Older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with Covid-, according to the World Health Organisation.Together with Dr Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines programme at the hospital, Dr Dowling is designing a coronavirus vaccine that uses special molecules to boost the immune system.The coronavirus gets its name because each cell is covered with spiky formations that make it look like a crown, or in Latin #corona#. These are called spike proteins.The vaccine will use the virus#s spike protein along with known vaccine adjuvants - small molecules that increase a patient#s immune response.He and Dr Levy#s team have taken blood samples from patients aged between  and , are separating their white blood cells and testing dferent adjuvants to see which work best.The unique vaccine will build on vaccines from prior coronavirus outbreaks and work to make them more effective.I reached out to Dr Peter Hotez at Texas Children#s Hospital and we got his Sars antigen from the  outbreak, Dr Dowling said.He made a vaccine and never got it all the way into clinical trials and ran out of funding as it [Sars] wasn#t an issue any more.So using the current Sars vaccine and mixing it with our best adjuvant, we hope it can make a dference.As for a timeline on when the vaccine may be ready, Dr Dowling says it largely depends on funding.I spent  hours filling out a grant application for this coronavirus project, when that time could be spent far more practically, he said.Dr Dowling thinks developing a vaccine is imperative, as he believes coronavirus could become a seasonal virus.I do believe that it may have been circulating for a long time and has only come to the forefront now, he said.Right now we are heading towards the peak of it, people are social distancing and we#ll see it relax coming into summer, but there is a distinct possibility it could come back again in winter.That#s why we have to keep working and can#t take time off. I have great confidence in my colleagues and the US government that we can push through to develop a vaccine.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Independent.ie  Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandHealth chief says Covid- war ‘can be won with communities’Health Service Executive chief Paul Reid has said the country faces into a “an uncertain, unprecedented and unpredictable” time during the Covid- pandemic.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Eileen with her daughter Siobhan on Siobhan’s wedding day, wearing the blue outfit she had wanted to be buried inCatherine FeganMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailEileen O’Neill knew death was approaching. She had been in isolation since last Friday, shunted away from the people she loved and desperately frightened by everything she could see around her.Faceless figures in biohazard suits, double-gloved hands checking her pulse, knowing glances behind medical-grade goggles.She was lucid and conscious, right up to the very end, in the solitary company of a virus she had feared would come for her long before it did.“Mum had told me she was afraid of getting it,” her daughter Siobhan said.“For her to get it and then be put in isolation was extremely frightening for her. I know she was scared. I know that. That’s the reality of this virus. You can’t be with someone you love when they need you. All the normal things you do when someone is sick and approaching the end, like mopping their brow, holding their hand, whispering into their ear, you can’t do any of that and that person is completely alone.”Less than a week ago, -year-old Eileen, a glamorous, independent woman who had overcome numerous health battles, entered an isolation ward in St Vincent’s hospital, Dublin.She had fallen ill at home in Loughlinstown and paramedics recorded a high temperature. She was immediately tested for Covid-.Eileen was put in an isolation ward and her family were not allowed to visit. Her test result on Sunday was positive.“When I got the call from the hospital I knew straight away that was it,” said Siobhan. “I knew it would take more than a miracle to pull her through this. I askedhad she been told and they initially said no. I was relieved to hear that because she herself was so frightened of Covid and I knew it would have a negative effect on her. And then there was the fact we couldn’t be with her, I knew that would compound things.”From that point on, Eileen O’Neill’s end-of-le journey took a path her heart-broken loved ones had to send her on alone. The protocols were clear. Under no circumstances could any family members go to see her. Instead, communication would be done by phone. Two years away from turning , Eileen was still working off an “old brick mobile”. There would be no Facetime, no picture exchanges.“It was extremely dficult,” said Siobhan. “But we knew how serious the virus was and that we had to abide by the rules.”For Siobhan Cullen and her family, the news that Eileen had become infected with the deadly virus came as a shock. Due to her underlying respiratory issues, all the necessary precautions had been taken to ensure she was protected long before any cases were recorded here.“She was completely immobile due to a previous stroke,” said Siobhan.“The past two weeks she gave no indication that there was anything wrong with her, apart from being tired. We were all very, very cautious around her. She hadn’t been out of the house since February and she had only seen five people, all of whom had been taking precautions. Her two carers have tested negative for the virus and the other three people, including me, were all family.”Alone, frightened and unaware of the growing pandemic claiming lives across the world, Eileen counted down the hours in silence.“She was alone,” said Siobhan.“I know she was getting the best care, but I also know there was no one sitting beside her. I know she was looking at all those people coming and going, suited and booted, and she would have known why. That’s heart-breaking for me to think about.”Last weekend, as the nation got to grips with a sweeping set of measures, Siobhan remained at home, powerless. She was now in self-isolation, following the advice of her GP, waiting to be tested. Updates on her mother’s condition were regular, but she knew there was an increasing climate of caution. She began to make plans for the possibility that her mother might not survive.“I asked the staff at St Vincent’s Hospitalwe would be allowed to get in to see herit came to the end,” she said. “Through no fault of anyone, the protocols on this are changing on the hour. One lady I spoke to said yes, arrangements would be made... and the next time when she[Eileen] was moved I was told there were no guarantees. That was hard for me to hear.”By Tuesday, Eileen had been moved closer to a nurses’ station where she could be monitored evermore closely. The following day, Siobhan got a call, asking her to come to see her mother.“I knew it was time. Nothing prepares you for what you have to do to see a loved one dying from this.”In an isolated area behind a reception desk, Siobhan and her brother Kenneth took instruction from two nurses and a doctor on how to robe up for entry into the isolation unit: covers over their shoes a full- gown with full sleeves two pairs of gloves, one placed over the other. Each step of the way, washing their hands.That was just the start.“There is a beanie-type hat for your head that you tie at the back,” recalled Siobhan. “You have a facemask but it’s not the normal facemask that you tie at the back. It’s much tougher and it completely seals your mouth and nosetotally. It expands as you breathe.“You have a pair of goggles and then over the goggles you put on a full facial visor. They have hand gel there and at every step you are washing your hands as well. My mum was totally conscious when we walked in like that.”As they were guided along a corridor, Siobhan and Kenneth were told that once they were with their mother, they could not touch her face, but were permitted to hold her hand. “I was very conscious thatwe didn’t abide by that we wouldn’t be let in.“That was my big fear because the protocols were changing daily. I was just so happy to get to see her that I didn’t want to put a foot wrong.“My brother couldn’t stay. He just couldn’t do it. We had to tell her who we were, but that wasn’t because she wasn’t conscious or didn’t recognise us, it was because everyone looked the same.”Faced with a situation that was growing ever more beyond her control, Siobhan decided not to tell her mother that she was nearing the end of her le.“I just didn’t want to frighten her,” she said.“I didn’t want her to know why I was there, and when she asked I just said that I got fed up not being able to hold her hand. The doctor played along. I think that deep down my mum knew why I was there. I know in my heart that she knew the truth, but she went with it.”As day turned to night, Siobhan kept vigil at her mother’s bedside, listening as she struggled to breathe, but clung to le. Anything that went into the room could not go out, so she had no mobile phone and was unable to communicate with family.“I stayed all night,” she said. “I was there, in all that gear, holding her hand. I talked to her all night long, about my dad, about when we were young, about her grandkids. I talked and talked and talked. I told her daddy was waiting for her. I said rosaries out loud, rosaries in my head.“She kept telling me to go home. Her breathing was very poor and deteriorating. She was literally fighting for a breath. At one stage she said to me, ‘Do you think I’ll pull through this ’ I said, ‘I don’t think so, Mam’.”It was a lonely night, recalled Siobhan. She had kept vigil before beside people who had died and the reassuring visit of a nurse on those occasions, in and out in a show of support, had always been a comfort. Covid- denied her any such humanity.“I was so aware that no one could come in,” said Siobhan. “You don’t have the staff coming in and out to check on you or comfort you. Nobody was coming in unless they absolutely had to. It was so cold and clinical.”Eileen passed away shortly after pm on Wednesday. She struggled until the very end.“She had a horrendous death,” said Siobhan. “When she died, I sat with her for an hour, holding her hand and then I had to be pragmatic about what would happen next. I knew there was a chance we wouldn’t get her personal belongings back so I had to remove all her jewellery and take it there and then. It sounds so mercenary but that’s what I had to do.”The most dficult conversations came next. Siobhan was told that her mother’s body would be “double bagged” in a high-spec body bag. Eileen would not be taken to the chapel of rest, but instead to a specially designated area in the morgue.“The staff there had to leave. The people who met us had to be gowned. We couldn’t touch her, and we got  minutes with her. I want people to understand how devastating that was.”This week, as she self-isolated, Siobhan prepared for her mother’s burial in circumstances that are hard to believe.Consultations with the undertaker have had to be done via video-link. Mourners have not been able to call to her home. Grief is being held in suspension while Covid- tightens its grip over a family in a very surreal time of despair.“Death is very much a part of le,” said Siobhan. “Here in Ireland, we commemorate the dead so well. For us, trapped at home at the mercy of this virus, there are no arms to fall into for a hug. My friends can’t come and pay their respects. We can’t come together and mourn. People need to understand the devastating domino effect of this virus and all that it brings to your door.”Struck down by coronavirus at the age of , the long le of Eileen O’Neill will today end with a short ceremony at a funeral parlour in Dublin.It will not be the ending she wanted. Her funeral wishes, expressed long ago to her nearest and dearest, included carefully selected hymns and readings. She had picked out the flowers, the gts, the pallbearers. She wanted to be dressed in the navy outfit she wore to Siobhan’s wedding.None of that will be possible. Today, in a small funeral home in Dublin, four people will gather to say their farewells. Communion will be passed around on tissue paper. There will be no burial Mass.“This virus is vicious, and it leaves people to die an extremely lonely death. My mother will be buried with just four of us present. Her coffin will have to be disinfected after we leave her and none of us can grieve with our wider family and friends because we have to self-isolate until we are tested.“This is the cruellest end to a le.” In memory of Eileen, Siobhan is asking readers to consider donating to Feed The Heroes herePlease log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Independent.ie  Related ContentCoronavirusFunerals should be held in private, mourners urgedChurches here are urging their clergy to hold all funerals in private because of the coronavirus crisis.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We thank you for the many times you put us before yourselves to prepare us for our final exams and in everyday le at school. All of your hard work will never be forgotten, and we are sad we cannot go in and smash those final exams and do you proud in the ways we have done in the past. “To our friends and school community, thank you. We thank you for the many years of friendship, all the laughter and all of the memories. We didn’t expect it to be cut short so soon, but it has. Now we need to look after each other and do all we can to help the most vulnerable at this very trying time. “To the NHS workers and everyone on the frontline who is looking after us all at this traumatising time and risking their own lives doing so, a ‘thank you’ will never be enough for you. What you are doing and continue to do is simply amazing and it is dficult to express our gratitude to you in words but thank you. “To the superheroes who aren’t wearing capes in our community and across the globe right now who are running errands for the most vulnerable, even just checking up on people self-isolating down the road, getting people their prescriptions, delivering supplies to those in need and just being selfless incredible people – we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “To those who have been left unemployed because of this pandemic or those who are struggling financially at this dficult time, we have you in our thoughts and prayers. We will get through this, but onlywe work together. Thank you for remaining strong and calm. Never forget that there is light at the end of the tunnel. “To the vulnerable, the elderly and those at high-risk of catching COVID- or those currently suffering – please be strong. You are in our thoughts and prayers. You will get through this have faith… we believe in you. “To those in the world at this time helping turn adversity into advantage – we see you and you are amazing.

I think she would#ve preferred a more secure occupation, Holly said.Now a regular on the BBC Breakfast sofa, Holly praised Kim online after opting to stay in England with husband, Co Armagh broadcaster Connor Phillips, due to the coronavirus.Dates like Mother#s Day are always dficult as it#s a reminder that we can#t just pop round to see our family when we want to! I always make sure the card arrives on time, though... I wouldn#t hear the end of it otherwise!Although my parents are both healthy and in their s, it#s so important to take every possible precaution, she said.It#s about maintaining the spread and not being anywhere we don#t have to be.Asked what traits she inherited from the former journalist, Holly joked she missed out on her physique.We#re both quite stubborn, enjoy a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and are never wrong, she said.People say we look alike, but sadly I didn#t get her legs!Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCarl Frampton, we Christine and children Carla and Rossa FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCarl Frampton, we Christine and children Carla and RossaProving that boxers are more than just a tough exterior, Belfast sportsman Carl Frampton hailed his we for all she does for their family.Carlshares Carlaand Rossawith Christine , who he wed in .Alongside a holiday snap with his brood, the former two-weight world champion wrote: Happy Mother#s Day to the mother of our kids.

While she usually pens her bestselling thrillers in an office at her mum#s house, the former journalist said that she is now missing her company. I do feel a little asmy right arm has been chopped off, Claire said. That helps keep it all in perspective, I suppose. If it#s hard not to see her for a few days or weeks, it would be unbearable to not have her in my le anymore. She is particularly susceptible to the virus and it could have devastating consequences for her. So as hard as this is for all of us, it#s so important we do all we can to ensure she is kept safe.Mum is still relatively young, I want her to be around for a lot, lot longer!Claire credits Karen for passing on her sense of fun, her caring nature and for teaching her to be a good listener.For many of us, Sunday was a chance to shower our mums with love and flowers, but for some it brings a painful longing for the women who are no longer with us.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDaniel Baker and his late mother Edna FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDaniel Baker and his late mother EdnaJust eight months after losing his own mother, Belfast Lord Mayor Daniel Baker said he would love nothing more than to show her his appreciation.The Sinn Fein councillor took up the role of First Citizen last December.

There, I’ve said it. It wasn’t that hard really. The truth is that I don’t always wear my Catholic badge with pride. There are things that I like and dislike about the Catholic Church, but I am a practising Catholic, and in a world where that isn’t always the coolest thing to say, I don’t mind saying it, out loud.I’ve always been a believer, I was raised in a devoutly Catholic family. I remember the pride in my parents’ faces at church when a woman pointed at me and my brother and sisters, and said she’d never seen a family so well-behaved at Mass.My faith had good foundations because of the people around me. My earliest memory of church is being taken to Benediction with my granny, nose pressed to the seat in front of me as I knelt, listening to the priest recite lines and lines of Latin phrases that I couldn’t understand. The memory of my granny’s wrinkled hand in mine guiding me through the Rosary beads, and the smell of incense is as real to me now, as it was then.As a teenager, I went to Mass every night, something I kept a closely-guarded secret from all my friends. I didn’t want to be called a Holy Joe. While my friends were all getting part-time jobs in what was the newly-opened Foyleside in the early s, my first job was in the priests’ house, where there was always a stack of black shirts that needed ironed.After moving to Belfast in  to attend Queen’s University, my faith seemed to drt. I did attend a few events in the University Catholic Chaplaincy, but the freedom of living away from home and the pub culture meant my churchgoing took a hit.It didn’t bother me. I attended Mass sporadically over the years – Christmas, weddings, funerals, and whenever my parents forced me to. I hadn’t stopped believing, but that need to go to Mass just wasn’t there anymore. I suppose as I’ve got older I had been thinking about my faith more, and a chance opportunity to attend Lough Derg in  changed everything for me. I was working as a journalist and was asked to attend with a group of pilgrims from the Derry Diocese along with Bishop Donal McKeown. I thought nothing more of it than that it would make a good story.The three days I spent on the island ended up being much more than research for a newspaper article. The peace of Lough Derg, and the break from the constant distraction of the modern world gave me the space to reconnect with my faith. I hadn’t been to Confession for over  years believing it to be outdated and unnecessary, but at Lough Derg, I experienced a new, grown-up type of confession that dfered from my childish practice of rhyming off sins.Now, aged , I hope I have a much more mature attitude to my faith. I don’t hide the fact that I go to Mass, because I really don’t care what other people think about that.But being a Catholic, and someone who is not afraid to say they are a Catholic comes with its own challenges. The Church has been through dficult years with issues that can never be brushed under the carpet. Friends of mine have told me they’ll neverto Mass because they’ll never trust the Church again. Many of my friends, while they don’t share my faith, have the deepest respect for it. On a recent weekend away to England with buddies, I announced on the Saturday night that I was going to find a chapel to go to Mass. Instead of going alone, I ended up taking ten people along with me.Having faith isn’t always something that comes naturally – there are days when I feel I’m just going through the motions and doubting everything, and there are other days when I feel completely connected to God.I know that in the most dficult situations in my le I have felt God’s presence with me. That can sometimes be a dficult statement to make, when being a card-carrying Catholic and a woman of faith is something that is so easily ridiculed in modern society. I can’t say I do, or will ever agree with all aspects of the Catholic Church. The Church has much work to do. More recognition must be given to the vital role played by women, and I hope some day that church will be more accepting of same-sex relationships. I’ve seen first-hand the upset caused to my gay friends who have felt abandoned by the church. My faith will always be important to me. Because I’m so vocal about it, I’m often stopped by people who ask me to pray for a special intention for them, light a candle, or even asked where is the nearest place they can buy a Mass card  Faith is something that should be cherished. I feel hugely grateful for having it in my le. I enjoy volunteering for my parish by the little bits and pieces I do to help. I am very grateful for the people around me who respect my faith, and those who share it with me. I suppose I still fear the Holy Joe label, because I know I’m far from a Holy Joe, but I suppose there are worse things I could be called. googletag.cmd.push Erin Hutcheon is PR and marketing officer with the North West Regional College.

I came up with an idea for an initiative to try to promote a more positive perspective for people at what feels like a very dark time for everyone. Its my suggestion that, while we remain in this time of social distancing, people place a set of Christmas lights in a front window of their home to promote a feeling of togetherness, mutual support and as a gesture of gratitude for all those who are out there still working to help all us through this dficult time.She believes this simple gesture could have a powerful effect, especially for children.At night when we look out and see the lights twinkling from our neighbours windows, well be reminded that were all in this together and united in our support for one another. It will also be symbolic of our hope and a reminder that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. googletag.cmd.push This message and initiative is particularly important for children who, while they seem to be relatively unaffected by this virus health-wise, can be massively affected by anxiety, both their own and that of the people around them.Ms Doherty has set up an instagram page Light Up Initiative where people have already been sharing pictures of their lit up windows. Its such an important message so Im encouraging everyone to continue share the light @lightupinitiative, she added. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We are publishing extracts from the book. In this latest article, Brian examines what the local area was like in the Bronze Age.   One Autumn’s day in  a local farmer ploughing his hill-top field, overlooking the River Foyle, hooked a large flat stone, of dimensions  feet by  feet, and brought it to the surface.There it remained while the winter’s frosts worked to break up the soil.It was members of Shantallow Local History Society, out searching for flint fragments, the evidence of prehistoric settlement, who on coming across this large flat stone realised it was perhaps the capping stone of a Bronze Age grave.The Archaeological Branch of the Department of the Environment was called in, who, on one very wet March day in , carried out an emergency dig.Small village What they found convinced them that here in the townland of Shantallow, on the fringe of the present-day city of Derry, in the early years of the second millennium BC, lived a small village community of farmers who had trade connections with the flint-mining areas of County Antrim, and who in a nearby cemetery buried their dead.The stone which had lain undisturbed for some , years was, in fact, the capping stone of a cist tomb.Around , BC a circular pit,  to  feet deep, had been dug on the brow of a small hill,  feet above the River Foyle.In the middle of this pit slabs of stone had been laid on edge to create a stone box,  feet long by  feet wide.The corpse, with his or her knees folded up to its chest, had been placed in this coffin on its side.Rotted awayOnly part of the skull and part of the leg bone remained of this skeleton, as the rest of the body had rotted away through contact with the soil.Behind the neck of the corpse was an earthenware pot in the shape of a bowl and decorated with jagged imprints.This bowl had been made specically for the burial ceremony.It is clear that these people believed in some form of afterle, as the bowl would have been filled with food or drink to sustain the body after death in the journey through the underworld.The cist in which the corpse lay was then roofed with a capstone. In this case, as occurred on other sites, the grave wasn’t marked above the ground with a mound of earth.The farmer had inadvertently uncovered on this hill-top site a Bronze Age cemetery.Short cistThis distinctive form of burial, in a short cist with an upright bowl-shaped food vessel, is not unique to Ireland.It has been found all over Europe, even as far east as Russia. It represents the spread of the so-called Beaker peoples, named after their pottery, who originated in lands around the mouth of the Rhine, then spread to Northern Britain and from there to Ireland. Around the early years of the second millennium they had reached Shantallow.These people were settled pastoralists who introduced metal-working into Ireland.Near the cist in Shantallow fragments of flint, which is not a native rock of this area, were found, and the area of their greatest concentration marked the spot where a small community lived.Shantallow clearly supported a Bronze Age village.The flints were fashioned to be used as arrowheads and thumbscrapers.The arrowheads would have been used in hunting while the thumb-shaped flint scrapers would have been used in the preparation of animal skins before they were cured.Clothes would have been made from this leather.No metal artefacts were found, but in other cist burials hundreds of metal implements have been found.Ireland possessed abundant supplies of copper, and these people exploited in a large way Irish copper and gold, as evidenced by the metal axes, knives and daggers they left behind.Their most outstanding personal ornament was the sheet-gold lanula, a crescent-shaped neck ornament.The settlers at Shantallow were primarily livestock farmers.With their metal axes they would have begun to clear some of the surrounding forest to expose good pasture land. Here cattle were grazed for their beef.They would also have grown wheat, oats and barley, with the grain being ground on saddle-querns.Within an earth enclosure, perhaps topped with a palisade of timber stakes, the early inhabitants of Shantallow would have lived in small, single-room, circular wicker huts.Their houses were probably built of posts and wattle rods.Thin saplingsStrong posts were driven into the ground, and thin saplings of hazel, elm or ash were woven between them to form the walls. Then the walls were plastered with daub in which mud was mixed with straw.This mixture dried very hard to create a sturdy homestead.The roofs would have been thatched with straw or rushes obtained from marshy ground.Our early settlers at Shantallow would have only made a small impact on the forests which clothed this area.Only the hill top would have been cleared of wood.On a clear day, rising above the trees that swept down to the banks of the Foyle on both sides of the river, the early dwellers of Shantallow might have spotted, some two miles to the south-east across the river, smoke curling up from open hearths on Rough Island in Enagh Lough.FragmentsFinds of late Stone Age and Bronze Age pottery fragments on this island, lying almost in the middle of the lake, roughly circular in shape, with a diameter of  feet and now largely overgrown with trees and shrubs, identies this as a settlement site around the same time as the community of Shantallow were burying one of their members.This site on Enagh Lough, termed a crannog, was formed by a  of timber, overlain with a layer of packed stones almost  feet deep, being placed, timber by timber and stone by stone, on top of a marshy island created by glacial dumping during the last Ice Age.Bronze spearheads, flint flakes and abraded stones, worn away by man’s rubbing or scraping, attest to its settlement in prehistoric times.Around the edge of the crannog there may have been a defensive palisade of timber stakes with lighter branches of wattle woven in and out through them.Very similarThe houses inside, built of wicker, wattling and daub, and the lestyle would have been very similar to those at Shantallow.Barley, wheat and oat impressions found on the pottery fragments are evidence of the cultivation of these crops in fields around the shore of Enagh Lough.In addition to farming their own food, the inhabitants here exploited the fish and fowl associated with a small lake.No names or even exact dates can be identied against these Bronze Age settlers of the Derry area.But we do know that they did exist, and that they began man’s first tentative exploitation and alteration of the local environment. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We are publishing extracts from the book. In this latest article, Brian examines what the local area was like in the Bronze Age.   One Autumn’s day in  a local farmer ploughing his hill-top field, overlooking the River Foyle, hooked a large flat stone, of dimensions  feet by  feet, and brought it to the surface.There it remained while the winter’s frosts worked to break up the soil.It was members of Shantallow Local History Society, out searching for flint fragments, the evidence of prehistoric settlement, who on coming across this large flat stone realised it was perhaps the capping stone of a Bronze Age grave.The Archaeological Branch of the Department of the Environment was called in, who, on one very wet March day in , carried out an emergency dig.Small village What they found convinced them that here in the townland of Shantallow, on the fringe of the present-day city of Derry, in the early years of the second millennium BC, lived a small village community of farmers who had trade connections with the flint-mining areas of County Antrim, and who in a nearby cemetery buried their dead.The stone which had lain undisturbed for some , years was, in fact, the capping stone of a cist tomb.Around , BC a circular pit,  to  feet deep, had been dug on the brow of a small hill,  feet above the River Foyle.In the middle of this pit slabs of stone had been laid on edge to create a stone box,  feet long by  feet wide.The corpse, with his or her knees folded up to its chest, had been placed in this coffin on its side.Rotted awayOnly part of the skull and part of the leg bone remained of this skeleton, as the rest of the body had rotted away through contact with the soil.Behind the neck of the corpse was an earthenware pot in the shape of a bowl and decorated with jagged imprints.This bowl had been made specically for the burial ceremony.It is clear that these people believed in some form of afterle, as the bowl would have been filled with food or drink to sustain the body after death in the journey through the underworld.The cist in which the corpse lay was then roofed with a capstone. In this case, as occurred on other sites, the grave wasn’t marked above the ground with a mound of earth.The farmer had inadvertently uncovered on this hill-top site a Bronze Age cemetery.Short cistThis distinctive form of burial, in a short cist with an upright bowl-shaped food vessel, is not unique to Ireland.It has been found all over Europe, even as far east as Russia. It represents the spread of the so-called Beaker peoples, named after their pottery, who originated in lands around the mouth of the Rhine, then spread to Northern Britain and from there to Ireland. Around the early years of the second millennium they had reached Shantallow.These people were settled pastoralists who introduced metal-working into Ireland.Near the cist in Shantallow fragments of flint, which is not a native rock of this area, were found, and the area of their greatest concentration marked the spot where a small community lived.Shantallow clearly supported a Bronze Age village.The flints were fashioned to be used as arrowheads and thumbscrapers.The arrowheads would have been used in hunting while the thumb-shaped flint scrapers would have been used in the preparation of animal skins before they were cured.Clothes would have been made from this leather.No metal artefacts were found, but in other cist burials hundreds of metal implements have been found.Ireland possessed abundant supplies of copper, and these people exploited in a large way Irish copper and gold, as evidenced by the metal axes, knives and daggers they left behind.Their most outstanding personal ornament was the sheet-gold lanula, a crescent-shaped neck ornament.The settlers at Shantallow were primarily livestock farmers.With their metal axes they would have begun to clear some of the surrounding forest to expose good pasture land. Here cattle were grazed for their beef.They would also have grown wheat, oats and barley, with the grain being ground on saddle-querns.Within an earth enclosure, perhaps topped with a palisade of timber stakes, the early inhabitants of Shantallow would have lived in small, single-room, circular wicker huts.Their houses were probably built of posts and wattle rods.Thin saplingsStrong posts were driven into the ground, and thin saplings of hazel, elm or ash were woven between them to form the walls. Then the walls were plastered with daub in which mud was mixed with straw.This mixture dried very hard to create a sturdy homestead.The roofs would have been thatched with straw or rushes obtained from marshy ground.Our early settlers at Shantallow would have only made a small impact on the forests which clothed this area.Only the hill top would have been cleared of wood.On a clear day, rising above the trees that swept down to the banks of the Foyle on both sides of the river, the early dwellers of Shantallow might have spotted, some two miles to the south-east across the river, smoke curling up from open hearths on Rough Island in Enagh Lough.FragmentsFinds of late Stone Age and Bronze Age pottery fragments on this island, lying almost in the middle of the lake, roughly circular in shape, with a diameter of  feet and now largely overgrown with trees and shrubs, identies this as a settlement site around the same time as the community of Shantallow were burying one of their members.This site on Enagh Lough, termed a crannog, was formed by a  of timber, overlain with a layer of packed stones almost  feet deep, being placed, timber by timber and stone by stone, on top of a marshy island created by glacial dumping during the last Ice Age.Bronze spearheads, flint flakes and abraded stones, worn away by man’s rubbing or scraping, attest to its settlement in prehistoric times.Around the edge of the crannog there may have been a defensive palisade of timber stakes with lighter branches of wattle woven in and out through them.Very similarThe houses inside, built of wicker, wattling and daub, and the lestyle would have been very similar to those at Shantallow.Barley, wheat and oat impressions found on the pottery fragments are evidence of the cultivation of these crops in fields around the shore of Enagh Lough.In addition to farming their own food, the inhabitants here exploited the fish and fowl associated with a small lake.No names or even exact dates can be identied against these Bronze Age settlers of the Derry area.But we do know that they did exist, and that they began man’s first tentative exploitation and alteration of the local environment. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We can still go out when we need to for groceries and the like, so there is no need to panic. Why not take the opportunity to binge on a few Netflix series . Our suggestions below arent necessarily suitable for younger viewers but will keep adults enthralled for sure. The Stranger Probably the top trending Netflix series so far this year and for good reason. Harlen Cobens latest creation shows a strange woman turn up in a British community to reveal the secrets of the inhabitants. The resultant human wrangling and mystery makes this one of those series where one more episode is never enough. The tying of those secrets together as the series unfolds reveals a lot more about the locals than they care to admit and uncovers a murky underbelly. This is a must-watch. googletag.cmd.push Marcella Anna Friel is exceptional in this Nordic-inspired British crime drama. She plays a run-ragged detective who finds herself central to the murder mysteries shes investigating. The edge-of-the-seat drama entailed in the unravelling of the story in each of the two stories is truly gripping. This is a well-acted and produced ITV drama that might have slipped under the radar for many. With two series and  episodes available on Netflix, there is plenty to binge on. Unforgotten Another ITV production starring the brilliant Nicola Walker. This series sees a team of detectives re-opening cold cases following the discovery of new information. They endeavour to reach back in time and across generations to dig up old evidence and connections. The result is another brilliantly gripping drama with a new story taking centre stage in each of the two series available on Netflix. It is fast-paced and written in a way that puts you in the investigation room, often shouting at the TV with nuggets of information youve spotted in previous episodes. A third series has aired but has not yet reached the streaming service. googletag.cmd.push Safe Another Harlen Coben creation which has seen an increase in traffic since the success of The Stranger, although Safe appeared on Netflix first last year. Coben specialises in writing a big story within the context of a small community and this is the ultimate example. A teenage girl goes missing from her home in a gated community, and her fathers desperate search brings him into a dark world. Suspicion falls on almost everyone and this series will have you second-guessing every word out of every characters mouth. The Trials Of Gabriel Fernandez This true-crime documentary is perhaps the most disturbing of these suggestions but is compelling viewing. It charts the story of nine-year-old Gabriel Fernandez and his gruesome death at the hands of his mother and her partner. The abuse he suffered sparks a wide-ranging investigation. That investigation and this series shines a light on something far more sinister and systematic than the abuse in Gabriels own home. It will make you feel very uneasy but you will not be able to stop watching, wide-eyed with shock.

So why not take the opportunity to watchsome classic films on Netflix. Our suggestions below arent necessarily suitable for younger viewers but will keep the adults entertained. Blade Runner A truly classic science fiction filmdirected byRidley Scott and starringHarrison Ford,Rutger HauerandSean Young. The Crying Game Neil Jordan’s  hit was a success at the time and it boasts one of the most surprising twists in the tail in any film. googletag.cmd.push GoodFellas Martin Scorsese’s  masterpiece is a must watch film about the Mafia with an all star cast including Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro. GroundhogDay A brilliant  comedy where Bill Murray relives the same day over and over again.... Funny and fitting for the situation we find ourselves in. Jaws A classic and the music alone makes it worth watching. The Silence of the Lambs Not one for the kids.... and probably not one for some adults either. T Four Weddings and a Funeral A rom-com starring Hugh Grant and a theme song that launched a thousand first dances at weddings. googletag.cmd.push When Harry Met Sally Famous for THAT scene and a cracking comedy all round The Le of Brian Once banned in this country, it is still hilarious to this day and signs off with a tune fitting for the times we are in now. Platoon Oliver Stones epic film about the Vietnam War has more than stood the test of time with an all star cast ofTom Berenger,Willem Dafoe,Charlie Sheen and Johnny Depp.  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Seven years later, he would be the first Maghera senior footballer to lt silverware after their MacLarnon Cup win over Omagh CBS. Back to back Ulster minor winner Laverty played on the Derry senior team of the mid-s, picking up two senior medals. His first cousin and godfather Colm Mulholland, who turned  in December played for Derry in the  All-Ireland final. Lavertys Derry senior debut came by chance. Jim McGuigan was organising the transport to Sligo for the opening game of the pre-Christmas section of the   league. googletag.cmd.push He asked Lavertyhe wanted to go to the game on the bus, just to watch. After all the ious pick up points passed, there were only  players on board, including Anthony McGurk who was nursing a sore ankle. “Do you want to play,” McGuigan asked in the direction of Laverty. Before he had a chance to reply, manager Paddy OHara told McGuigan to get him togs and socks a pair of boots from somewhere. “So there I was playing my first game. I remember the game was moved to Tobercurry, because of a waterlogged pitch. We won the game and remember Michael Kearns was playing for Sligo.” googletag.cmd.push It would be a further four years before he would make his championship debut. During that time, as a student at St Joes in Belfast, he won an All-Ireland Fresher medal and three Ryan Cupmedals. Regrettably, despite having a team capable of winning the Sigerson, the Ranch werent permitted to enter. With his native Lavey, he played for over  years, winning two championships, but for the last  years he calls Portrush his home. Every day, he will walk down the Coleraine Road to the shop, passing back over from County Antrim to his native Derry. He will pass the home of John Eddie Mullan, a league winner with the Oakleafers in , and the pair would often chat. Last week, when Lavertys phone rang and the opportunity arose to rake up the memories of  again, there was an excitement in his voice. Last year he had the thyear gathering of the  minor winning team that were defeated by Cork in All-Ireland final. “Brendan Kelly, Mickey Moran, Vincent Conway, Frankie McCotter and myself were on that team,” Laverty remembers. “The MacLarnon Cup final was a really good game of football compared to the MacRory which was dour and not very interesting.” Martin ONeill, who would later that year play alongside Laverty for Derry minors, played on the winning St Malachys team, managed by Phil Stuart, that lted the MacRory Cup. “Hugh Cudden, our goalkeeper, is now in Canada and Liam Harbinson is away in South Africa or Zimbabwe and Frankie McCotter lives in London.” Laverty scored one goal in the final with Harbinson, who played some Irish league soccer, notching the other, after dribbling clear of Omagh defence. “Liam is a relation of Sean OConnell and had a swagger like Sean OConnell. He was a very good soccer player, as was Mickey Moran. Playing in the school playground, you would know they had a bit of skill from soccer about them.” In those days, as Laverty remembers, organised games against other schools didnt come into vogue until third or fourth year. “What struck out for me, when we started in St Pats Maghera, there was only  pupils at it. We went into the assembly hall, there was no floor in it, we were standing on the grass as the school wasnt totally finished. “Frankie Kearney and Brian McKevitt took us in the early years. Then we had Sean Murphy and Eamon Small coaching us as well.” There were few highlights of the football in the early years but soon there was a greater enthusiasm and more boys were taking an interest. Frankie Kearney left the staff, going to St Pauls Kilrea. McKevitt went back to teach in the Abbey. Sean Murphy, with Jim B Bradley assisting him, took over the running of the senior team. “It was brilliant,” enthuses Laverty. “We were the first senior team and got Maghera into the MacRory. Adrian Boyle was still at Maghera the following year and remembers playing in the MacRory. “It was a fantastic feeling to win it and Omagh had a great team at that time. It was a ding dong game. We had a good team and were all very determined to win on that day.” Laverty was the captain and refers to manager Sean Murphys qualities in the classroom being transferred to the dressing room. “He was a good teacher and then he was a good manager as well. Everybody wanted to play for him. He had a good way of getting things across and he was a good motivator, you wanted to play for him.” Another ingredient for success, which Laverty mentions, was the school basketball team. Under the watch of Charlie Murphy, they won the Ulster title, with a - win over Methody. “It was up in San Souci Park, in Queens,” he adds, with the details floating down the phone-line asit were yesterday. There was a hiccup before the final. Maghera didnt have numbers on their vests and wouldnt be allowed to compete until a local intervention saved the day. St Colms Draperstowns U team were there and coach Seamus Kelly, loaned them their vests. Kelly, who passed away recently, would have an influence on Lavertys Derry career under Frankie Kearneys tenure. “Seamus was a shrewd man and was one of the mentors of Derry teams of ,  and . Sean OConnell would have been helping out with training – while still playing – and big Liam Hinphey was the motivator. Seamus Kelly was the tactician, he was very quiet but was shrewd operator.” “Methody came out in silk tops and togs, with all their fancy numbers. The vests we got were as tight as a fiddle string and too small for us. “There was a Methody boy who got a few tackles that day, that werent part of basketball, but thats another story,” added Laverty, with a hearty laugh. On the basketball starting team of five, were Mickey Moran and Eugene Laverty. Tommy McCloy of Lavey was another footballer but would leave school before the MacLarnon winning season. Also at the school during that era was current Lavey man Paddy Shivers, who went on to play for Derry as well. Laverty cant understand why Shivers wasnt on the Maghera team at that time. “I wasnt good enough,” Shivers has recently told Laverty. “He was a good footballer. He coached the team and played on the Lavey team for years. He was a PE teacher up in St Colms in Draperstown, took teams and did very well.” Laverty never forgot Shivers. He knew his footballers and, especially, a midfielder when he saw one. Winning captains names will continue to go up on the walls of St Patricks Maghera, but Eugene Laverty will always be the first. From the team on , who set the standard for others to follow. READ ALSO - Match report - Omagh - Maghera - Click here...

The scoreline didnt do the Derry kingpins justice, Their tremendous determination and work-rate was enough to see them overwhelm Errigal Ciaran. The Tones never really let the Tyrone champions get a snf of glory. They trailed by - to - at half-time, but that scoreline disguised the fact that they dominated possession in the first half despite battling against a huge wind. The problem was they couldnt score. They hit seven wides to Errigals three in the first half, missed an open goal chance after  minutes, and failed to capitalise on the fact that they won nearly twice as many frees in the opening half. googletag.cmd.push In contrast, the Errigal Ciaran attack, with Eamon McCaffrey at full-forward and Chris Quinn filling the vacant spot at centre-forward, feasted well on the few crumbs of possession they received. As expected, Bellaghy dispatched David ONeill to mark the legendary Peter Canavan at corner-forward. He looked to have his hands full when, after five minutes, The Great fired over a trademark point to open the scoring. But thereafter, Canavan rarely got the better of the Derry county defender who completely dominated him in the air. ONeill received some brilliant support, particularly from corner-back and man of the match Peter Diamond and half-backs Cathal Diamond, Ciaran McNally and Kevin Doherty. googletag.cmd.push Errigal still looked dangerous up front, their scant possession yielding brilliant points from Eoin Gormleyand Peter Loughran. Bellaghy were left wonderingtheyd rue the Louis McPeake fumble which cost them a great goal chance in the opening quarter, after Fergal Doherty and Cathal Scullion had combined to create the opening. Seamus Birts timely introduction of Joe Cassidy greatly increased their powers of penetration. Errigal Ciaran werent helped when driving rain and dimming light, with a . throw-in and a lack of floodlights. The Bellaghy forwards got braver when the second half began. Three superb long-range frees in as many minutes from Gavin Diamond gave them the confidence they needed to capitalise on their possession. Points from Francis Glackin and Cassidy saw them surge three points clear by the th minute. And with key men like Karl Diamond funnelling back to defend in packs, they kept the Tyrone champions scoreless for  minutes of the second half until Mark Hartes consolation goal in injury time. The hammer blow came in the thminute, with Bellaghys goal. Cassidy and Gavin Diamond combined to put Cathal Scullion through, unmarked, to score the goal that ended their losing run in finals.

Just last week, the Judges Road club were preparing for their All-Ireland League game with Sundays Well, hoping for a win which would take them away from relegation uncertainty and into a potential play-off position near the top of Division C. But the worldwide events of the past few days have not only ended sport locally, nationally and beyond, it has also put any game into context, with peoples lives at risk because of the spread of the Covid- virus.Rather than sit around and wait for the latest news however, City of Derry Head Coach Paul OKane, his staff and his players have made a public offer to go out into the community to help in anyway needed. OKane himself has already been out delivering groceries and prescriptions to the most vulnerable unable to travel in a bid to keep them safe during these uncertain times. “Its just something that we thought we would like to do,” he explained. “I spoke with the president and I spoke with the vice-chair of rugby, and there have been plenty of the players who have stuck their hands up. Were all at a bit of a loose end now and we know that theres vulnerable people out there and to be honest theres been a very good response. “Its certainly opened my eyes to how vulnerable in particular the old people are, even for simple things such as getting their shopping done or getting their prescriptions done and weve been out and about getting a few things done today. I think its just important we try and do something.”The importance of sport to the local community has never been more evident than in recent days with most sporting events and clubs taking a necessary step backwards. Sport however, can still give back, according to OKane.“Were really an extended family when you see how far and wide it reaches and people maybe dont realise that sometimes because were so erse,” he continued. “Were here for the whole community, were cross community, were cross-border and we have people involved in the club travelling from everywhere. “Its just important to try and help anyone we can, eventheyre not attached to the club, eventheyre just a part of the city or wider area. “We have players from Inishowen, Letterkenny, Strabane and Limavady, and from both sides of the water in Derry itself. We have footprints on every side of the community here. This is the least we can do for the wider rugby family in the city and the city in general.”It could be weeks or even months before the sporting calendar resumes, but in the meantime, OKane is hoping that the crisis will bring out the best of our community.“Its not just rugby because Im a Derry City fan and I try to get to every game I can,” he said. “Im from a gaelic background as well. I helped coach Doire Colmcille and Im originally a Limavady Wolfhound, so its great to see all those wee communities trying to do their bit, and were a part of that. “Were at a bit of a loss at what we do at the minute so we have to try and make the best of it and help whoever needs help and try to rally around. From a sporting point of view, you dont know what you have until youve lost it. “Its crazy how much it affects us, evenits sitting watching sport or going training. Some of the guys are going out of their mind because they cant train. Its been massively impactful and when we get back at it, I think we will appreciate things a lot more.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Our priority is protecting our people and saving lives, which is paramount. As an Executive, we are doing everything we can and will continue to do so in the days, weeks and months ahead but we all have a role to play to protect ourselves and others from Covid-.The Executive has also paid tribute to health service staff who are performing ldquoheroically during this unprecedented time.Mr Swann said the entire health service is under growing pressure and appealed to people not to add to it unless they had to.ldquoPlease, please be patient and treat our great staff with respect, said the health minister. ldquoThey are there to care for you you are their first concern. Please show them the same concern and consideration.The Executive has also taken the opportunity to urge the public to follow the public health advice which means continuing to wash hands regularly for at least  seconds and anyone with mild symptoms should stay at home they will not need to be tested.People are asked not to contact or go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or emergency department.

St Maryrsquos High School in the town is closed today only for an exceptional closure.Some schools are working to continue lessons for Year - students to prepare them for their forthcoming examinations but have asked that all other children are kept at home.Despite the current government advice to keep schools open, attendance is likely to be down from Wednesday onwards as worried parents keep children at home for their protection or other more vulnerable family members.Principal of St Patrickrsquos Primary School in Saul, Mr Mark McGrath, said: ldquoWe are open again on Wednesday but we fully respect parentsrsquo right to do what is best for their own family situation.Down High School is closed today for a school development day but is open tomorrow and Friday for Years - only. The school has cancelled a planned ski trip to Austria as well as a senior rugby tour to Seattle in the USSt Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick is also operating a similar arrangement and have asked pupils not to attend school this week.However, the schoolrsquos principal, Mr Joe McCann, has said that pupils facing exams, who need to leave in work or collect work from teachers, can come into school between am and am each day.Mr McCann also informed parents that its cleaning provider spent all of Monday cleaning the school in preparation for any pupils coming in today.The main impact of the coronavirus on most schools has been the cancellation of planned school trips and any after-school activities.Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch was forced to cancel three school trips which were due to start last Saturday.One of the trips was a ski holiday to Folgaria in northern Italy, the worst affected area of the country.Over  of the schoolrsquos best Irish dancers, singers and musicians were to take in New Yorkrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade and a concert. A ten-day trip to South Africa has also been cancelled by the school.Mr Peter Dobbin, principal, told parents that the schoolrsquos primary duty of care was to ldquothe health and safety and to the wellbeing of each and every student and member of staff.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and we are navigating unchartered waters, so please bear with us as we try to ensure that we maintain learning and teaching at this time, said Mr Dobbin.He said that he and his staff were also preparing for ldquoan inevitable school closure in due course and would ensure that no external visitors, including parents, would be allowed past the entrance foyer, unless it was under ldquoexceptional circumstances.He revealed that the school had implemented ldquoenhanced cleaning procedures since the beginning of the month.The school has also cancelled all extra-curricular activities and postponed the Year  and Year  parent teacher meetings, scheduled for next Tuesday.Mr Kevin Lambe, principal of Shimna Integrated College, Newcastle, confirmed on Monday that the schoolrsquos sky trip to Austria had been cancelled.Outlining his schoolrsquos response to the current coronavirus threat level, Mr Lambe said that additional cleaning protocols were in place and that all evening activities involving community groups had been cancelled until further notice.He added: ldquoOur current priority is to put in place arrangements to support studentsrsquo continued learning and revision should schools close..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Cemetery.jpg","title":"Cemetery blaze report due out  ","story":"POLITICIANS will be provided with an update on the recent blaze which ripped through part of a building at Struell cemetery in Downpatrick.The blaze mdash which is believed to have been started by an electrical fault ndash has left Newry, Mourne and Down Council with a repair bill running into tens of thousands of pounds.The Fire and Rescue Service carried out a detailed examination of the building in the aftermath of the blaze and members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee are expected to discover its initial findings tomorrow night.Mechanical equipment, including a small digger, was destroyed in the blaze at the Old Course Road cemetery three weeks ago, with firefighters able to prevent flames from spreading to a toilet block which remains operational.The cemetery was temporarily closed by local authority officials in the wake of the fire but was subsequently reopened. Council insurers also visited the site to inspect the scale of the damage.The roof of the cemetery building which was badly affected by the fire contained asbestos tiles which resulted in debris falling within the structure and on ground immediately beside it.Council staff erected fencing around the damaged part of the building to prevent access to the asbestos material with arrangements made to remove it off site by an approved asbestos contractor.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said politicians will be keen to hear tomorrowrsquos update and how soon the main building will be fully operational.

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our communities.Other councillors who spoke at Monday nightrsquos debate included Roisin Mulgrew, Michael Savage, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold

Fountain Foodbank has launched a new drive through facility in response to the coronavirus epidemic.The cross-community facility mdash which has seen an upsurge in demand over recent days and handed out almost  food parcels last week mdash introduced the new service this week in the wake of Mondayrsquos advice from Prime Minister Boris Johnston that people should avoid all ldquonon essential contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the helm of the foodbank since it opened and described the impact of the coronavirus issue on the community as ldquochallenging.She also confirmed that the volunteers who provide the food parcel service are committed to continuing to help others across the community in need.She described the climate the foodbank is currently operating in as ldquodficult and revealed that it was extremely busy last Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

The distance is approximately six miles on an out and back course, majority of the race on the flat with a brutal climb of  feet in half a mile.A new registration venue meant a slight course change which avoided the road section, crossing a few fields and down a lane that took competitors back onto the river path.Leading out the runners was Newcastle ACrsquos Seamus Lynch and Mourne Runnersrsquo Johnny Scott.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll.

There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Fear and uncertainty is widespread throughout this community,” she said.“There will be a long term impact on the mental and economic health of the citizens of this City and Borough but the measures we have enacted so far are within the scope of our organisation.”Members then heard from the Chief Executive, Roger Wilson who reminded elected representatives of their duties in a time of crisis.“We are Council, we are the form of government closest to its citizens and, as civic leaders, we need to lead our community through this,” he said.“We are not the only people who have a role in this but we need to make sure we are all pulling in the one direction.“Many people are scared and are looking for information. Speaking to many of you, I know that you are being inundated by people looking for help and I would seek members approval to make decisions quickly as things are moving at a very fast pace.“There willbe a big impact on our communities mental well being and health and that is a challenge we will all have to face. We need to accept that and find a way to support our community.”The motion to support Council’s ongoing approach to thecoronavirus situation was proposed by Councillor Paul Berry and seconded by Councillor Sam Nicholson.Speaking after the motion was passed Sinn Fein’s Catherine Nelson thanked Council staff and officials for their tireless work and implored Council to consider using its cash reserves to help the local community through this crisis.“The rule book goes out the window at a time like this,” she said on behalf of her party.“Big decisions will need to be made and time will be no friend of ours. We give the Chief Executive and senior management team our full support. We have trust and faith in you.“I would ask for an imaginative and exhaustive approach. We don’t have to try and reinvent the wheel but we should be mindful of the mental health of our citizens and think about what we can do to help them.“We should think of walks, the appropriate use of our open spaces, drive in cinemas and even the use of our reserve fund to help those in need.“We talk about saving the reserves for a rainy day, we will never get a rainier day than what we are about to experience.”Her sentiments were echoed by independent Councillor Paul Berry who also urged Council to do what it could to keep businesses informed.“I would request that the information is kept flowing daily,not hourly because the message from businesses is clear, very few of them have more than a very short space of time to go.“Urgent intervention is required as we speak.It is important we try and keep SMEs and large businesses up to date on a daily basis to encourage them to try and hang in there.”The Ulster Unionist Party’s Julie Flaherty also urged Council to unite for the good of the community.“This is a time when we need to come together like never before,” she said.“We need to maximise the community response. We also want to extend our thanks to the Chief Executive and senior officials. You have our full support and we will strive to keep people informed.“The impact of this will be felt in our communityfor a long time and the UUP, along with this council, will be at the forefront of this issue.”The Alliance Party’s Peter Lavery also outlined his party’s support for the Chief Executive and said now is the time to set aside political dferences in order to protect le.“We look forward to hearing how we can help support local businesses,” said Cllr Lavery.“Council will play a strong role in lobbying central government on behalf of our community and we all know this situation will get worse before it gets better.“We must do all we can to support our community.”Democratic Unionist Party colleagues, DarrynCausby and Steven Moutray also extendedtheir appreciation to the Chief Executive, senior management team and all Council staff for their efforts.“Thistsunami is sweeping across the world and it will have a negative effect on our businesses,” said Cllr Moutray.“We need to know what we can do to help them and we, as councillors, will ensure that everyone is made aware of the help on offer.”Cllr Causby commended Cllr Nelson for her suggestion on using Council funds.“I would like to say that the idea of a community fund already mentioned by Catherine Nelson is something we should look at going forward,” he said.“As we move forward in this very dficult environment, we will work as best we can to take the dficult decisionsand provide support to those who need it.”The SDLP’s Thomas O’Hanlon also thanked the Chief Executive and the senior managementteam but warned that bigger decisions would need to be made in the near future.“Our community face very dficult times, they are scared and frightened, just as we all are.None of us are medical experts but it is a civic leaders duty to be calm and measured and ensure we respond with compassion.“We will get through this. Roger, you have made timely decisions so far and you will have more to make but you have our support.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most
