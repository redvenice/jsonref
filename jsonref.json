That’s what this competition is about.’He added: ‘You take it to dizzy heights that stirs emotion.’And stir emotion it did.And the response was amazing.When announcing the three finalists, David, Kenny and Nawamin viewers were floored once more when John nearly teared up a second time.The heightened emotions had everyone on edge, it seemed, when one viewer said: ‘John Torode getting emotional when announcing the Masterchef final three nearly broke me.’If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/concordia-header.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"5 worst things happened friday 13th","story":"Luxury cruise ship Costa Concordia overturned after hitting an Italian reef on Friday 13th (Picture: AP PhotoGregorio Borgia)Friday 13th is not a day to be messed with, and we’re not just saying that because we’re wimps.History offers plenty of evidence that bad things happen on this doom-laden date, some of them so bad that they’ve fanned the flames of the world’s oddest superstition.And while the origin of this strange date is not crystal clear, its ‘effects’ have had an irreparable, negative impact on people’s lives.So without further ado, here are the five (listing the top 13 is not advisable today) worst things that have happened on Friday 13th.On Friday 13 October 1972, a plane full of Uruguayan rugby players crashed into the snowy Chilean mountains.Only 27 of the original 45 passengers survived, and without supplies, those still alive had to eat their dead teammates.A few weeks later, an avalanche killed eight more. The 16 remaining survivors were not rescued until the end of December. Grim.And on the same day of that plane crash, October 13, a plane in Moscow crashed into the ground, killing all 174 on board.On Friday 13 January 2012, a huge cruise ship called the Costa Concordia capsized off the Tuscan coast near Isola del Giglio after it struck a reef and began to tilt.Thirty-two people died (and possibly more due to the fact some unregistered people were aboard). The captain of the ship was found guilty of manslaughter for not evacuating passengers properly.The cost of the rescue and clear-up was £1.4 billion, more than three times the £430 million construction bill for the ship.On Friday 13 March 1964, 28-year-old Kitty Genovese was brutally raped and murdered in front of a New York block of flats.The crime is infamous because according to reports, more than 30 people witnessed the crime at their windows, without one person intervening or calling the police.This event gave its name to the psychological phenomena Genovese syndrome (aka bystander effect), which happens when people fail to do the right thing if they’re in a crowd.On Friday 13 November 1970, a cyclone hit Bangladesh, causing a tidal wave and eventually killing around 500,000 people.Livestock were wiped out, as were crops in hundreds of fields, meaning the disaster also caused mass starvation for a long period afterwards.Friday 13 1939 saw the beginning of the worst bushfire in history, now known as the Black Friday bushfires.In Victoria, Australia, almost 20,000 km² (nearly 5 million acres) of land was turned to ash, 1,300 home were burned down and 71 people died.Several towns were totally destroyed, and three quarters of the state of Victoria was affected, giving the appearance that the whole area had been cursed during the blaze.MORE: Arctic Monkeys tickets are released this morning – when, where and at what price?MORE: Is the new God of War game open world?"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_7247783.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"man caught skinning husky dog park sell meat doner kebabs","story":"He said he was planning on selling the meat to a kebab shop (Picture: east2west news)A man was caught butchering and skinning a husky dog to reportedly sell the meat to kebab shops.He was arrested after a group of teenagers witnessed the shocking scene, alerting police in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk.He told police: ‘When I lived in Kazakhstan, there were a lot of dogs, and it was normal to cook the meat on a barbecue and eat them.’He confessed: ‘I used a wire to strangle the dog.He had strung up the carcass on a wall (Picture: east2west news)‘I was given the animal as payment for a job.’After one night in the cells he was released and returned to the scene to try and collect the dog’s carcass, which he had strung up on a wall.He was stopped by animal activists.He had killed ‘hundreds of dogs’ in the city and sold the meat to a ‘fast food kebab takeaway chain’, he told the campaigners.A source said the man could be deported back to Kazakhstan."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/182004052-e1523614559943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;h=506\u0026amp;crop=1\" alt=\"Penis size shouldn\u0027t be fair game when it comes to insults\" class=\"img-align-none alignnone wp-image-6751850 size-large\" data-rewritten=\"true","title":"penis size shouldnt fair game comes insults","story":"(Picture: Ella BYworth for usThis morning I noticed that some truly terrible person had tweeted something truly terrible. ‘Bitch if you’re dressed half naked in public, don’t get mad wen i touch your body without your consent cuz i believe that’s wat you wants’ wrote this bloke on Twitter.Now, as you can imagine, I was frothing at the mouth. What a vile sentiment. How desperately outdated and slut shaming and generally ignorant. Unsurprisingly, the replies to the tweet shared a general consensus. The man who wrote it was a nasty person.But you know what else the majority of the replies had in common?Speculation about his penis.People said he didn’t have a penis, that his penis was tiny, that he didn’t know how to use his penis. Balls were a feature too. Small balls, shriveled balls, tiny balls.How did we arrived at a place where the default response to a person saying something ignorant and untrue is to insult a part of their anatomy?Because in a world where we find ourselves arguing with complete strangers on the internet, we have to grapple for insults that sting. Which, when it comes to men, means penis comments.Both physically and emotionally, if you want to hurt a man, you aim between the legs. Almost every man I’ve ever dated has been insecure about the size of his penis, wishing that it was longer.Men are taught their entire life that their worth, their power and their prowess stems from the size of their sexual organs.It doesn’t seem to matter that most women only have a four inch deep vagina, or that women are for the most part spectacularly disinterested in balls (big balls are fine, small balls are fine, we honestly do not care about balls).Despite extensive research and writing that demonstrates the opposite, men are forced to regard the size of their genitalia as the most important aspect of their sexual abilities and a defining characteristic as a man. So it’s no surprise that it’s the first weapon we reach for in our internet argument arsenal.I know how tempting it is. I’ve done it myself. We all remember the moment in Notting Hill where Julia Roberts tells a group of astonished wankers ‘I’m sure you didn’t mean any harm, I’m sure it was just friendly banter, I’m sure you guys have dicks the size of peanuts. Enjoy your dinner, the tuna’s really good.’(Photo by Ulrich Baumgarten via Getty Images)But in a world where we stand against body shaming, I’m afraid I think we have to stop. For two reasons, really.Firstly, because it’s lazy. When someone is talking trash on the internet, or in real life, we should do better than throwing a lazy penis comment their way. We should dismantle their argument, or we should ignore them.Secondly, body shaming isn’t nice and it isn’t okay. It’s the same as when people call Katie Hopkins ugly. You might think that she’s a terrible person, that she insights racial hatred or that she’s a terrible example to her children. But the lack of symmetry in her face isn’t symmetrical is not relevant.Men worry about their penis size. Men are self conscious about it. For some men it ruins their sex lives, leaves them feeling depressed and can be part of wider mental health issues. Talking about small penises as if they’re the end of the world or something you should be ashamed of only makes that problem worse.People’s terrible opinions and horrible comments are bad because they’re bad. Not because of the body that they came from. When we focus on the latter we are distracted from the former, and we lose the moral high ground.How does it feel to have synaesthesia? Meet the people whose senses blend*I mean, it’s arguing on the internet, it’s very unlikely. But hey, a girl can dream.MORE: Woman murdered by one night stand after she joked about his small penisMORE: The 5 worst things that have happened on Friday 13th"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/09/17/4A5E4E4300000578-5595315-image-a-15_1523291174738.jpg","title":"Chloe Moretzs parents declared bankruptcy debts 5 487 891","story":"    Chloe Moretz\u0027s family lost everything when her parents declared bankruptcy in 2005, DailyMail.com can reveal.

He should have had the decency to refer himself rather than sweep this under the carpet.\u0027But the long-standing Health Secretary has got the backing of No10  as he has not breached the Ministerial Code of Conduct.Last night No 10 said: \u0027Jeremy has rightly apologised for an administrative oversight, and as the Cabinet Office have made clear there has been no breach of the Ministerial Code. We consider the matter closed.\u0027But a former MPs\u0027 watchdog said that if Mr Hunt did not \u0027face consequences\u0027 it could create a \u0027perception of double standards\u0027, with \u0027one rule for the political elite and another rule for the rest of the population\u0027.          Mr Hunt\u0027s breaches relate to seven flats he bought in the Ocean Village complex in Southampton (pictured) in FebruarySir Alistair Graham, a former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, told the Daily Telegraph, which revealed the oversight: \u0027It is a very poor show when ministers, who you expect to take leadership in standards ... do not meet the rules they are required to meet.\u0027If there has been a failure of leadership, there should be a political price for it. Either in terms of the damage to your reputation or to action by the Prime Minister in the case of the Ministerial Code, or by the Committee on Standards.\u0027Mr Hunt\u0027s breaches relate to seven flats he bought in the Ocean Village complex in Southampton in February. The average price paid for properties in the development is £240,000 per flat, according to Zoopla.          The oversight is a criminal offence punishable by a fine or up to two years in prisonThe mortgages were issued by a private bank to Mare Pond Properties Limited, a company set up by Mr Hunt and his wife Lucia Guo. Miss Guo was the only person named in the registration documents filed at Companies House when the firm was incorporated in September 2017. Mr Hunt appears to have breached the Companies Act on two counts. He should have declared to Companies House he was a \u0027person with significant control\u0027 within 28 days of registration. But he did not do so for six months.Legislation passed by the Tories in 2016 made this compulsory for anyone who has more than 25 per cent of shares or voting rights in a company. The law was a central part of the Government\u0027s plan to tackle money laundering, and failure to comply is an offence punishable by a fine or up to two years in prison.The second breach relates to the fact Mr Hunt\u0027s name was omitted from the registration document – a criminal offence under another section of the Companies Act. Parliamentary rules state MPs must register any shareholding greater than 15 per cent in any company within 28 days. But Mr Hunt took nearly five months to do so, registering his co-ownership of the company alongside the purchase of the flats in the Register of MPs\u0027 Interests on March 7.He told the Telegraph the breaches were down to an honest mistake by his accountant and that he had corrected the listing after being alerted to it by a member of the public on March 28.           Mr Hunt has not breached the Ministerial Code of Conduct with the Ocean Village breach, according to Cabinet Office rules, and so retains the backing of Theresa MayHis spokesman said: \u0027These were honest administrative mistakes which have already been rectified. \u0027Jeremy\u0027s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing which was a genuine oversight.\u0027The Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code. Jeremy declared the interest to them after the company was set up. \u0027They advised that as it was a shell company with no assets or value, it should only be registered when it became operational. \u0027As such, Jeremy presumed the same rules applied to Parliamentary declarations ... Jeremy accepts these mistakes are his responsibility and has apologised to the parliamentary authorities.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/04/4B19998A00000578-0-image-a-26_1523591770915.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle Chicago airport incognito finalize UK visa","story":"    Meghan Markle landed in Chicago\u0027s O\u0027Hare International Airport on Thursday morning to finalize her UK visa application          She was spotted walking through the airport in a White Sox baseball cap in an attempt to remain incognitoOne source said that Chicago police provided security for Meghan but did not give her an actual escort as she went through the airport. According to TMZ, Meghan entered the VFS Global UK Visa Application Centre in Chicago Thursday to finalize her application after she landed in the city. Meghan is set to attend key Commonwealth Youth Forum event...Meghan Markle is blasted by her sister for \u0027inviting...Share this articleThe entire process took about 10 minutes where staff cleared the office for her while she filled out the paperwork. Meghan reportedly paid an estimated $1,500 or more to have the visa expedited so she can receive in the next couple of days. This comes just one month before she is due at the alter to marry Prince Harry. They are scheduled to be wed at Windsor Castle on May 19 and more than 2,500 people have been invited to attend the event. The future wife to Prince Harry appears to be crossing some to-do items off her list before the ceremony.             Meghan reportedly had the Chicago visa office cleared out so she could finalize her visa.

In 1955, the Catholic Church dedicated the day to Saint Joseph the Worker and during the Cold War, May Day was marked with large military parades in the Red Square of the Soviet Union.When is Labour Day 2018?In the UK, after being introduced by Michael Foot, the then-Employment Secretary in 1978, Labour Day is celebrated on May Day and is marked as a spring bank holiday.As the bank holiday is always held on the first Monday in May and May Day falls on a Tuesday in 2018, the day will be marked on Monday, May 7, 2018.Although there are many traditional May Day rites that have existed for hundreds of years, May Day was not linked to International Workers’ Day until the 20th century and is not known officially as Labour Day in the UK.Where are the 2018 International Workers’ Day protests?Since the 2000s, anti-capitalist movements have held a number of protests across the UK that have resulted in clashes with the police. Most notably, in 2000, a statue of Winston Churchill was given a grass Mohawk hairstyle and the Cenotaph in London was defaced.In London, the May Day 2018 march will be held on Tuesday, May 1 and will see protestors assemble on Clerkenwell Green and walk to Trafalgar Square for a rally. Find out more information here.When is International Workers’ Day celebrated in other countries?In the US, more commonly known as Labor Day, is celebrated on the first Monday of September each year after becoming an official federal holiday in 1894.Most other countries hold their International Workers’ Days on May 1, apart from Bosnia and Herzegovina who celebrate on May 1 and May 2.

Temperatures on Wednesday will again be highest in the South East. London could see between 20C and 23C.             \u0027And in fact, going further north, places like York could see 18C to 20c. And, even for Glasgow, it could be 17C or 18C on Wednesday.\u0027Ms Kent said: \u0027The trend into the end of the week is to continue this feed of warmer continental air across England and Wales. \u0027Those frontal systems are always trying to battle into the north-west, so it could be cloudier there with some more mixed weather at times.\u0027But, by the end of the week, in the that far south-eastern corner we could see temperatures into the low to mid-20s.\u0027Ms Kent said that these temperatures will be above the average for mid April. She said London will normally expect to see levels of 55F (13C) to 57F (14C) at this time of year with an average of 54F (12C) to 55F (13C) normal for southern England.The Met Office said Saturday is likely to be the best day of the coming weekend, with temperatures reaching the mid to high teens in some places.But Sunday will see rain at times across much of Britain as the country braces itself for the sun to come. European forecasters are predicting temperatures around the 70F (21C) mark for Malaga, Rome and Athens next week."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/04/09/4ACF475B00000578-0-image-m-39_1522830633728.jpg","title":"Lawyer worshipped father 75 realised sleeping au pair 28","story":"    Paul David was aged 70 when he married Jobeth Daguio (both are pictured at their wedding) to the outrage of his daughter A millionaire lawyer is locked in a legal battle with her elderly father over her dead mother\u0027s assets after she found the pensioner was sleeping with his daughter\u0027s au-pair.City solicitor Audra Wamsteker, 49, had enjoyed a \u0027close bond\u0027 with father Paul David, \u0027promised to look after him until his dying day\u0027 and \u0027thought of him like a god\u0027, a court was told. But that was before she discovered the 75-year-old had been sleeping with her au-pair since she was 28, branding the relationship with the nanny to her two children \u0027unthinkably repugnant\u0027.The pensioner was 70 when he married \u0027live-in nanny\u0027 Jobeth Daguio, who was aged 28 at the time, five years after the death of Mrs Wamsteker\u0027s mother. They now have two young children.The relationship between father and daughter has now fractured so badly they are facing each other across a courtroom, arguing over ownership of a flat in London, a house in Surrey, cash from four properties in the USA and 23 items of jewellery which belonged to Mrs Wamsteker’s dead mother, said to be worth about £1million in total.Judge Simon Monty QC, at Central London County Court, heard that Mrs Wamsteker, who lives in Canary Wharf, East London, has been practicing law in London for 17 years and previously worked for accounting giants Ernst and Young.Her father, who lives in Stratford, East London, told the court that he is also a qualified lawyer.The pair had always been close in their personal and financial lives, sharing a mutually \u0027loving and generous\u0027 relationship as the family built up a portfolio of properties across London, the USA and Malaysia.But that was before rows over their respective choice of partners following the death of Mrs Wamsteker’s mother - Mr David’s first wife - in 2008, tore the family apart.When her widowed father \u0027formed an attachment to and subsequently married\u0027 her  nanny, Mrs Wamsteker \u0027objected strongly to the relationship, describing it as ‘unthinkably repugnant’, the judge was told.Britney Spears and Will.i.am lose legal battle against...Tiger Woods embroiled in legal battle with his ex-girlfriend...Share this articleThe pensioner accepted that he \u0027doesn’t like\u0027 his daughter’s husband, 52-year-old investment director Adrianus Wamsteker, but denied accusations that he had previously threatened him with an axe.The father and daughter’s dislike of each other’s partners, and particularly Mr David’s marriage to her au pair, \u0027has resulted in the wholesale breakdown of the close relationship between them,\u0027 Mrs Wamsteker’s barrister, Desmond Kilcoyne, told the judge.\u0027The existing litigation is now motivated by a high degree of animosity by Mr David towards his daughter and particularly her husband,\u0027 he added.The English properties at stake in the case are a four-bedroom detached bungalow in Salisbury Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, previously marketed for £740,000, and a flat in Selsdon Road, West Ham, East London, worth about £275,000.Mr David says that he is the \u0027beneficial owner\u0027 of both properties - despite them being in his daughter’s name - having stumped up the deposits for them both and either \u0027funded\u0027 or made \u0027contributions\u0027 to their mortgages.          Audra Wamsteker, 49, and her husband Adrianus Wamsteker are pictured outside court as she battles her father for her dead mother\u0027s jewellery and international property portfolio As well as a declaration that he owns the properties, Mr David wants his daughter to pay him around £150,000 in rent for having \u0027excluded\u0027 him from the house and the flat since 2013.He also claims he paid for four properties in Florida which were sold in 2014 and is now \u0027entitled to the proceeds of sale\u0027, which Mrs Wamsteker currently holds.Finally Mr David is demanding his daughter return to him 23 items of his late first wife’s jewellery.Mr Kilcoyne, for Mrs Wamsteker, told the judge that she denies her father has ever owned any of the properties.She also refuses to give up her late mother’s jewellery as she says it was \u0027a gift\u0027 by her father before their relationship broke down.Mr David, who is representing himself and is backed by his son Alvin - also a qualifed lawyer - told the judge from the witness box that the jewellery, along with a box of her deceased mother’s clothes, \u0027were not given to her, but taken to her house for safekeeping\u0027.Mr Kilcoyne pointed to emails he said proved the gift had been made, in one of which Mr David told his daughter: \u0027It’s no use keeping something you’ve been given by someone you hate so bitterly.\u0027But Mr David told the judge he gave Mrs Wamsteker only one item - \u0027a gold chain with pearls on it\u0027 - plus another item to her daughter, and she had wrongfully kept the rest.Mr Kilcoyne told Mr David: \u0027There have been a number of arrangements between you and your daughter, at the end of which arrangements she owns property. You gave that jewellery to her and now you want it back.\u0027\u0027Nothing has been given away,\u0027 he responded.Telling the judge about the close relationship he used to enjoy with his daughter, Mr David said: \u0027She told me, mummy made me swear that I’d look after you to your dying day.’Mr Kilcoyne agreed there used to be a \u0027very close bond\u0027 between them, adding: \u0027You said your daughter thinks of you like a god.\u0027But there had been a darker side to their relationship, the barrister claimed.\u0027There’s an aspect of the relationship where she has felt unable to say no to you...she says you used to badger her for money...you felt entitled to ask her for money. You demanded money, you badgered her for money,\u0027 he put to Mr David.The pensioner denied the allegations saying: \u0027She makes me look like some sort of gangster...I look like a horrible man standing here.\u0027I still love both my children,\u0027 he told the judge.Mr Kilcoyne also alleged that Mr David had threatened his daughter’s husband with an axe. \u0027You told her you would destroy her and kill her husband,\u0027 he said. Mr David replied: \u0027No. The axe was in my bedroom drawer. If I had approached him with an axe like she says, I would have hurt him. That’s true I dislike him. I don’t deny it, I don’t like him.\u0027I realised what he was when he married my daughter in 2004. She’s got a very greedy husband,\u0027 he told the judge.Alvin David, Mrs Wamsteker’s brother and Mr David’s son, who lives in New Maldon with his family, outside court valued the property, jewellery and money claims being brought by his father against his sister at around £1m. The hearing continues. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/08/04D7E4AB000007D0-0-image-m-5_1523518559531.jpg","title":"Horrific moment female worker","story":"\u0027Guardian angel\u0027: Alexander Vysotsky is being hailed as a hero in Russia after he stepped in to save 28-year-old Ekaterina, right, from an \u0027attempted rape\u0027 The footage shows the victim bravely resisting, backing away towards the door and even grabbing the blade of the knife.He is seen forcing her  to the ground and pulling at her skirt. We\u0027ve got a dossier too!

It is different from having more than one spouse, which is illegal in Britain.Since speaking out Mrs Crumpton has been left in tears by hundreds of supportive messages from people praising her for talking openly about her unusual lifestyle.But she added that she has also faced a plethora of abusive messages, with some people sending her private messages saying: \u0027You should kill yourself\u0027.Mrs Crumpton admitted there have also been \u0027a few guys sending me pictures of their penis, saying \u0027Do you want me to be number five?\u0027But she said the abuse \u0027doesn\u0027t matter\u0027, and had been outweighed by the positive comments - with some people approaching her in the street to give her a high five.Barber to the stars who cut Trump\u0027s hair for 30 years says...\u0027The higher I go, the closer I am to him in heaven\u0027:...Share this articleMrs Crumpton is standing as a Green Party councillor in the local elections next month, and admitted the exposure from the interview could help her attract votes.But she told how the interview actually was carried out two months ago, before she had decided to stand for the council which is \u0027almost 100 per cent Labour\u0027.She has sided with the Green Party, which passed a motion at its autumn 2017 conference, officially recognising the validity of polyamorous relationships. And Mrs Crumpton said: \u0027One of the things I like about the Greens is they are an inclusive party that respect ersity.\u0027There still a lot of prejudice and judgement about people in polyamorous relationships. I can\u0027t legally marry more than one person.\u0027            The 44-year-old therapist practices polyamory. She is pictured with her husband TimShe pointed out her concerns over being in a polyamorous relationship when she has to write a will or be asked for a single next of kin in hospital.Mrs Crumpton added: \u0027It\u0027s not yet a protected characteristic, but somebody, your employer, could sack you if they found you were in multiple relationships.\u0027She said she used to be a teacher in a Catholic school, and could have been sacked if she was in a polyamorous relationship while there.And she now wants a change in the law \u0027so that nobody will fear being discriminated against for their polyamorous lifestyle\u0027.She is also pushing for improvements in social housing and an increase in policing levels on the street, as she stands for the elections on May 3. Asked how many people practice polyamory in Britain, she said: \u0027It\u0027s a lot more than you would think. There are polyamorous social groups all across the country.\u0027Mrs Crumpton said there are \u0027hundreds of people at conventions\u0027, and \u0027a lot of people go to a Facebook group but only if it\u0027s really locked down\u0027. She continued: \u0027I stood in the local election three years ago just as an independent candidate. In local councils I think it\u0027s about a person, not a party.\u0027I\u0027m a member of the Green Party and they said would I be willing to stand for them, and I said yes as I support them.\u0027Manchester Council is almost 100 per cent Labour. I\u0027m a socialist and I don\u0027t have a problem with that, but what I have a problem with is there\u0027s no alternative voice, so I think it would be beneficial for the council to have that.             The former teacher said she now wants a change in the law \u0027so that nobody will fear being discriminated against for their polyamorous lifestyle\u0027\u0027There are certain issues around social housing, despite being a Labour council, could be better, so that\u0027s something I would look to pressure on if I was elected.\u0027Earlier this week, the former teacher described what life is like and how she began exploring having more than one partner at the age of 29.She said: \u0027I was brought up in quite a traditional home. I had boyfriends and was monogamous. Having more than one partner never crossed my mind.\u0027In my twenties I got married and settled down in Chorlton fully intending to be with my husband for life. At the time I didn\u0027t really question having just one partner.\u0027It was normal. I did sometimes have feelings for other people, but I felt guilty about doing so and just took it as a sign that I didn\u0027t love my husband enough. \u0027When the marriage didn\u0027t work out, I met someone else, and started a monogamous relationship with him.\u0027The idea that loving more than one person might not make me a terrible human being only dawned on me when, at a pub, I bumped into a person who had more than one partner.\u0027I had never come across it before, or the term \u0027polyamory\u0027 which means \u0027more-than-one love\u0027. I was quite shocked, and curious about how it all worked for them.\u0027My partner was with me when I met the polyamorous person, and he was curious about it too. At the time neither of us considered it for ourselves, but I think the seed had been planted.\u0027A couple of years later, in 2003, I suggested to him that perhaps we might try an open relationship. I was interested to explore the possibility of allowing myself to love more than one person.             Mrs Crumpton said her husband Tim (pictured together) and fiancé are friends\u0027I think for him it was more about the thought of more than one sexual partner. We were both curious to see how it could work for us.\u0027I took to it immediately. I had a friend that I was already close to and that friendship drifted very naturally into something more. My partner had a similar experience with a friend of his. It was a revelation to me.\u0027I quickly realised that I had been \u0027wired up\u0027 this way probably all my life - loving more than one person now seems like the most natural thing in the world to me and I can\u0027t imagine being any other way. \u0027For me, it is all about love. Of course, some of my relationships have been sexual, but sex is not the driving force for me.\u0027I am no longer with the partner that I first explored polyamory with, though he and I remain close friends, and he has continued to be polyamorous.\u0027I married one of the people I first dated polyamorously. My husband, Tim, who is 43, and I got together in 2004 and were married in 2013 at Manchester Museum under the Tyrannosaurus Rex.\u0027I have a partner, John, 53, who I have been with since 2011, and who I am planning to \u0027marry\u0027 this year. We can\u0027t legally marry, but we are having a full wedding-style commitment ceremony at Chorlton Unitarian church in May.\u0027Both men are heterosexual and have been brought together through Mrs Crumpton. They have all lived together since 2015.Mrs Crumpton has another two other partners, Michael, who she has been with since 2016 and James.She said: \u0027John has been living with me and my husband in our house in Chorlton since 2015.             Tim (pictured) was one of the first people that she had a polyamorous relationship with\u0027He has a flat a few streets away from my house and I usually stay over at his place once or twice a week, and sometimes he stays at mine. Michael spent Christmas with us and we had a really special day together.\u0027Last but not least, I am with James, 73, who I bonded with while watching football games in the pub together in 2015. My husband and John have no interest in football, so it is nice to have someone to share that interest with.\u0027One of the lovely things about a life with more than one partner is that there is no pressure on one person to supply all my needs.\u0027My husband Tim and I share an enthusiasm for environmentalism and all that entails, like electric cars, and veganism. With my fiancé John I enjoy watching science-fiction and we go to church together.\u0027With Michael, I like to watch and support him playing for his local darts team at the Royal Oak, and we go to karaoke nights - which is possibly more embarrassing than admitting to polyamory!\u0027Living in a house with more than one partner is something I have done for a number of years now. I suppose in many ways it is no different from living in a shared house with a group of friends, or family.\u0027All the usual things about whose turn it is to wash up etc. Tim and John get on well, I suppose a bit like brothers, going on bicycle rides together for example. So it seems to work okay.\u0027They have something in common in that they both love me of course, and friends joke that I need two of them to keep me in-line.\u0027Like in any relationship, insecurities can arise. Though in some ways there is less jealousy perhaps - no fear that a partner might cheat on me because why lie about it when having another partner is allowed anyway? \u0027Sometimes there might be a fear that a new partner is \u0027better\u0027 in some way than a current one, but good communication and offering reassurances allows that to be dealt with.             Tim and John are straight and have been brought together through Mrs Crumpton\u0027In many ways I have found that being in open relationships has forced me to communicate much better.\u0027I am very honest and open with my partners about my feelings and needs, in a way that I didn\u0027t have the courage to be in previous monogamous relationships. So I think I have grown as a person, and have better and stronger relationships now.\u0027Of course, all of that is possible in monogamous relationships, and I am not suggesting polyamory is in any way better, just different. But it works well for me personally.\u0027I don\u0027t have children, and have no desire to have children. I see no problem with bringing children into a polyamorous set-up though, because I have seen co-parenting work really well for other polyamorous groups. It is not something we plan though.\u0027Mostly people have been great. They had lots of questions about it, and some family members needed reassurance that we were all happy and no-one was getting hurt. I find that I have a huge capacity for romantic love.\u0027I just naturally fall in love with more than one person at a time. So to settle down with just one person for the rest of my life just doesn\u0027t feel natural to me.\u0027People sometimes ask me if it means that I love my husband, or any of my partners less. And I say no. Perhaps it is a bit like how we love our children - when a parent has a second or third child, it doesn\u0027t mean that they love their first child any the less.\u0027I think that romantic love is unlimited too. Time is limited of course. But I do not believe that love is. It certainly isn\u0027t for me.\u0027I get different reactions. Most people are interested and people often say \u0027I wish my wifehusband would let me do that\u0027. I sometimes get negative reactions too - I have been called a slapper or a slag.\u0027I think that negativity mostly arises because I am doing something a bit different and sometimes that can make people feel uncomfortable.             Mrs Crumpton said she has no problem with bringing children into a polyamorous set-up\u0027I have had women assume that I am a \u0027man-eater\u0027 and will try to seduce their husband - to be honest that just makes me laugh.\u0027I have also been told that what I do is \u0027against God\u0027s law\u0027, though in fact there are many instances of multiple marriages in religious texts, and there are denominations of both Christianity and Islam that allow multiple marriages.\u0027Mostly though, people are open to my lifestyle - they can see that I am honest with my partners and that we are all happy, so they see it as no-ones business but ours.\u0027Polyamory is more widely known about now too so it is perhaps less of a shock to people now than it might have been, say, 10 years ago.\u0027We all go out together. For example all going out for drinks for my birthday or to social gatherings and events organised by friends or trips to the cinema or whatever. Tim, John and I go down to London to see my family the three of us. And my sister\u0027s children refer to us as \u0027Auntie Mary, Uncle Tim and Uncle John\u0027.\u0027People have the idea that polyamory is all about sex which isn\u0027t the case. I don\u0027t do one night-stands. I generally wait a month or so at least before becoming sexual with anyone I start dating. I suppose in that sense I am old-fashioned.\u0027My relationships themselves vary in how sexual they are - one of them being more platonic with not much more than cuddling and kissing.\u0027I suppose that, for me, is another good thing about polyamory - each relationship can find its own level in terms of sex and with other things too. And there is no pressure on one relationship to tick all the boxes, so to speak.\u0027Some of the biggest benefits of this way of living are those I have already mentioned, but I guess there is a financial benefit I haven\u0027t mentioned - cohabiting with two of my partners makes things easier financially for us.\u0027So much so, that the three of us took the decision that I would reduce my paid-work-hours and do more unpaid voluntary work in our community.          Manchester Green Party has spoken of its pride at Mrs Crumpton for discussing polyamory\u0027The only negative for me really is dealing with other people being judgemental sometimes. But thankfully I am quite thick-skinned. And I hope that my being open about it with friends, and your readers, will help people understand polyamory better.\u0027Maybe this will mean that there will be less judgement from strangers in the future, just as homosexuality and transexuality have become more accepted in society as people have been more aware of them.\u0027   A Manchester Green Party spokesman said: \u0027We are humbled and proud of our council candidate for Chorlton, Mary Crumpton, for openly discussing a topic that many people would fear due to potential controversy. \u0027Mary has spoken with warmth and responded to hateful comments with dignity traits which would make for an excellent councillor.\u0027The Green Party passed a motion at our Autumn 2017 conference, officially recognising the validity of polyamorous relationships. \u0027We will continue to encourage and champion ersity amongst our members, activists and candidates, and we encourage anyone who is inspired by this story to join us and become part of a welcoming and truly progressive party.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/00/4B1809B800000578-0-image-m-15_1523577129119.jpg","title":"Is Macron backing Syria air strikes","story":"    President Macron has told Vladimir Putin he wants to \u0027intensify\u0027 Syria peace talksEmmanuel Macron has told Vladimir Putin he wants to \u0027intensify\u0027 talks on bringing peace to Syria.The French President gave his Russian counterpart the message during a telephone call on Friday amid diplomatic uproar following the chemical attack in the country.It comes as momentum for revenge air strikes on Syria, which Macron has backed, appears to be slowing. President Trump is yet to make a final decision on what action to take. Forty-three people were killed and inhabitants were left gasping for air after a toxic gas was released into the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Douma on March 7.Macron has said he will respond to \u0027proof\u0027 that Assad\u0027s regime had used chemical weapons \u0027at a time of our choosing.\u0027He made the use of chemical weapons a \u0027red line\u0027 not to be crossed.Now the French leader has reached out to Moscow, which has denied Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime carried out the horrifying attack.May and Trump vow to ‘deter’ Assad from using chemical...Share this article\u0027The president of the Republic said he wanted the dialogue between France and Russia to continue and intensify in order to bring peace and stability to Syria,\u0027 Macron\u0027s office said after the call. Russia claimed its military experts found no evidence of poisonous substances at the site  and accused it of being staged by the White Helmets civil defence organisation.   Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (left) warned on Thursday that threats of Western military action in response to an alleged chemical attack would only lead to further chaos in the region. Vladimir Putin (right) claimed Assad was not responsible for the attackMacron bemoaned Russia\u0027s use this week of its veto to block a UN Security Council resolution on setting up an investigation into the attack to name those responsible.The veto had prevented a \u0027united\u0027 front on putting in place a mechanism \u0027to prevent the regime being a repeat offender,\u0027 Macron said.He told Putin his priority in Syria was the \u0027fight against terrorism\u0027, easing the suffering of civilians and \u0027kickstarting negotiations on a credible and inclusive political process as soon as possible\u0027. Macron said on Thursday he had \u0027proof\u0027 that Assad\u0027s regime had used chemical weapons and that the US and France would response \u0027in due course\u0027.But he also appeared anxious to avoid a wider conflict, saying France would \u0027in no way allow an escalation\u0027.

San Francisco does have a 420 code, but it refers to ‘juvenile disturbance’, a tenuous connection at best. The California penal code does have a 420 section, but it refers to the unlawful prevention or obstruction of a person from entering public land.As for the births and deaths of musical luminaries: Bob Marley died on May 11 Joplin died in October Morrison in July Hendrix in September. Even the chemical composition for cannabis is out, coming in at 483 known compounds.          There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.ACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to knowThe Sandlot cast reunite 25 years on ahead of 25th anniversaryCoachella 2018: Yodelling Walmart kid Mason Ramsey could perform with Post MaloneEndometriosis: What is it, what are the symptoms and how can it be treated?Friday the 13th: Weirdest superstitions revealedWho is Brad Falchuk?

Here are some of the biggest books coming later this year, and in 2019 and 2020.The Fall of Gondolin by JRR Tolkien (August 2018)A “new” novel from the Lord of the Rings author, which has been edited by his son Christopher. The Fall of Gondolin tells the story of Tuor, one of the Noldor elves, who returns to his people’s homeland to attempt to save it from the evil Morgoth.Normal People by Sally Rooney (September 2018)After the great success of her debut Conversations with Friends, the Irish author’s second novel is set in Trinity College Dublin.Simple by Ottolenghi (September 2018)This new cookbook promises the chef’s “trademark vibrant flavours and inventive veg-centred dishes, but brilliantly pared back”.Old Toffer’s Book of Consequential Dogs by Christopher Reid (September 2018)An official sequel of sorts to Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, which came about after Reid was approached by the TS Eliot estate to expand on an idea the poet had after a conversation with his chauffeur.What Love Teaches Me by Ziauddin Yousafzai (November 2018)A “deeply personal” book by Malala Yousafzai’s father, this memoir documents his childhood in deeply patriarchal Pakistan, and how he came to fight for girls’ education alongside his famous daughter.The Accidental Further Adventures of the Hundred-Year-Old Man by Jonas Jonasson (2018)The sequel to the Swedish author’s hugely successful comic novel The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared finds the centenarian embroiled in a diplomatic crisis involving Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump.Four-book deal for Naomi Alderman (2019 onwards)The author of the bestselling feminist novel The Power is set to release a collection of short stories, a non-fiction book and two novels, the first of which is due in 2019.Frankissstein by Jeanette Winterson (2019)A modern reimagining of Mary Shelley’s gothic novel, set to grapple with sexuality and technology.Lanny by Max Porter (March 2019)After the huge success of Grief Is a Thing With Feathers, Porter’s second novel was snapped up in a pre-emptive deal and described as: “playful, irreverent, full of magic. It brings us the best and the worst in English civic life.”Two new Artemis Fowl spin offs from Eoin Colfer (2020 onwards)With a Disney adaptation of his tale of a child genius taking on a militaristic fairy force due on screens in 2019, Colfer is writing two new novels about Artemis’s younger brothers, Myles and Beckett.

He will be paid £775,000 a year plus a bonus of up to £1.7m and will receive £1.05m to make up for not getting his 2018 bonus from the US investment bank.The 49-year-old American’s first task will be to steady LSE after an unusually turbulent period for one of the City’s oldest and most prestigious institutions. After Rolet’s departure was announced in October, TCI Fund Management, one of LSE’s biggest shareholders, called for his reinstatement and accused the board of forcing him out against the interests of investors. The dispute came to a head in late November when Rolet agreed to leave immediately and LSE said its chairman, Donald Brydon, would not stand for re-election after 2019.Schwimmer’s appointment resolves LSE’s quest for a new chief executive less than two weeks before its annual general meeting on 24 April. With a new chief executive lined up, Brydon is likely to face an easier ride at the meeting. TCI declined to comment on the decision to hire Schwimmer.The Yale and Harvard graduate will also have to defend LSE’s position as the world’s biggest clearing house for derivative transactions against competition from European exchanges. Germany’s Deutsche Börse is trying to lure the lucrative business away from London after the Brexit vote. London Clearing House, which LSE controls, processes about three-quarters of the €1tn-a-day (£865bn) clearing market for derivatives, acting as a middleman between buyers and sellers of complex contracts. Rolet warned in 2016 that thousands of City jobs were at risk if London lost responsibility for clearing contracts in euros after Brexit though he said there were very few exchanges that could handle the business.Schwimmer, who is based in New York, spent his first seven years at Goldman advising exchanges and stockbrokers. He then worked as chief of staff to Goldman’s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, when Blankfein was the bank’s chief operating officer. From 2006 to 2009 he jointly ran Goldman’s business in Russia before becoming head of metals and mining. Last year he combined that job with heading Goldman’s market structure business in a return to advising exchanges.Brydon said: “David is a leader with great experience in the financial market infrastructure sector, which he has been closely involved in throughout his investment banking career, as well as capital markets experience in both developed and emerging markets. He is well known for his robust intellect and partnership approach with clients and colleagues alike.”Schwimmer will be the second former Goldman banker to lead the LSE. Rolet spent 10 years at the bank before leaving in 1994. Mark Carney, the Bank of England’s governor, also worked at Goldman. Carney was drawn into LSE’s dispute with TCI when he said he was “mystified” by events at the exchange.Schwimmer will take over from David Warren, who has run LSE as interim chief executive since Rolet’s departure. Warren will return to his job as LSE’s chief financial officer.Michael Werner, an analyst at UBS, the Swiss bank, said Schwimmer’s appointment was good news for LSE because it clears up the leadership question and investors were hoping an outsider would take over. As a former merger and acquisitions banker, Schwimmer will be equipped to buy other companies, in line with its current strategy, he said.

It makes sense: more than four in five Australians live within easy walking or driving distance of the sea. As writer Anna Funder recently said of those who call the driest continent on Earth home: “We cling to the edge of the continent, and we swim from a very early age.”Growing up, I hated swimming – which was awful, because I didn’t just grow up in Australia, I grew up in Queensland: the sun-saturated state that gifted us Olympic gods like Kieran Perkins, Susie O’Neill, Grant Hackett and Stephanie Rice, a state where the main trade seemed to be sugar, coal and championship swimmers.You weren’t just expected to know how to swim you were expected to be good at it, too.My parents were Cantonese migrants from Hong Kong who, in the 1970s, moved to Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, home to some of the country’s most beautiful beaches. It still strikes me as a slightly baffling decision, given neither of them could swim. Water compelled and terrified them and their five Australian-born kids.While other people saw stunning coastlines, we just saw a picturesque way to die. Rips could kill you, people said. Sharks could kill you. Skin cancer could kill you. Weirdly, it was always white people who told us these things, the same white people who seemed to keep going to the beach. Were we missing something? Did they want to die?A safer option was the public pool. Years of TV safety campaigns had convinced Mum we needed to know how to swim, because she sure as hell couldn’t save us if we were drowning. Throughout summer, we’d wail as Mum drove us to the nearest suburban leisure centre for lessons. I suspect we dreaded those lessons as much as our instructors dreaded teaching us, those hopeless Asian kids spluttering with anxiety inside the enclosed training pool, those stinking hothouses of chemicals, piss and wet togs (or cossies, or bathers, or swimmers – depending on your state).After the nightmare was over, we’d be sedated with a treat – a Redskin (Australians veer towards racism even with our confectionary), an ice block or a packet of frogs – before falling asleep in the stuffy Ford Cortina, hair matted to our temples, seat belts twisted into our skin and fingers dusted orange from the Twisties we stole from each other.The horror didn’t end there. At school, not only were swimming lessons mandatory, carnivals were too – annual, school-run swim meets, ostensibly fun but deeply competitive. We even had togs in school colours that we had to buy from the uniform shop.During the lessons, I’d watch fit white kids e in and carve through water with graceful limbs that seemed custom-built for the job. Meanwhile, in Lane 1 or 6 – where I could still hold onto the wall – I’d windmill uselessly, my hands banging into the water like saucepans. There was a direct, inverse correlation between the amount of splashing I made and the distance I travelled. At swimming carnivals, all the outcasts were bunched together: the ethnic kid with no body fat (me) pale kids with lots of body fat. We had to swim in an event – any event – so we’d do the novelty race, paddling together on inflatable rafts, damp with chlorine and shame, as everyone cheered and jeered us on. But then, weirdly, I fell in love with swimming. I left home for university, moved to Brisbane and into a rambling architectural mess of a shared house. Its design was … incorrect. It attracted the heat in summer, then trapped it. During heatwaves, my flatmates and I would emerge from our rooms having barely slept and looking boiled. I took refuge from the heat at the Olympic-sized council pool at the bottom of our hill. It didn’t look like much from the outside, but inside it was pure and clean, with a panoramic view of the city skyline. I didn’t have proper togs so I swam in black boxer briefs, hoping no one would notice. After a while, I tried swimming laps.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.Alan, the pool manager, took pity on me. “Instead of bashing into the water with your arms like that,” he said, “stretch out like this and twist your entire torso. Instead of exhaling like that, hum and you won’t lose your breath so quickly.” It was homework, and I’d always liked homework. Slowly, I got faster.By the time I moved to Sydney, I owned proper Speedos, goggles and a kickboard. I signed myself up for a 1km charity ocean swim. From some angles it seemed as though I had pecs. Who was this person?I’ve been helped by the fact Sydney has – hands down – the best lap pools in the world. Every inner-city public pool is a wonder in some way. My local, the Prince Alfred Park Pool, is an award-winning architectural miracle built into a hill – like a swimming oasis for hobbits. It’s impossible to take a bad photo of North Sydney Olympic Pool, where the reward for finishing laps is endless Instagram-ready photos of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which towers above the pool like a CGI hallucination. On the other side of the harbour, Andrew “Boy” Charlton Pool is plonked right in the middle of the botanical gardens, decked out like a resort and boasting so many toned men in Speedos, it feels like you’re in the video for Kylie Minogue’s Slow.Even Sydney’s indoor pools – which I usually avoid because of the claustrophobic chlorine pong – are impressive. Ultimo’s dreamy, wave-walled Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre (the first Sydney pool I ever swam in) is a Harry Seidler original, a modernist wave of concrete and steel rising from Darling Harbour. In the Cook + Phillip Park Aquatic and Fitness Centre are giant paintings by the Archibald winner Wendy Sharpe, making it one of the few places where you can do laps in an art gallery.For a spiritual experience, it’s all about the ocean baths. On good days, you can swim alongside schools of fish in Wylie’s Baths in Coogee. There’s a reason people rave about Bondi Icebergs, with its sauna overlooking the violent churn of the surf below. And though I’ll never get to visit, I love the idea of Coogee’s McIver’s Ladies Baths, the last remaining women’s-only seawater pool in Australia. Apparently it’s particularly popular with nuns, Muslim women and lesbians I like thinking about the unexpected friendships that have been made there.Is it too far to say swimming is the Australian version of baptism? To me, these places feel sacred to swim in them veers towards sacrament. When I get writer’s block, I swim. When I need space, I swim. When I need company, I swim. When I’m depressed, I swim. When I’m happy, I swim.Last Christmas, my siblings and I – all comically terrible swimmers as kids – laughed at the fact that our eldest sister was now a regular surfer. The remaining four of us now swim regularly in lap pools. Those Asian kids at school, so bad at swimming carnivals that they were constantly disqualified? Well, some of them grew up and now swim  kilometres for leisure. It shouldn’t be surprising – we’re also Australian, after all.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

The\u0026nbspburglar’s friends and relatives have made a little shrine from flowers and balloons above the pavement where he collapsed and died. Residents have repeatedly removed and trampled it. The police have appealed for calm and respect on both sides, and been roundly abused for it. That’s because this is a essentially religious skirmish, one in which symbolism brings up profound questions about the worth of an apparently worthless life. Flower power was not meant to work like this.Henry Vincent was a career criminal who preyed on old people, sometimes using force. On 4 April he was stabbed in the kitchen of 78-year-old Richard Osborn-Brooks, who found him there going equipped with a screwdriver. An accomplice fled and is still wanted by the police. Osborn-Brooks will not be charged and public sentiment, as well as the law, is overwhelmingly on his side. Since Vincent’s death many accounts have surfaced of his earlier crimes. Yet he left a family and friends. There are those who mourn him, and they come from a Traveller community where ostentatious public displays of grief and respect are essential funeral rites.Nothing more clearly demonstrates your position\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspsociety than your treatment after death. Today this is a matter of respect, like granting Stephen\u0026nbspHawking a grave in Westminster Abbey. But historically it has often been the opposite. Denying recognition to a corpse was a way of demonstrating exclusion. People who took their own lives were denied Christian burial the corpse of Oliver Cromwell was dug up when the monarchy was restored so that it could be mutilated and publicly displayed in the Iliad, Achilles drags the naked corpse of Hector behind his chariot around the walls of Troy until old king Priam comes to beg for the corpse of his son to give it a decent burial.It would be an exaggeration to say that the supporters of Osborn-Brooks want these things done to the corpse of Henry Vincent, but they want him away, they want him forgotten, and they want his memory out of their neighbourhood. Funerals and graves are ways of manipulating the sacred, but they also make territorial claims. “There is some corner of a foreign field,” wrote Rupert Brooke, foreseeing his own unglamorous death from dysentery, “that is forever England.”To place a memorial to Vincent on the spot where he died suggests that he had a right to be there, as well as a\u0026nbspright to live, and this is something that seems\u0026nbspviscerally\u0026nbspwrong to anyone who felt threatened by\u0026nbspthe activities of his gang.For both sides, then, this unassuming wooden fence has become a shrine. It is a symbol whose meaning can neither be avoided nor agreed. To one side it is a tribute to the other, a deliberate provocation. This row is playing on the roots of religion.The anthropologist Scott Atran talks about sacred values as being those symbols which seem so important that people are prepared to die or kill for them. This is related to the claim of one of the founders of modern sociology, Émile Durkheim, that soldiers in wartime fight, quite literally, for their flag. The thing about sacred objects, Atran says, is that they cannot be exchanged for worldly advantages. Conflicts over shrines, or sacred objects, can only be settled when both sides acknowledge the symbolic claims of the other.In that light, it is obvious how this conflict might have been resolved: by the relatives of Henry Vincent acknowledging the pain and distress he had caused, and apologising for it before they mourned his good qualities. What actually happened was almost the opposite. Possibly angered by widely reported comments from earlier victims that the dead man had\u0026nbspbeen no loss to the world, supporters of Vincent mocked Osborn-Brooks and rejoiced on social media at\u0026nbspthe way that he has been driven from his home by the\u0026nbsppressure and media attention. It’s tempting to ask who needs religion when you’ve got social media to do\u0026nbspthe work of stirring hatred.But in fact this is a moment when only some kind of\u0026nbspsymbolic, religious ceremony could possibly settle the dispute. Legally, a public street is public. The family and friends of Henry Vincent have a perfect right to be there, just as he did. But emotionally it’s a neighbourhood. The police cannot resolve the dispute by keeping one side or the other away. They cannot enforce one vision over another, nor should they. But neither is there any longer any recognised religious authority which could reconcile these two visions.Perhaps the funeral of Henry Vincent will\u0026nbspoffer a remembrance of his life reflecting his family’s conviction that he did not deserve to die. Perhaps that is\u0026nbspthe underlying message of every funeral:\u0026nbspthat the dead do not deserve to die, however bad their lives. But\u0026nbspno one should be forced to remember them who doesn’t want to.• Andrew Brown writes on religion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51bb3c7bbeeb9686e8c187845226de381ae5058c/447_442_6024_3614/master/6024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=74d40fd8cea88f19e524a6c7687ec155 1240w","title":"british museum director hartwig fischer there are no foreigners here the museum is a world country","story":"The German art historian reveals plans for an extensive revamp at Britain’s most visited attraction, but won’t be drawn on calls to return plundered worksHartwig Fischer, who took over the directorship of the British Museum from Neil MacGregor two years ago, has no decoration on the plain blue walls of his office. There are glass-fronted bookshelves. There ia a desk and chairs and two enormous sash windows looking out on to the great forecourt. (Or, more immediately, on to what some staff call the “Bake Off tent” – the ugly temporary structure through which visitors must currently pass for security checks.) But there is nothing to signal Fischer’s taste – nothing like the glimmering wall sculpture by El Anatsui that MacGregor had nothing like the array of Staffordshire pottery that Tristram Hunt displays in his office at the V\u0026ampA no equivalent to the Paula Rego that Maria Balshaw favours in her lair at Tate. There is only a reproduction of a Cycladic figure on the fireplace, a leftover from the MacGregor years, and, on his desk lamp, a tiny figurine of Sai Baba, a spiritual master revered as a saint, which Indian friends gave him.Instead, he says, he prefers to concentrate on the people who come through his doors – and the great treasure house of the museum. But the blankness of his working space radiates through his personal manner: he is warm and friendly, but oddly remote. His employees contrast the charismatic immediacy of MacGregor, who had the disconcerting habit of plonking himself down by random staffers in the canteen and interrogating them about their work, with this more distant figure, who speaks softly and carefully, who glides modestly around the galleries, who is sphinx-like in his statements. But for all that, he is quietly formidable, and has vast ambitions for the museum – plans that will, if they see the light of day, transform the museum for generations to come.Fischer, 56, who came to London after running the state museums in Dresden, is aiming to put the museum, in all its shopworn grandeur, through a major renovation project that will culminate in a complete redisplay of its galleries. That doesn’t sound so remarkable until you begin to absorb the scale of the job. When I joke that it can’t be as big as the Palace of Westminster’s renovation, which will cost at least £3.5bn, he tells me that the museum has more rooms than parliament – 3,000 versus 1,100 – and that the state of the essential services, such as electricity, gas and water are in dire need of repair, just as they are at Westminster. He has in mind something as grand and decisive as the “projet grand” Louvre, which saw the building of IM Pei’s dramatic pyramids and cost between F6bn and F7bn (around £780m at 1993 prices). Or the recent renovation of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which saw the institution closed for a decade and a bill of €375m.Unlike Amsterdam, though, Fischer says: “We cannot close the museum. It’s entirely out of the question.” The British Museum is the most visited attraction in Britain, with 5.9m visitors last year. Work will have to be phased. It will take years. As for even a vague price tag, he is not to be drawn: assessments are still being carried out. And who will pay? Clearly, there will have to be the mother of all fundraising campaigns. But Fischer carefully notes that the Louvre and the Rijksmuseum were renewed “with the support of their governments”. What Fischer hopes to achieve by the end of all this is a display that is more coherent – and more interconnected. That means reshuffling the Egyptian, Greek and Roman collections so that they are not scattered between two floors as they are at present, and also finding ways to show that, as Fischer puts it, “human history was driven and has always been driven by exchange, by cultures communicating”. The interconnectedness he is keen to demonstrate might also be across time: towards the end of our interview we go over to the museum’s big exhibition space, where a stunning show on Rodin and ancient Greek sculpture is being installed. It’s the first exhibition to have been largely developed under his leadership, and its approach – looking at how an artist was shaped by his understanding of the past – might prove a hint at the shape of the programme to come.It’s an intriguing time to be considering the renewal of the British Museum – one of the world’s few so-called “encyclopedic museums” – as Fischer puts it, “a museum of the world for the world”. But Britain is on the brink of Brexit, turning its face away from Europe. When I ask Fischer if he would have taken the job had it been offered on 24 June 2016, he says: “Yes, without any hesitation whatsoever.” This contrasts to the view taken by the late Martin Roth, his predecessor at Dresden, whose resignation from the V\u0026ampA in September 2016 was said to have been hastened by disillusion at the referendum.The museum’s job, Fischer says, is to take the long view, to confront the whole of human history, to understand that Brexit is a moment in the turbulent story of the world. But at the same time: “Everyone who knows me knows I come from a European background and that Europe, as it developed after the catastrophe of the wars is something very important and precious to me. The museum has a lot to offer to help people to contemplate and reflect on what the right decisions should be without taking a direct political stance. It’s there as a space to think, reflect, debate.” It is true that Fischer could hardly be more European. He was raised in Hamburg, studied in Italy and France, and has worked in Switzerland as well as Germany his wife is a psychotherapist in Paris. It’s easy to imagine what his personal views might be, even if for now, they are cloaked in civil service neutrality. He simply says: “Whoever comes in here and crosses the threshold is not a foreigner. There are no foreigners here. This is a world country, this museum. While at the same time we recognise that this is a British creation, to which the cultures of all the world have contributed.”Contributed, yes – but not always willingly. The museum’s collection is inextricably entwined with Britain’s dark imperial past. Increasingly, nations want their objects back: not just the Greeks and the Parthenon sculptures, but others – there is a longstanding claim from Ethiopia, for example, about works of art plundered from Maqdala after its capture by the British in 1868.It’s all very well, I suggest, talking of the museum as an international project, and even as a space where international co-operation between colleagues can continue when formal diplomatic ties are strained. (Fischer made a visit to Iran in December when we meet, he has just returned from Egypt.) But the buck stops for many with the objects themselves, with the fact of possession and ownership. “When you go to see the Parthenon sculptures,” he says, “you can read about the different views, the conflicting views, and we respect different views.” Respecting views is one thing, but keeping the objects is another – that’s the line drawn right there, isn’t it? “It is a line. But what’s been created here is a major contribution to humanity. So while I respect these views, I always say what has been created here, which is open to everybody, creates an extraordinary opportunity to see cultural heritage in a context you have in only a very few places. That is the museum’s major value and it is very precious.”Fischer has come into this environment from the relatively easier circumstances of Germany, where government support for culture, though under recent pressure, is understood as a given, not fought over tooth and nail every step of the way. One of the things he is really passionate about is a music festival he has organised it will see everything from Ligeti and Nono to Japanese temple music performed in the museum’s galleries. “I’ve always worked with musicians in museums,” he says. “When you look at things listening, you look at things differently. The ears make you see more, and the eyes make you hear more.” Ironically, the festival, which is organised in partnership with the Dresden museums, is being paid for by the German foreign ministry. Still, what impresses him in London, he says, is his staff’s passionate sense of public mission. “You would never think about doing something in this place before asking who it is for. You would never get lost in an intricate scholarly debate without coming back to that question: ‘How is our public going to profit from this?’ And I cherish every day working in this environment.”The music festival Europe and the World: a Symphony of Cultures, runs from 16 to 29 April. Rodin and the art of Ancient Greece runs from 26 April to 29 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21652220c12e4a62c5360786df0c1f2077c63afc/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a09b7e20b1f8199ca8594d62834d6468 1240w","title":"uk university strike action to end after staff vote to accept offer","story":"Ballot finds significant majority in favour of accepting offer to reopen talks over pensionsThe strike action that hit 65 universities across the UK this year is to end after staff voted to accept an offer to reopen negotiations with employers over their pensions.The ballot of 50,000 University and College Union members in higher education found a substantial majority in favour of accepting the offer, which establishes a joint committee of experts to evaluate pensions provided through the University Superannuation Scheme (USS).There was a high turnout of nearly two-thirds of eligible members, with more than 21,000 voting to accept the offer from Universities UK, and 12,000 voting to reject it. A further wave of strikes due to begin next week has been suspended.Fourteen days of teaching were lost to strikes on 65 campuses last term, with fears that further action in summer would disrupt final examinations and mean that students on some courses might be unable to graduate.The strike centred on a radical overhaul of the USS – the country’s largest private sector pension scheme with 400,000 members at 67 universities and colleges, as well as 300 specialist institutions such as the Royal Society and Cancer Research UK. Staff anger was triggered by a decision in January in favour of the employers that would have ended the scheme’s defined benefits – guaranteed levels of payment to members upon retirement.Instead, the fixed benefits would be replaced by defined contributions, in which members would pay in but their eventual pension payments would be dictated by their level of payment and the state of financial markets at retirement.Sally Hunt, the UCU general secretary, said: “The union has come a very long way since January when it seemed that the employers’ proposals for a defined contribution pension were to be imposed.“Now we have agreement to move forward jointly, looking again at the USS valuation alongside a commitment from the employers to a guaranteed, defined benefit scheme.“We hope this important agreement will hearten workers across the UK fighting to defend their pension rights and was won through the amazing strike action of UCU members.”Universities UK said the decision to appoint an expert panel and suspend industrial action would reassure students that their exams would not be affected. “It is important that interested parties engage with the panel and remain open-minded about its possible findings,” a UUK spokesperson said.“Working in partnership with UCU, we will now appoint a jointly agreed chair for the panel as soon as possible before developing its terms of reference, order of work and timescales.”The Office for Students – the universities regulator in England – has told universities to make clear to students what the impact of the industrial action will be and how any related disruption will be handled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e468c9317e206a48590926eeb0b77f13ed56cffb/0_0_5400_3594/master/5400.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3fd0e07236ad5b2b055de6b57abc1ac9 1760w","title":"eusebio di francesco roma liverpool champions league semi final","story":"It is 34 years since Roma reached a European Cup semi-final. And only one month less than that since Liverpool beat them on penalties in the final. Older fans still wince at the memory, hardly surprising when you consider it took place at their very own Stadio Olimpico.Times change, though, and this two-leg tie has a very different context. Roma, bluntly, did not expect to come this far. When they were drawn against Shakhtar Donetsk in the last 16, their captain, Daniele De Rossi, said there were “two or three teams in this season’s Champions League against whom, in all probability, we would already be beaten before kick-off”.Such self-doubt might finally have been blown away by a sensational quarter-final win over Barcelona. Yet Roma hardly put a foot wrong in this year’s competition until their first-leg defeat at the Camp Nou. They finished top of a group featuring Atlético Madrid and Chelsea, and still have not conceded a goal at home.Their manager, Eusebio Di Francesco, has shown a knack for drawing the best out of his teams on the big occasions. His switch to an untested 3-4-1-2 formation in the second leg against Barcelona caught the leaders of La Liga off guard and allowed Roma to swamp the midfield, privileging the natural physicality of De Rossi, Radja Nainggolan and Kevin Strootman.Liverpool should not necessarily expect to see the same thing. Roma have played most of this season in a 4-3-3, the same formation that Di Francesco used for most of his career. “It only has one problem,” he once said. “You struggle to mark your opponent’s playmaker.”Hence the change against Barcelona, for whom Lionel Messi thrived in the first leg but not the second. Will Di Francesco develop a similarly tailored plan to counter Mohamed Salah? Many of his Roma players may have their own opinions on how to deal with their former team-mate. The manager is less familiar, having taken over only in the summer.Di Francesco’s first term has been mixed: success in Europe distracting from an up-and-down season domestically. Although Roma are joint third, they trail the league leaders Juventus by 21 points. The lack of a viable alternative to Edin Dzeko at centre-forward has been glaring at times, with Patrik Schick, acquired to great fanfare from Sampdoria in the summer, scoring only in the Coppa Italia.That said, Roma have goals elsewhere: Diego Perotti and Stephan El Shaarawy are capable of cutting in to score from the flanks, as is the 20-year-old Cengiz Ünder, who has been in scintillating form since February. The Giallorossi are solid at the back, too, where Aleksandar Kolarov has proved a brilliant signing.They can also rely on an excellent goalkeeper in Alisson. Brazil’s No 1 was back-up to Wojciech Szczesny last season but has emerged as one of Serie A’s best, a true sweeper-keeper mopping up problems behind his defence and launching attacks with his feet, not to mention leaving more than one attacker sprawling in the dirt with a feint or dummy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e0504ff0d1aed4350ac68d43917ac0f3cb213e/399_143_744_744/master/744.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=464ec7869477c0b45511177fefb51395 1240w","title":"thomasina miers recipe for pickled herring beetroot and horseradish salad","story":" The sharpness of cured fish is a delight against tender and earthy beets, making a wonderful light lunchAt weekends I like to go to my local farmers’ market and head straight to the fish stand.

After a patient build-up, 2017 was such a breakthrough year for the bewitching London-born singer – selling over a million copies of her self-titled debut album and cruising past some of the world’s biggest pop stars to be crowned the most-streamed female artist in the UK – that she could probably take a few months off. But Lipa has continued her vertiginous career ascent in 2018, claiming two Brit awards in February, teaming up with dancefloor genie Calvin Harris for sleek new club banger One Kiss and insouciantly cracking a billion YouTube views for New Rules, her signature hit that warns against backsliding into a lousy relationship with a stern but moreish checklist-style mantra.While impressive on paper, racking up record-breaking streaming stats can sometimes feel like an intangible, almost passive form of success. But Lipa’s industrious workrate and gruelling tour schedule (including a stint supporting Coldplay) have clearly brought palpable real-world benefits. When she last played Glasgow six months ago it was in a crammed 2,500-capacity venue. Now she is packing them to the rafters in a giant arena bowl made for 13,000. Her core fanbase skews young and female but while the screams are as loud and piercing as at any Bieber show, the crowd seem keen to reflect back some of Lipa’s worldly sophistication. Compared to most full-bore pop gigs at the Hydro, there is a distinct lack of strobing deely boppers.On magazine covers and in impeccably styled promo shots, Lipa often looks aloof or simply nonplussed. But the 22-year-old kicks off by imploring fans to “be your most unapologetic you” and “dance the night away”, and promptly leads by example through Blow Your Mind (Mwah), a slice of futuristic disco that slyly incorporates an actual kiss-off into its chorus. For sustained stretches of her 90-minute show, Lipa is in perpetual motion, bouncing and reeling round the stage in billowing black joggers, springy trainers and aquamarine bra. She is flanked by four equally tireless dancers while her long-serving backing trio of a drummer and two multitasking keyboardguitarists jam away atop oversized stage cubes.A massive projection screen showing artfully stylised visuals and pulsing hyperspace starfields is arena-show standard but otherwise there is a distinct lack of large-scale staging gimmicks. It makes it all the more impressive that Lipa is able to sustain so many winningly jazzercise-style dance routines without missing a note.There are moments of delirious communion, as when Lipa hoists herself up on the front-row stage barrier to conduct a singalong to the yearning Be the One. But there are also moments of spine-tingling spotlight: the stripped-down obsessional ballad Thinking ’Bout You, with just her and guitar, showcases her voice at its smokiest. Strip away the headstrong beats and synthy stabs of her biggest hits and Lipa would remain a potent, intuitive torch singer.The biggest laugh of the night comes toward the end when a title card pops up dedicating IDGAF to “all the fuckboys who have done you wrong”. While this playground-chant anthem to empowerment doesn’t yet match the climactic New Rules in terms of streams and views, it is – perhaps tellingly – the song fans are raucously singing a capella as they spill out of the venue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e91b772027eb70014982f82a71a3a27066f94e/0_0_1233_1230/master/1233.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=be1815b3f4b5852e380c66156abf0e75 1240w","title":"chess leonard barden fabiano caruana magnus carlsen grenke","story":"Fabiano Caruana has won two elite tournaments in a fortnight, jumped to No\u0026nbsp2 in the live ratings only 21 points behind the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, and starts play in the US championship in St Louis on\u0026nbspWednesday.America’s world title challenger is already putting psychological pressure on Carlsen, seven months before their 12-game world title series.

Later still Carlsen will be at Biel, Switzerland, in July, while in September Caruana will lead the US team in the 150-nation Olympiad as they bid to repeat their gold medals of 2016.For both, this is an intense competitive programme compared with past world championships where the players would often prepare with their aides for weeks or months. It foreshadows a tight and close contest in November which is likely to go the distance. Since title matches were reduced to the best of 12 games, nearly half of them have been settled by speed tie-breaks.Right now, Carlsen and Caruana are evenly matched and in their 20s with many career years ahead, so there is the prospect of one of the great chess rivalries developing, like Alexander Alekhine v José Raúl Capablanca in the 1920s and 1930s, Mikhail Botvinnik v Vassily Smyslov in the 1950s, and Anatoly Karpov v Garry Kasparov in the 1980s.Caruana broke another taboo in the final round at Grenke when he unleashed a startling opening novelty rather than hoard it until November. After 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 d4 Nxe4 4 dxe5 d5 5 Nbd2 Qd7!? has the immediate idea that if White continues 6 Nxe4 and swaps queens Black can retake with the knight on d7 rather than with king or bishop on d8. More subtly, the queen move prefaced a light square strategy for Black’s army.White lacked a decent middle game plan, and Vitiugov’s 10 Ng5?! (10 Qd2) and 13 O-O?! (13 c3) allowed Caruana to improve his position. After 16…d4! Black was well on top as his Bd5 and Nf5 were monsters cramping White’s activity. 28 Bxf5 eliminated the dominating knight, but then Caruana had the bishop pair. The pressure mounted even after exchange of queens until 36 Nxf5? (36 Nc2 is more resilient) conceded the exchange,after which Caruana quickly wrapped up the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/577b05f8bfda3af75043299b809cc1908802ba52/315_569_4918_2951/master/4918.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=027238a081f7a5349b3e85a2ca1654c7 1240w","title":"grand national bryony frost katie walsh rachel blackmore horse racing women jockeys","story":"“A girl, ladies and gentlemen! A bit of a girl clutching the neck of a bandy-legged outsider streaked across the line to win the greatest race in turfdom! A girl wins the Grand National!”Thus gabbles the radio commentator in the 1944 film National Velvet, heralding the success of a character played by Elizabeth Taylor. Three parts of a century have since rolled by and horse racing reporters are still waiting for their chance to trumpet such a line for real, hopefully without the patronising diminutive. But perhaps the moment is finally at hand because Saturday’s race will feature an almost unprecedented three female jockeys.They have not been booked for outsiders, bandy-legged or otherwise their horses feature in the top half of the betting. Nor are they unknown teenagers, like Taylor’s character, but established riders of proven talent. On his way to Aintree on Thursday, the Telegraph’s man tweeted a picture of Enid Bagnold’s novel that was the source for National Velvet and asked: “Is this the most relevant form book for this year’s race?”Bagnold’s heroine, the strong-willed Velvet Brown with her uncanny empathy for a horse, is arguably a pallid creation by comparison with the effervescent Bryony Frost, who will take her first tilt at the National aboard Milansbar. Frost, a self-described “Devon dumpling” and the daughter of a National-winning rider, had a donkey for a babysitter from the age of two and used to fall asleep on his back. She was in pony races from the age of nine. If ever a person was born and raised to be a steeplechase jockey, she was.She will be joined in Saturday’s lineup by Rachael Blackmore, only the second female professional jockey in the history of Irish jump racing, and Katie Walsh, whose third place in the 2012 National is the best result achieved by a woman. Those coincidence backers annually drawn to the National may like to know that Walsh’s mount, Baie Des Iles, will carry the same saddle-cloth number (28) as did Taylor’s in the movie.The no-nonsense Walsh will surely take no interest in such a detail. Asked if this is a significant moment, she underlines the importance of opportunity. “The reality of it is that I’m riding for my husband. And Rachael has an association with Gigginstown, owners of her horse. And Bryony is riding a horse she won on last time.“Next year, that might not be the case. I wouldn’t be riding in the National, if I wasn’t riding one for Ross.”Walsh was born into a racing family, which opened doors. She is well aware other talented jockeys, male and female, are less fortunate. “It’s just so competitive. It’s a very small, condensed sport and there’s only room for a handful of people at the top.”Only once before have three women ridden in the National, 30 years ago. Penny Ffitch-Heyes and Venetia Williams were thrilled to be in the lineup but both were on no-hopers, at odds of 100-1 and 200-1 respectively, and neither got beyond the sixth fence. Gee Armytage fared better on Gee-A, leading the field on the run down to the second Becher’s before her horse tired.Female participation in the National had become the norm, soon after Charlotte Brew was the trailblazer in 1977. Over the next 12 years, 11 different women had rides in the race. Since then, only four new names have been added to the list. While Walsh and her sister-in-law Nina Carberry have had 11 rides between them, no other woman has lined up since 2005. Where did all the female jump jockeys go?Some, including Armytage, have suggested trainers and owners were put off using women by a series of shocking injuries, including the death of Jayne Thompson at Catterick and the paralysis suffered by Sharron Murgatroyd and Jessica Charles-Jones in incidents at other tracks. Such things also happened to men, but female pain, according to the theory, was harder for some people to contemplate.That is not how Williams sees it, having had a long and successful career as a trainer. “I don’t think injuries are what put people off, really. Maybe that was the party line but we weren’t very good. End of. These girls are a hell of a lot better than we were in my day.“Gee Armytage might get a bit cross with me for saying that,” she adds, laughing, “but they’re streets better.”Thanks to the cumulative effect of Walsh, Carberry, Frost and Blackmore, it seems racing insiders are increasingly prepared to accept the right woman on the right horse can successfully fight her corner in any jumps race. Paul Nicholls, a former champion trainer, has given Frost a huge push. Gigginstown Stud, the dominant owner in Irish jumps racing, regularly employs female jockeys.Frost and Blackmore will inevitably, some day, get chances to prove how resilient they can be when injured. But when one reporter told Frost this week to “come back in one piece”, she just laughed.“I’m not worried about that,” she said. “Getting in the car is the most dangerous part of the day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2faac8aa58f51741e1a7c9a5e23d1f646b49037f/0_312_4049_2430/master/4049.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=68fb68cae760281ecd42f90abaf3bf73 1240w","title":"rugby union england six nations saracens mako vunipola rest period","story":"Saracens have named Mako Vunipola in their team to face Bath on Sunday despite being obliged to rest him according to an agreement between the Rugby Football Union and the Premiership.He went on holiday to Tenerife after the Six Nations but was a used replacement in Saracens’ win over Harlequins a week after England’s tournament finale against Ireland.

Has not won since and yet somehow remains 6lb higher than for his Fairyhouse success. Was not to blame for his jockey being knocked out of the saddle in this last year but harder to make excuses for his falls in his last two races, since he got about halfway up the fence on each occasion and was under no great pressure at the time. The ability is probably still in there somewhere.Looked the likely winner when going clear after the third-last a year ago but was on fumes by the final fence and faded into fourth. More conservative tactics might help but he’s 9lb higher and carries 12lb more in absolute terms. Romped to glory in the Becher, showing how well he goes round here, but the extra weight he got for that did not help at Haydock in February, where he couldn’t go with the easy winner and finished tired. Travelled well and was still going on at the finish when third in the Gold Cup, suggesting he might cope with this distance. Beat 27 rivals by daylight in a hotly contested handicap chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. Still on a beatable rating but this is asking a lot, with a big weight to carry. Doesn’t always get that high at his fences and took a heavy fall in the Irish Gold Cup. Also took a liberty at Cheltenham’s third-last and there is likely to be at least one scare along the way.Couldn’t finish quite as strongly as a classy rival when second in the 2016 National. Shot up the ratings, has not won since and is still 10lb higher than that day. Faded into a well-beaten 16th last year and something similar seems likely. Admirably consistent but in need of luck.Wasn’t far off the best when with Willie Mullins, for whom he won two Grade Ones as a novice. May well have won the 2016 Irish Gold Cup, but for unseating at the last. Missed a year and four runs since his comeback seem to show him in decline. Still high in the weights, just 5lb below his peak, and would need something like his best to get involved here. Stamina must also be taken on trust, as he’s never raced beyond three miles and a furlong.Instantly improved by last summer’s move to Willie Mullins, since when his only failure has been a fall in the Gold Cup. Won the Munster National easily and then scrambled home in the Ladbrokes Trophy, when held up for a late challenge. Now 9lb higher but likely to have more to offer and wasn’t out of it when hitting the deck at Cheltenham. A clear round will surely put him in contention.Not far short of the best as a staying hurdler and useful over fences but is rated to the hilt of his ability. Ran a fair race to be eighth in last year’s Irish National, when he was hampered by a faller, and beaten only by Total Recall in the Munster National, trying to give him lumps of weight. Not usually a strong finisher and has broken blood vessels at times.Cheltenham specialist who has run many fine races there but not usually to the same level elsewhere. Pulled up at the fourth-last a year ago and only 2lb lower in the weights this time but trainer says he had an interrupted preparation then. A sound jumper and solid stayer with no secrets from the handicapper and likely to be outpaced by something if still in contention after the last.Would have an extra 4lb to carry if the weights had not been set in February, since when he ran a fine second at the Cheltenham Festival, finishing strongly to be beaten by a neck. Promising teenage jockey who rode that day will be aboard again. Pulled up four fences from home last year but was only seven and entitled to do better now. Hasn’t won since but several efforts have suggested he is ready for this marathon trip. Slight concern that his Cheltenham form is so much better than elsewhere.A front-runner when things go well, he never got involved last year and finished 17th. In common with most of his stablemates, has been well below his best this year but the yard is now getting winners. Wins over fences have come in small fields, which does not augur well here. It’s more than five years since he won at a track where the bends go to the left.Irish Gold Cup winner of 2015 and 2016, this veteran has dropped a stone from his peak rating in the past year and is now on a weight that would make him dangerous if he returned to something like his best. Has shown little in four runs this season but all came before New Year, when he has not traditionally been at his best. Interesting.Has been useful and consistent around the northern tracks this winter but it’s hard to believe he has the class for this and his stamina seems to have been exposed by weak finishing efforts in his last two starts.Three times a winner at the Cheltenham Festival, including in the Cross-Country last month. Has also won a Munster National, so neither big fields nor marathon distances are a problem. He’s not wonderfully consistent and was well beaten on the two previous occasions when he ran a month after Festival success. Also, he’s not the biggest and could meet trouble when the field bunches up at the Becher’s – Canal Turn section of the course. But he undoubtedly has the talent to win and it would be no surprise if he did so with authority.Ran on in eye-catching style to be eighth last year, having seemingly been given too much to do. Put up another fine effort when third in the Ladbrokes Trophy in December and warmed up for this by scoring at Ascot in February. Has taken years to build on his early promise but finally doing so and has it in him to land a major prize. Still on a fair weight and 4lb well in, as his Ascot win came after the weights were set.Hoping it can be third time lucky but the limitations of his stamina seemed to be exposed by the last two Nationals. Has had a poor season, failing to finish within 12 lengths of a winner, but is slightly higher in the ratings than for his previous two attempts, which hardly seems fair. Comes from a stable having a poor run.Muddy marathons are the thing for this winner of last year’s Midlands National. On drier ground or against classy opposition, he generally gets left behind. Having won at Haydock in November, he went up 10lb and has struggled in two subsequent runs, suggesting he lacks the necessary quality unless it rains plenty. A dogged galloper, he goes well at Newbury and should therefore be suited by this circuit. Looked as though he was reaching the limits of his stamina when headed close home in the Great Yorkshire Chase, over a mile shorter than this. Up against it, on a rating 12lb higher than when he last won.Third in the Scottish National two years ago, though his jumping was scrappy at times and his stamina gave out about a furlong from the line. Has had a wind operation. Because of injuries, his decent third in a much shorter race last month was his first run over fences for 16 months, which is not ideal preparation. Nicely weighted on the pick of his form, including a defeat of Blaklion at Cheltenham two years ago. Jumped the last with the leaders last year but had nothing left and tired into fifth, having taken a shoulder-barge from the runner-up at the second-last. Fell at the first in 2015 but usually does well over these fences, having won here in December. Has held his form so well that he is now rated higher than ever, 4lb higher than for last year’s race. Another respectable showing is likely.Career best in January when running away with the Peter Marsh, pulling 13 lengths clear of Captain Redbeard. Was fired up the ratings to a mark 9lb higher than he’s ever been and may struggle to compete until he drops back down. He was carrying less weight that day than four other finishers of moderate talent, whereas here he will mix with Festival winners on a similar weight. Stopped quickly and was found to have bled from the nose when pulled up at Haydock in February.Given every chance last year by a masterful Ruby Walsh ride, creeping smoothly into contention on the second circuit before getting tired from the third-last and finishing ninth. Jumped soundly but stumbled and nearly unseated on landing over second Valentine’s, which can’t have helped. Only 1lb lower, despite modest efforts on both starts this season, and won’t have Walsh’s help. This plodder must be one of the few horses to spend three years in Gordon Elliott’s yard without winning. Often runs well, however, and has twice been placed in the Thyestes and also in Leopardstown’s Paddy Power Chase. Was a distant sixth in this race two years ago after notable mistakes. Went well last year until a rival jumped across him at Becher’s, causing his rider to fall off. Generally a sound jumper but will surely find something too quick for him on the run-in, even if his stamina holds up.Fine record at Aintree in April stretches back to 2011, when he won a Grade One novice hurdle. Won a handicap chase the next year and has since been second and third in the National, from four attempts. Soft ground is no use, as he showed when pulled up in 2016. Gets to run off the same rating as when third last year but we can’t be sure he retains his ability aged 12. He’s had just two runs this season and predictably failed to cope with soggy ground both times. Stable has been quiet for a month or two.Improved this season, winning comfortably at Ascot in November and running a fine third there the next month. Bad ground probably explains his Haydock flop in January and he’s presumably been freshened up since that most recent outing. May well have more to offer, though his stamina for this distance is in doubt.Stormed clear in the Welsh Grand National and would have done the same the previous season if he hadn’t bumped into a future Gold Cup winner in Native River. Is also a winner of the Munster National and two Cork Nationals, giving him an excellent record in big-field marathons. Gone up another 6lb to match the highest rating he’s ever had and Chepstow form does not always translate well to Aintree. He’s a hold-up horse who will therefore need luck, which he didn’t get last year, when he unseated his jockey while dodging a faller. Would be the oldest winner for 95 years but clearly is not in decline. Very dangerous if able to get into contention by the third-last.Entered the reckoning with an authoritative success in the North Yorkshire Grand National, when he made all the running. Went up a stone in the weights, which is a lot for beating five finishers who have done little for the form. That might have been his big day, in a race the trainer was winning for the third year in a row, at a course where this horse is unbeaten. But he copes well with a stamina test and could have more to offer.Has a good record round Aintree’s Mildmay course, which may not translate to the much bigger National course and fences. Disappointing when eighth there in November and had a wind operation the next month. Unraced since mid-December, an unorthodox National preparation. Likes a dry-ish surface, so could do without much rain. Fairly weighted and could get involved if everything falls right but more likely to be seeking softer targets.Tough, staying mare who is still young enough to have her best days ahead of her, being younger than any National winner since 1940. Never got into it when sixth in the 2016 Irish National and could only find the one pace when fifth in the Welsh National that year. Last seen running a fair third in Punchestown’s National Trial, giving weight to the first two, who made that form look good in the Irish National. She’s in big trouble if a turn of foot is required but, granted soft ground, she could get a lot of these in trouble by grinding along relentlessly in front.Went into a lot of notebooks as a National type when bolting up by 12 lengths in a race on the Mildmay course here two years ago, but then had to miss last year’s National after a badly timed injury. Hard to say how much ability he retains, as he’s been raced so sparingly and often over hurdles but it’s a concern that he is now older than any National winner since 1923. Leap of faith required.Stamina is the most obvious weak spot for this talented but frustrating type who appears not to be the most robust. Beaten over 100 lengths into 13th two years ago, eased down on the run-in on soft ground. Has only had two runs since, when a fine second in last year’s Kim Muir and when well beaten in the same race this year. Ground made the difference it was good when he was second, very testing when he flopped. Hard to believe he’s a National winner in waiting. Famously frustrating beast who has finished fast but too late on many a day, often after killing his chance with a mistake. Has been held back by metal pins in a back leg but the trainer says he’s moving better than ever and won a decent pot at Sandown in January. Offsetting that he ran so poorly when 12th in the 2016 National on soft ground, which should have suited, and after a much stronger season than this one.One of the least experienced in the field after just four runs over fences, of which his only win came in a 2016 beginners’ chase. Background and pedigree suggest his stamina might not stretch to a race like this and he was pulled up on his only attempt in a long-distance handicap chase. Doesn’t seem to like big fields. Rating looks a bit high. Hard to fancy.Ruined his chance last year by boiling over before the start. Did pretty well, then, to work his way into contention by the second-last but was a tired seventh in the end. Fell on his only outing since, when heavy ground did not suit. If the weather dries up and he behaves himself, it’s not beyond him to get involved off a rating that has dropped a stone and a half from his peak. He was a dual Festival winner but four years is a long time to make your supporters wait for another victory.Game and consistent, he’s already had an excellent season, winning the Tommy Whittle in December and chasing home The Dutchman in the Peter Marsh back at Haydock. Warmed up with a first hurdles success for two years. Still on a beatable rating in the right contest but this might not be it. There’s a lot more strength in depth than he’s used to meeting and all his wins have come in single-figure fields. Not the most efficient jumper, mixing flamboyant leaps with the odd mistake. He didn’t have much left at the end of his last two races.Thoroughly experienced plodder after 38 starts over fences. By no means a prolific winner in recent seasons, though he managed to nick a weak race at Sandown in November. Got round in his own time to be 10th last year, beaten by 42 lengths. Could do better if the ground is soft. Blinkers may have helped when he was third at Ascot last month and could do so again. A distant third in the Welsh National last season and has since dropped 9lb, while his stable has finally hit form after a bleak winter, so a case can be made for him plugging on into fifth, maybe.Veteran of 46 races over fences showed his wellbeing by winning round Cheltenham’s cross-country course in December. Has twice been second in the Irish National and was beaten just a short-head in 2016 under Ruby Walsh. Now 6lb higher than when second at Fairyhouse last year. Jumping has never been flawless but a clear round could easily put him in the leading bunch on the run from the third-last. Doubtful he can be fastest from there. Could do with the ground drying up.Gave a mulish display when dropping himself out in the Welsh National and was then remarkably revived by the fitting of blinkers when an easy winner of Warwick’s Classic Chase. A change of jockey may also have helped. Believing he would miss the cut for this, connections raced him in two more marathons on heavy going in the past two months, including a fair second in the Midlands National. Will have to be remarkably robust to show his best form here at the end of such a taxing season.Close second in the Badger Ales on his first run of the season but went up a few pounds and has not really shone in stronger races since. Travelled strongly in the Welsh National and Kim Muir before the limitations of his stamina appeared to be shown up in both. Was running a fair race just behind the leaders when his saddle slipped at the second Canal Turn two years ago, causing him to be pulled up. Now 7lb lower and capable of going well again, though his form this season has been patchy. Was giving lumps of weight to the first three when fourth at Chepstow in October and plugged on gamely to be fourth in the Kim Muir last month. Stamina must be in question, given he got tired and faded in the Hennessy for the last two years.Career peaked with an extremely game effort to be third in an attritional Cheltenham Gold Cup three years ago, when quality rivals like Many Clouds, Silviniaco Conti and Carlingford Lough were a long way behind. Ran to a high level for another season after that and was second in the 2016 Irish Gold Cup but has been two stones below his best in the last year. Enthusiasm seems to be on the wane, despite various bits of headgear being tried. On a dangerously low rating if he ever does bounce back to something like his best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/254e94184b68809ce0245e9a91e220ec1cf868e8/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=450d38065d774079ed1b0cc2b64812e2 1400w","title":"google loses right to be forgotten case","story":"Businessman wins legal action to force removal of search results about past convictionA businessman has won his legal action to remove search results about a criminal conviction in a landmark “right to be forgotten” case that could have wide-ranging repercussions.The ruling was made by Mr Justice Warby in London on Friday. The judge rejected a similar claim brought by a second businessman who was jailed for a more serious offence. The claimant who lost, referred to only as NT1 for legal reasons, was convicted of conspiracy to account falsely in the late 1990s the claimant who won, known as NT2, was convicted more than 10 years ago of conspiracy to intercept communications. NT1 was jailed for four years, while NT2 was jailed for six months.Granting an appeal in the case of NT1, the judge added: “It is quite likely that there will be more claims of this kind, and the fact that NT2 has succeeded is likely to reinforce that.”Both men demanded that Google remove search results mentioning the cases for which they were convicted. These include links to web pages published by a national newspaper and other media. Google refused their request and the men took the company to the high court.The decision in NT2’s favour could have implications for other convicted criminals and those who want embarrassing stories about them erased from the web. Warby ruled out any damages payment, however.Explaining his decision, the judge said NT1 continued to mislead the public, whereas NT2 had shown remorse. He also took into account the submission that NT2’s conviction did not concern actions taken by him in relation to “consumers, customers or investors”, but rather in relation to the invasion of privacy of third parties.He said his key conclusion in relation to NT2’s claim was that “the crime and punishment information has become out of date, irrelevant and of no sufficient legitimate interest to users of Google search to justify its continued availability”. In the case of NT1, however, the judge was scathing about the claimant’s position since leaving prison. “He has not accepted his guilt, has misled the public and this court, and shows no remorse over any of these matters,” he said.“He remains in business, and the information serves the purpose of minimising the risk that he will continue to mislead, as he has in the past. Delisting would not erase the information from the record altogether, but it would make it much harder to find.”In 2014 the European court of justice (ECJ) ruled that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. Since then, Google has received requests to remove at least 2.4m links from search results. Search engine firms can reject applications if they believe the public interest in accessing the information outweighs a right to privacy.At a high court hearing in February, Hugh Tomlinson QC, representing NT1, told the high court that the visibility of the articles on the search engine caused “distress and upset” to his client.Tomlinson, who is also chairman of the press regulation campaign group Hacked Off, told the court the businessman was not a public figure and now made a living from commercial lending and funding a property developer.“Before anyone meets a new person these days they Google them,” Tomlinson said. He added that many people engaged in misdeeds when they were young and if the misdeeds were constantly brought to the attention of others then they would permanently have a negative effect.NT1’s conviction was now spent, Tomlinson continued, and the law was designed to allow for the rehabilitation of offenders so they could go on to lead normal lives.But Antony White QC, representing Google, argued the ECJ’s “right to be forgotten” ruling was “not a right to rewrite history or ... tailor your past if that’s what this claimant would like to use it for”.White said the business malpractice that gave rise to NT1’s conviction was “serious and sustained”.NT2, in a separate hearing, also argued that his conviction was legally spent and he therefore had a right to be forgotten. Google resisted taking down search results linking to articles including reports on his financial affairs, his conviction and interviews given by him several years later containing his account of the circumstances surrounding his conviction.A Google spokesperson said: “We work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are in the public interest and will defend the public’s right to access lawful information. We are pleased that the court recognised our efforts in this area, and we will respect the judgments they have made in this case.”"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Though it’s a few hundred miles from the ocean, you’ll still find beaches, some of which are home to a vibrant daytime party scene. Nearby there are stunning natural wonders — mountains, lakes and hiking trails – perfect for all kinds of recreational activities. With so many options for fun in the sun, we take a look at some of the best.A full beach experience right on the Strip. Body surf in the wave pool, relax on a day bed, or take a gentle float down the lazy river. There are cabanas for all temperaments, whether you want seclusion or want to party. To really get away from the crowds, hire a cabana or gazebo with private pool and lounge area. The beach is family friendly, but head to the nearby Toptional Moorea club for a more grown-up experience.Mandalay Bay, 3950 S. Las Vegas Blvd.No need to stop the party just because the sun is shining – Wet Republic supplies the beats, dipping pools and festive atmosphere for all-day clubbing. A-list DJs, including Calvin Harris, Tiësto and Kaskade, keep the party going while there are a range of VIP options — take a bungalow for privacy and a personal jacuzzi, or be right in the action and book a banquette by the dance floor.MGM Grand, 3799 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Pick a pool. Caesars Palace has seven to choose from, each with its own theme. They all feature cabanas and day beds, so be guided by your mood. The Apollo pool receives the most sunlight, while the Jupiter is more secluded. Gamers will like the Fortuna, which has a swim-up blackjack table, while those looking for a European vibe should head for the Venus pool lounge. For the ultimate in relaxation book a massage session with Qua Baths \u0026amp Spa, which offers poolside services.Caesars Palace, 3570 S. Las Vegas Blvd.The Wynn’s day life unfolds at the Encore, a beach club that centres around its three-tiered pools. The DJ talent is world class, with the likes of the Chainsmokers, David Guetta and Diplo on the roster. Comfy cabanas come with a lush day bed, TV (who’s watching TV with a party raging outside?) and stocked fridge. Bungalow residents get extra luxuries such as a cooling system, infinity pool and, crucially, a private bathroom.Wynn Las Vegas, 3131 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Just a half-hour’s drive from the Strip is Lake Mead, a recreation area known as the most erse in America. Visitors come for year-round activities, including jet skiing, paddleboarding, sport fishing and kayaking. There are a number of picnic spots throughout the park, and for a night away from the city’s hubbub, pitch a tent in one of the 10 campgrounds, or stay at one of the lakeside resorts.The Tank, as the Golden Nugget’s pool is called, can boast what no other can: here you can swim with sharks. Well, almost. An enclosed waterslide plunges nine metres, travelling through an aquarium filled with some 300 sea creatures, including said sharks and sting rays. The H2O bar supplies the drinks, while lounging in the sun is as strenuous as things need to get if you prefer. On the third floor is the Hideout, an infinity pool for over-21s with day beds, chaise lounges and luxury cabanas.Golden Nugget, 129 E. Fremont StreetA visit to the Hoover Dam is on many a bucket list, but to really experience the magnificence of the structure hop in a kayak. As you paddle out into the Colorado River, you’ll have an epic view as the 220-metre (726-foot) dam looms above. A number of companies offer day or half-day tours that take in highlights of the Black Canyon, including sauna caves and geothermal hot springs. Desert bighorn sheep, falcons and bald eagles are some of the wildlife that you might spot. The water is flat and suitable for beginners.The Dayclub is responsible for party duties at The Cosmopolitan in the day time. Spanning the multilevel Marquee Nightclub, there are also two pools, which is where you want to be to take in the first-class DJ action, including the likes of Dash Berlin, DJ Mustard and Tritonal. Upgrade to a grand cabana for dedicated service and infinity dipping pools, or go large with a bungalow that has its own pool, party deck and sleeping quarters.The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, 3708 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Less than an hour’s drive from Las Vegas is Mount Charleston, a 3,700-metre (12,000-foot) peak that is part of the Spring Mountains, which rise spectacularly out of the Mojave desert. There are more than 50 miles of trails to explore, four campgrounds and a range of activities from horseback riding to biking. The Lee Canyon resort offers winter skiing, snowshoeing and tubing, as well as disc golf during the warmer months. Other places to stay nearby include the well-appointed Mt Charleston Las Vegas resort.It might sit atop the Downtown Grand Hotel but the vibe at this pool deck is one of backyard party. Family-friendly games include corn hole, foosball and table tennis, while there is plenty of space for lounging (cabanas are also available for hire), a full bar and a restaurant helmed by chef Scott Cummings, a former-Hell’s Kitchen winner. DJs and live entertainment also feature at weekends. As a bonus, there are superb views of downtown Las Vegas.Downtown Grand, 206 N. 3rd StreetFifteen miles west of Las Vegas sits the Red Rock Canyon Conservation Area, nearly 81,000 hectares (200,000 acres) of rugged beauty. It’s known for its hiking trails (there are 26 numbered hikes), which cater for all levels of fitness and reach from canyon floors to the highest points. A 13-mile paved road provides a scenic drive through stunning desert landscapes other activities include mountain biking, horseback riding and target shooting — it’s also a wonderful spot for stargazing.This luxurious but relaxed resort, away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip, has two pools. The M Pool is the family-friendly version it has plenty of seating and cabanas for hire, and there are two large hot tubs on the pool deck. The over-21s pool club, DayDream, open at weekends and on holidays, is much more adult focused, with bar and bottle service available as well as top-name DJs providing the tunes.M Resort Spa Casino, 12300 S.

But at the same time, we must respect neighbours’ opinions.”Klimt said the work would stay up for a short while so everyone interested could experience it. Although some people had welcomed the penis as an “important part of the debate about sexuality, body and gender”, others – especially neighbours – had “received it less well and perceived it as offensive”, she said. Atrium Ljungberg has allowed a collective of local artists, Kollektivet Livet, free rein to decorate the apartment block wall as it sees fit since 2008. The murals usually stay in place for at least six months before a new one is commissioned.Falkholt said at the unveiling that she hoped her blue penis would be better received in Stockholm than a similar pink one was when it appeared on the side of an apartment building in Manhattan’s Lower East Side in December. The New York work was painted over within three days instead of the intended three weeks after similar complaints from locals. But Falkholt said on Wednesday she thought the reaction in her native Sweden would be different. “I think perhaps it will be allowed to remain here, people will get the message and let it take its place in the debate,” she said. “I think there’s more intellectual space to discuss the subject, in a nuanced way.” She said she liked to think of the Stockholm painting – titled Fuck the World – as “a reincarnation”. Falkholt could not be reached for comment on Friday.

I didn’t realise how much I had lost over the period of time. I can focus better. I can read faster. I’m doing yoga three times per week, which helps the muscles heal properly.“All the nerves that were clutched around the transplant want to kind of bunch down but I used yoga to pull them apart so I’m getting as much strength into my body as possible. I’m doing cardio three times per week. It’s phenomenal.“I found myself walking in the park with my mum the other day and I had to stop. I was overwhelmed because I wasn’t getting tired and I wasn’t getting breathless, which would have been a normal occurrence for the past two years, even with oxygen.”Ms Tinsley urged people to have conversations about organ donation with their families and to consider signing up as donors.“I was getting emotional because I was thinking of my donor and their sacrifice, generosity, and forward thinking,” she said. “Their ability to have the conversation with their family beforehand, and when tragically they died, they gave me life.“It is the greatest legacy anyone could ever give to someone else. I just hope that people will consider being organ donors. I’m very thankful for all the incredible support I’ve had from Ireland and people here in the US too.“It was really amazing that people saw my story and decided they wanted to become organ donors.“When I woke up from my transplant in the intensive care unit and was recovering, I got a lot of tweets from people in Ireland with photos of the organ donor card they were signing. That was an essential part of my recovery and it still is.”Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Cystic fibrosis campaigner is in recovery following operation in DecemberArlene Foster asked of focus on details and minute-taking around \u0026lsquocash for ash\u0026rsquo schemeAoife Walsh was three when the Jack Russell bit her on the lips and swung her side to sideCivilian Andrew McLindon tells Charleton he would have been \u0026lsquoappalled\u0026rsquo at suggestionProtest before Ulster-Ospreys match follows conclusion of Belfast rape trailNew hospital access strategy announced as 504,000-plus on medical procedures queueDavid Drumm trial hears of \u0026euro7.2 billion transactions between Anglo and ILP in 2008Noel Cantwell led United to FA Cup win in 1963, but cricket was his first love, says familyChristopher Timmons too busy to carry out the 200 hours community service imposedScouting Ireland chief says organisation to address concerns \u0026lsquowithout delay\u0026rsquoRelatives of the 48 young people who died in 1981 fire say AG notified of plan to apply for fresh inquestR\u0026oacuteis\u0026iacuten Morelli alleges State has failed to vindicate her right to vote as Irish citizenFianna F\u0026aacuteil TD John McGuinness calls for calm at heated meetingWilliam McFadden, ( 72), was charged with criminal damage and a breach of the peaceLeo Varadkar refers to \u0026lsquoprevalence of pornography\u0026rsquo in social-media age and urges better relationship educationBishop of Limerick says repeal is \u0026lsquoentirely consistent\u0026rsquo with COI view on abortionCourt grants emergency care order for primary school boySaturday\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoBeo, Gaelach \u0026amp Br\u0026oacuted\u0026uacuteil\u0026rsquo is billed as one of the main events of Bliain na Gaeilge 2018Company temporarily restricted some activists\u0026rsquo messages recently while carrying out investigationThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3460020.1523612445!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ulster rugby and irfu officials under pressure from sponsors","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaddy Jackson was cleared of the charges on March 28th. Photograph: PacemakerUlster Rugby and IRFU officials are coming under increasing pressure from sponsors to effectively deal with “issues” raised during the trial of Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding. Official Ulster Rugby shirt sponsor Bank of Ireland (BoI) has said it is “highly concerned” about the “serious behaviour and conduct issues” that emerged in the trial involving the two players, who, at Belfast Crown Court last month, were cleared of raping the same woman in 2016.The bank, a key sponsor of the club for 20 years, has been in touch with Ulster Rugby chief executive Shane Logan regarding the case.“It is of paramount importance to Bank of Ireland that our sponsorship activity aligns with and supports our core values, and reflects positively on Bank of Ireland through association,” a BoI statement said. “We understand that an internal review is under way. We expect this review to be robust, to fully address the issues raised, and that decisions will be taken – and policies and protocols be put in place – that fully address the issues that have arisen.”Following the conclusion of the trial on March 28th when both men were cleared of all charges, and two of their friends were also acquitted on related charges, Ulster and the IRFU said they were conducting an internal review into the two players who have been “relieved of all duties” since the legal process began. The degrading and offensive WhatsApp messages exchanged between the players and their friends, including another rugby player Craig Gilroy, who is also subject to the internal review over a message he sent Mr Olding, were under intense scrutiny during the trial and since its conclusion.Street demonstrations have taken place in cities across Ireland, and a feminist protest planned for outside Ulster’s King Stadium in south Belfast is scheduled for Friday evening. King, which is headquartered in Cavan, is the main sponsor of Ulster Rugby. It has been a partner since 1999 and in the summer of 2014 announced a 10-year agreement for the naming rights of the stadium. A spokesman for the company did not respond to a number requests for a statement. A spokeswoman for main kit sponsor Kukri Sports said: “I have no comment.”A spokeswoman for another official shirt sponsor, BT, said: “As a sponsor of the team, we have been in contact with Ulster Rugby. “We note that the players concerned will continue to be relieved of all duties while the IRFU and Ulster Rugby internal review is under way, and we await the findings.”A spokesman for shirt sponsor Go Power said: “Our legal team have been liaising with their PR department.” All other “official” or “domestic” sponsors listed on the Ulster Rugby website were contacted by The Irish Times on Thursday. SONI (System Operator for Northern Ireland) spokeswoman Natasha Sayee said its concerns had been expressed to Ulster Rugby and it awaited the outcome of the review. “As sponsors of the Ulster Rugby Premiership, we seek to support the values of respect, integrity and inclusivity at community and grassroots level,” she said. “It is vital to SONI that the outcome of the review addresses all of these issues.”Danske Bank is the official sponsor of the Ulster Schools’ Cup competition held each year from November to March, plus the Girls Schools’ Cup and High Schools’ Trophy. A statement said: “Danske Bank has not taken a formal position on the matter, nor have we had any contact with Ulster Rugby.”A Moy Park spokeswoman said: “The company is an official supplier to Ulster Rugby. It would be inappropriate to comment further as Ulster Rugby and the IRFU are conducting an internal review.”A Dale Farm spokeswoman said: “Dale Farm fully respects Ulster Rugby and IRFU’s current internal investigation and as such is not in a position to comment on this matter.”An Ulster Carpets spokeswoman said: “Ulster Carpets are fully aware of the situation and will be awaiting the outcome of the review being carried out by Ulster Rugby and the IRFU before making any comment.”An Abbey Insurance spokeswoman said: “Thank you for the opportunity, but at this stage Abbey Insurance is not making any comment in relation to this matter.”A Deep River Rock spokeswoman said it would not be commenting on this matter. A Maxol spokesperson said: “Maxol sponsors the Ulster Mini Rugby Festivals programme which aims to give young players aged 6 - 12 years old their first taste of the sport as well as learning the basic skills that go behind it. On other matters we don’t feel it is appropriate to comment at this time.”A response from the following companies was not available at the time of publication: Subway Ernst and Young Bavarian A\u0026ampL Goodbody Tobermore Concrete Products Ltd Fonacab Argento CD Group Heineken Millar McCall Wylie First Trust Bank and Kerr’s Tyres.An Ulster Rugby statement said: “The IRFU and Ulster Rugby have advised that a review process in relation to this matter is underway and it would be inappropriate to comment on any matter pertaining to that process until it is completed.”In the “sponsorship opportunities” section of the Ulster Rugby website it says it and the IRFU Ulster Branch are “committed to building a team from grass roots level up, making this the perfect opportunity for sponsors keen to harness a community ethos, not just in Northern Ireland but with border counties in Ulster”.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3461173.1523645894!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"women s rights activists stage rally outside ulster rugby ground","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUlster rugby protest: demonstrators at King Stadium in Belfast on Friday. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWomen’s rights activists have staged a demonstration outside Ulster Rugby’s grounds in south Belfast, saying it should “stamp out misogyny”.Belfast Feminist Network organised the rally close to one of King Stadium’s entrances, ahead of Friday evening’s game against the Ospreys, to send a message to sports officials about the responsibilities it says they have.On March 28th the Ulster and Ireland players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding were acquitted of raping a woman in June 2016. Mr Jackson was also cleared of sexual assault.Since the trial ended there has been a focus on WhatsApp exchanges between the players and their friends, including their fellow rugby player Craig Gilroy.Mr Jackson, Mr Olding and Mr Gilroy are subject to an ongoing internal review by Ulster and IRFU officials regarding their futures.Kellie Turtle of Belfast Feminist Network said Ulster Rugby had a duty to “stamp out misogyny” from within its own community. She said the activists had gathered peacefully on Mount Merrion Avenue to highlight wider demands regarding reform of the criminal-justice system and media reporting of rape trials.They were also calling for more resources for support services for victims and survivors and for fact-based schools education programmes on consent for all pupils. “We want to make sure that there is no institution in this country that can’t be held to account regarding misogyny and sexism.”As fans poured into what is known as the home of Ulster Rugby, a man wearing an Ulster Rugby jacket and his daughter – who was wearing an ‘I support Paddy Jackson’ T-shirt – stopped by protesters so he could photograph the girl in front of the banners.Among the estimated 250 protesters holding placards featuring slogans such as “Stand up for the Ulster women too”, “What if it was your daughter?” and “Respect”, one woman activist shouted at him: “Father of the year”.A 42-year-old woman at the game with her son said: “Fair play to the protesters. I don’t even know how the Ulster review would resolve all this. There are so many strands to it now. It’s difficult to explain to my son about why the women are protesting.”When she then attempted to explain to the nine-year-old boy that the women were protesting because they want everyone to be treated well, he said: “Then why can’t I get to protest?”Dan Hollington, from Belfast via London, said: “It’s such a regrettable incident, the whole thing. I know inevitably sport is political, but it’s best to keep things on pitch. It’s a shame for the club it’s been so isive. I think it’s a shame for this on top. But people are entitled to express opinions. Anything to reduce misogyny in sport or facet of life is great, so I support it.”Another man said: “I can understand why they are here, but it won’t stop me supporting Ulster.”Karen Woods from Lisburn said: “I know who they are, but I don’t agree with them being here. The boys were found innocent.”Men and women in passing cars beeped their horns, apparently in solidarity with protesters.The Green Party MLA Clare Bailey, a former employee of the Nexus NI rape and sexual-abuse charity, who was at the rally, says she was concerned by how long the review, which has no specific timescale, could take.“I don’t understand why Ulster Rugby are taking so long with this review,” she said. “The messages and conduct of the players have been in the public realm for some time now. We are outside the grounds now, but next we could be looking at the publicly concerned Ulster sponsors if they can lend weight to a resolution.”Ms Bailey said she had been heartened by the response from people to the activism of the broader Northern Ireland Women’s Rights Movement since the trial concluded, on March 28th. “The women of Ireland are mobilising,” she said. “They have had their moment. This is not going away, you know. I think the people here tonight are legends.”Anne Madden from Belfast said she was at the rally “to show solidarity with the many women and men outraged by the behaviour of these high profile sportsmen”. She added: “This case has highlighted depraved views of women that have no place in the 21st century or a civilised society that values all their citizens whatever their gender. Time’s up: it’s time to stamp out misogyny.”When asked for a response to the demonstration taking place outside its stadium an Ulster Rugby spokesman said it had worked closely with the PSNI and Belfast City Council “to put appropriate measures in place to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for all supporters”.An advance request from the The Irish Times Northern correspondent for media accreditation to Friday evening’s game was not approved on the grounds that Ulster “have to give priority to sports journalists”.A follow-up request for access to a seat in a stand nearby the media facilities was also not approved.As well as the Ulster and IRFU internal review, the Office of the Attorney General of Northern Ireland is investigating possible contempt of court by a juror in the trial of the players who made comments about it online.There is no set timescale for this either. A spokesman said: “The investigation is still ongoing.”Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition. In a malnourished population the disease severity and duration of an infectious disease can be much greater.”Researchers are now conducting a follow-up study to assess whether the nutritional situation has changed.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Donald Trump pardons Dick Cheney\u0026#39s former adviser \u0026#39Scooter\u0026#39 Libby, convicted of perjuryPolitician from Angela Merkel\u0026#39s party \u0026#39open to talks with AfD\u0026#39\u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 terrorist suspected of helping to plot drive-by executions of British police and soldiers, it emergesWhite House in turmoil amid fears FBI seized tapes of conversations between Donald Trump and his lawyerCampers wait outside Lindo Wing ready for new royal babyXi Jinping plans live-fire drills in Taiwan Strait after biggest naval exercises in China\u0026#39s historyComment: Will the BBC broadcasting Enoch Powell\u0026#39s Rivers of Blood speech do us any harm?

Fourteen days of strikes have already hit 65 universities since 22 February.But members of the UCU voted to call off more action after bosses at Universities UK agreed a joint panel would be set up to reassess the pension issue.The news was welcomed by the National Union of Students (NUS), with estimates suggesting up to 1 million students were affected by previous walkouts.Shakira Martin, NUS president, said: “We are pleased to see a deal has been reached. Students have wholeheartedly chosen to support their staff during this dispute, and we have seen inspiring displays of solidarity on campuses across the UK since day one.”Students to face disruption as union reveals university strike dates#NoCapitulation: Striking university staff want to reject pension dealUniversity strikes could be called off after pensions breakthroughStrike-hit students set to get compensation, minister saysProtesters storm lecture hall as university strike anger boils overThe strikes were called after Universities UK revealed plans to change the Universities Superannuation Scheme from a defined benefit scheme – which gives a guaranteed retirement income – to a defined contribution scheme, which would make pensions vulnerable to changes in the stock market. Universities UK had said the alterations would help make up a £6bn deficit.But, with the proposals now dropped, members of the UCU voted almost two to one to stop more walkouts and instead reopen negotiations. There was a record 63.5 per cent turn out, the union said.Sally Hunt, UCU general secretary, said: “The union has come a very long way since January when it seemed that the employers’ proposals for a defined contribution pension were to be imposed.“Now we have agreement to move forward jointly, looking again at the USS valuation alongside a commitment from the employers to a guaranteed, defined benefit scheme.”And she added: “We hope this important agreement will hearten workers across the UK fighting to defend their pension rights and was won through the amazing strike action of UCU members.“UCU has more work to do to ensure that the agreement delivers the security in retirement that university staff deserve.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesEngland\u0027s Katarina Johnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the heptathlon with compatriot and bronze medal winner Niamh Emerson during the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia.Quaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Poor Coleridge was moved from a tip to a tip – they put the coffins in a convenient space which was dry and secure, and quite suitable, bricked them up and forgot about them, and never did anything about the rest of the space.”James Comey’s new book likens Donald Trump to a mob bossMaya Angelou’s extraordinary life and most beloved poemThe coffins are barely visible through a ventilation block in the wall, which was built in the 1960s, and were discovered during an excavation which uncovered the wine vault entrance. Coleridge suffered from depression, poor health and drug and alcohol addiction in his life. His final 18 years were spend lodging across the green from the church with a doctor he hoped could cure him. He died aged 61 in July 1834.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The regulations will then be allowed to expire.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesIndian activists gather to show support for the chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women Swati Maliwal, who is on a hunger strike against the alleged rapes in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, in New Delhi, India.

In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the reasons for his decision, according to reports, was the frustration he has working with Donald Trump.“I think we have achieved a heck of a lot. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly,” Mr Ryan said at a press conference in Washington. “But I gave it everything I could ... I have no regrets.”News of the the departure of Mr Ryan, who will serve out his term and retire in January, was first reported by Axios. “House Republicans were already in very tough spot for midterms, with many endangered members and the good chance that Democrats will win the majority,” the website said.“Friends say that after Ryan passed tax reform, his longtime dream, he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating, in part because of President Trump.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesIndian activists gather to show support for the chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women Swati Maliwal, who is on a hunger strike against the alleged rapes in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, in New Delhi, India.

According to Riverside County Sheriffs, David Allen Turpin and Louise Anna Turpin held 13 malnourished children ranging in age from 2 to 29 captive in their Perris, California home. Deputies were alerted after a 17-year-old daughter escaped by jumping through a window shortly before dawn, carrying a de-activated mobile phone from which she was able to call 911 for help. Responding deputies described conditions in the home as foul-smelling with some kids chained to a bed and suffering injuries as a result. Adult children appeared at first to be minors because of their malnourished state. The Turpins were arrested on charges of torture and child endangerment.Mr Ryan, who was Mitt Romney’s Republican running mate in 2012, become Speaker in 2015 after Tea Party activists effectively forced out John Boehner. He took the job, with some anxieties, and with a reputation as a straight but rather uncharismatic policy wonk.Mr Ryan denied that he was resigning because of concerns about the plight of the Republicans. He also dismissed a suggestion it was because he found it difficult to work with Mr Trump.“I’m grateful for the opportunity he has given us to do big things,” he said, adding how proud he had been to help pass last year’s tax cut, the biggest since 1986.It is possible that Mr Ryan, who did not run for the presidency as part of a huge Republican field in 2016, could yet return to the political fray. Paul Ryan on Pennsylvania’s special congressional race: Both candidates ran as ConservativesMr Ryan, who said he was inspired to enter public service after reading the words of the late Russian-American novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, has long harboured ambitions about the White House, and reports suggested he could yet make another run. It is possible he could decide to be mainstream Republican primary challenger to President Trump if the billionaire decides to seek re-election in 2020, something he has indicated  he plans to do.Reports said Mr Ryan may have thought twice to publicise any planned departure, because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow Republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the House of Representatives. Yet he said he would continue to hold the position of Speaker and then stand down in January. To run for re-election in November, and then resign two months later, would be acting in an honest way to the people he represented, he said.“I really do not believe whether I stay or go will affect how a person running for congress does,” he said. “If we do our jobs, as we are, we’re going to have a great record to run on.” Mr Ryan said he had spent 20 years in congress, and that if he were to stay for one more term, his children would only know him as a weekend dad. “I can’t let that happen.”  Faith leaders arrested at DACA protest outside Paul Ryan’s office Paul Ryan suggests he has enough votes to prevent government shutdownUS Speaker Paul Ryan calls for a ‘cleanse’ of the FBIMore than three dozen House Republicans have announced that they are retiring, running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 24 seats in the November elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Mr Ryan has made little effort to hide his disdain for Mr Trump, his style as a politician or his rhetoric. After an Access Hollywood video was released shortly before the election in 2016, in which Mr Trump was recorded apparently bragging about sexually assaulting women, Mr Ryan condemned the candidate’s comments.“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” he said. “I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and works to demonstrate that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests.”It subsequently emerged that the Speaker had been even more outspoken privately. An audio recording published in March 2017, two months after President Trump had entered the White House, revealed Mr Ryan telling House Republicans at the time of the Access Hollywood’s release that he would “no longer defend” the New York billionaire.“I am not going to defend Donald Trump – not now, not in the future,” he said. “To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. “Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you.”As it was, Mr Ryan appeared to mend fences with Mr Trump, or at least pretended to, and campaigned for him in his home state of Wisconsin – a state that the brash former reality television star was able to capture by less than 23,000 votes, and which was crucial to him entering the White House.“This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,” Mr Ryan said after Mr Trump had won.“Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no else did. He turned politics on its head.”Mr Trump praised Mr Ryan after the announcement. Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question, he said.
