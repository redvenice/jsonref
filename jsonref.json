In particular, officers were worried we would challenge Beech’s allegations.‘Seeing an inidual make allegations and then be targeted by the media is not going to encourage others to speak out,’ it said. The reaction was revealing. It exposed the police’s only real tactic at the time: believe the accuser and go for maximum publicity no matter how threadbare the evidence and hope other accusers will come forward. It was a technique that was to ruin the reputations of blameless men. And their statement exposed an even more worrying flaw. In bending over backwards to be seen to believe these allegations, they lost sight of basic detective work.         All it took to expose Carl Beech’s lurid fantasy was a single phone call. One of his central claims was that a well-connected paedophile had knocked down and killed one of his school friendsShortly after the Panorama documentary aired in October 2015, I travelled to the West Country to meet Beech’s ex-wife, Dawn. She had seen the show and worked out that her husband of 22 years was the accuser then using the pseudonym ‘Nick’.Detectives had not spoken to her, either. But it was quickly apparent they should have done. Her evidence would later become a crucial part of the court case against Beech.She told us that Beech had never mentioned being abused by a high-ranking paedophile ring, though he said he had been abused by his stepfather. She said he consistently spent beyond his means. Could this have been a motive for his lies? The police failed to make even the most cursory checks. Their fear of losing Beech’s confidence was, I understand, behind a high-level decision not to analyse his computers and phones – a decision that put children at risk.For two years, until the case was taken over by a different force, Beech was able to indulge his interest in photographing young boys and fuelling a market of horrific child sex abuse images.It was right that Scotland Yard treat people reporting childhood sexual abuse with the greatest sensitivity. But their duty is to listen respectfully and investigate properly, not to uncritically swallow the stories they are told."},{"url":null,"title":"Nine ten parents admit annoyed children return home university","story":"Share this article          The most common gripes from parents include the extra laundry they have to deal with and dirty crockery being left around the houseThree in ten moaned about the house being noisier, and almost a fifth used the classic complaint that their returning children treated the family home ‘like a hotel’.One in ten was annoyed about having to cater once more for specialist diets, such as vegan, vegetarian or gluten-free.Nearly three in ten did not like having to wait to get into the bathroom, and dirty laundry being left on the floor annoyed more than half of parents.Other common complaints revealed in the survey, which was commissioned by supermarket chain Aldi, were youngsters not eating meals that had been cooked for them, borrowing money, and hogging the TV remote control. "},{"url":null,"title":"Philip Hammond plots Labour stop No Deal","story":"Share this article It is though their favoured approach is to amend existing Brexit-related legislation to force the PM to seek a further delay if no deal has been agreed as the deadline approaches. Mr Hammond and a number of other Tory MPs have not ruled out the \u0027nuclear option\u0027 of voting against Mr Johnson in a no confidence vote.    Mr Hammond is also said to have been holding talks with his former cabinet colleague David Gauke, the ex-justice secretary, on how to kick-start the \u0027no to No Deal\u0027 campaign.  \u0027The plan is for a huge national campaign a bit like the People\u0027s Vote, which will mobilise MPs and voters with adverts, rallies and original research,\u0027 a source familiar with discussions told The Sunday Times.\u0027Philip is talking to people and there will be no shortage of support from donors.

As in past sweeps, many were only held for a matter of hours.Police put participation at more than 3,500 people, of whom it said around 700 people were journalists and bloggers.

Reuters witnesses said some of those detained appeared to be ordinary passersby in the wrong place at the wrong time.Though Putin\u0027s approval rating is still high at well over 60 percent, it is lower than it used to be due to discontent over years of falling incomes. Last year, the 66-year-old former KGB intelligence officer won a landslide re-election and a new six-year term until 2024.Burnishing his man of action image, Putin spent Saturday ing to the bottom of the Gulf of Finland in a mini-submarine to honour a Soviet submarine that sunk there in World War Two.           Russian president Vladimir Putin ed to the bottom of the Gulf of Finland yesterday aboard a submersible to explore a Soviet submarine which was sunk during World War Two         Among the Russian military assets on display was the Korolyov large landing ship, which was pictured releasing a BTR-82A amphibious armoured personnel carrier into the water in St Petersburg       This Russian rescue crew member looked to be having a little too much fun as he leaped into the water while wearing his buoyant waterproof suit          The rescue personnel demonstrated their impressive floating suits by lying on the surface of the water during today\u0027s parade         Members of the navy also took part in a demonstration of a water rescue and they stood out in their bright orange waterproof suits         Last month, Putin taunted the UK over the Tory leadership race by suggesting that Russia was more of a democracy than Britain.

The crime isn’t the centre of the story, more its impact on Beetle’s CEO, Guy, whose aura rests on the accuracy of his predictive algorithms, which – nourished by 247 surveillance of everything from browser history to heart rate – are supposed to pre‑empt such atrocities.The early part of the novel catalogues the ills of life in a data-driven dictatorship, in which the poor are jailed before they can commit crimes, and you need BeetleBits, Beetle’s cryptocurrency, for “basic functioning in society”. But you can only earn them by working for Beetle, which only hires the best a degree helps, but universities only accept payment in… you guessed it.Policing is down to Anti-Terror Droids, which compound the error of not catching Mann by instead executing an innocent veteran, Lionel Bigman, in yet another “Zed moment” – Beetle’s term for random mishaps, by which it seeks to wash its hands of responsibility. This hardly plays well with Guy’s prospective business partners in China.Subplots fizz everywhere – including Guy’s wife pointedly revenge-sleeping with a bookseller fond of letter writing. But the main thread hangs on a rebel movement, the League of the Unverifieds, whose radical underground action prompts a crisis of conscience in a bought-off newspaper editor, David Strachey (who reported Bigman’s killing as “suicide by droid”), while affirming the doubts of Eloise Jayne, a counterterrorist sceptical of the 21st-century sus laws she’s ordered to enforce.A brainy, bustling novel, Zed is hugely enjoyable as well as hard going at times: robotic chit-chat from ubiquitous Very Intelligent Personal Assistants, as well as a blizzard of acronyms and Beetle’s own Newspeak (“Bespoke”), added to the fact that much of the firm’s senior-level discussion takes place in virtual reality, or “Real Virtuality” (in which, for instance, “the Real Douglas Varley” speaks alongside “the actually real Douglas Varley”), can make for a bumpy ride.What’s great about it, though, is that Kavenna uses her scenario not only for horror, but laughter, too, as a send-up of corporate hubris and government heedlessness. Beetle targets London because the UK is “the most advanced benign regulatory environment in the world” the prime minister is mentioned for the first time only a few pages from the end, and even then Kavenna says her name isn’t important. As for Brexit? Compared with Beetle, or whichever voracious duosyllable it’s a proxy for, it seems to be irrelevant, which may be this madcap satire’s most chilling point.• Zed by Joanna Kavenna is published by Faber \u0026amp Faber (£16.99).

The scheme opened in October.The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) gives regulatory approval for British-made parts to be used throughout the EU, but that ability will lapse if the UK leaves without a deal.The number of applications by UK firms for EU authorisation to cover themselves for a no-deal Brexit has tripled between December and July. In December 2018, the  revealed that only 200 UK aerospace manufacturers had applied to come under the jurisdiction of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as third-country parties, suggesting many firms would not have been prepared for a no-deal Brexit on 29 March.Manufacturers which have not received authorisations from the EASA or other European aviation authorities would be unable to sell new parts to European customers, dealing a potentially crippling blow to many UK exporters.The latest total of applications submitted by UK firms to the EASA for third-country certificates is 636, according to European commission sources, while about 10 more are in the process of completing their applications, almost four months after the date when the UK was first scheduled to leave the EU.The aerospace lobby group ADS estimates that about 800 companies will eventually need new regulatory arrangements under a no-deal Brexit.While the regulatory changes do not involve major job moves out of the UK, industry insiders said it could contribute towards making the UK less attractive for future inward investment. If the UK leaves the EU with a deal the EASA applications will immediately lapse, as CAA approvals will continue to be valid across Europe.British manufacturers Rolls-Royce, Cobham and Meggitt are among the 636 businesses that have applied to the EASA. Canada’s Bombardier and the US company GE Aviation, which both have significant operations in the UK, have also applied.The UK narrowly avoided leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March after the EU agreed to extend the negotiating period, following the then prime minister Theresa May’s repeated failures to pass her withdrawal bill.The aerospace industry has been among the most forthright in its opposition to leaving the UK without a deal. Airbus, Europe’s largest aerospace company, has warned it will consider closing British factories in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Paul Everitt, ADS’s chief executive, said the industry faces another “challenging period” as it looks to buy warehouse and transport space during the peak pre-Christmas period. Firms are also being forced to tie up money rebuilding stockpiles.Everitt called for the government to provide a temporary VAT holiday to businesses if there is a no-deal Brexit, and added that the government should work with banks to temporarily relax loan repayment terms.Other industries have also been forced to plan for a no-deal Brexit. The chemicals industry, Britain’s biggest goods exporter, has faced a similar search for new regulators. Sixty-six applications have been made for a new competent authority to regulate their use of poisonous chemicals – up from 50 applications made by February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59d81b93c2c575390dfdc0b2417a039aada3a22d/193_381_5103_3063/master/5103.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8ecf64e08f0409ac15f6561c333ed72","title":"the short story of a long paddle on the leeds and liverpool canal a poem","story":"The illustrated city: This week we combine poetry and illustration to explore the story of Britain’s waterwaysThis week, to celebrate our Canal Revolution series, we’ve combined a fictionalised portrait of a London canal, above, with a poem from the British canal laureate, Nancy Campbell.On the first day, the water was so lowit was a challenge to climb downfrom the scorched towpathinto my boat.

In times past, it was simple. The monarch, not just a symbol of society but then its embodiment, proffered wealth, land and title. In these halcyon days of democracy, neither the Queen nor the prime minister can give chums and lackeys pots of gold and tracts of Lincolnshire, but some things stay the same: on our behalf, they still distribute preferment in the form of honours.It is truly an anachronism and by tinkering with its flaws, those who control the system yearly seek to make it more reflective of a modern age. But they delude themselves, for even on its own terms as a rough and ready mechanism for giving all sections of society the chance to be recognised for outstanding service and contribution, the system does not work.We hand out about 2,000 honours each year in the Queen’s birthday honours list and the new year honours list. But there’s an issue those who administer the process are loth to recognise.This system of societal reward carries on against the backdrop of a never-ending drumbeat of appeals, indeed an insistence, that Britons from minority backgrounds should play a full and constructive role in making this a fair and equal society. But it is a system that speaks not of Britain today or even the Britain of this century, but of Britain and its long-passed empire. It offers honours in our name, such as Order of the British Empire, that many deserving people – artists, musicians, doctors, professors, sports stars, activists, politicians – cannot in good conscience accept.For many minorities, the empire is much more than a historical footnote. Its enduring symbols and psychological legacies remain a live issue and an open wound. To accept this type of preferment is to attach them inextricably to a thing that they despise to forge a link with Britain’s past that would, to many they respect or might wish to represent, be unacceptable. Is that desirable or right? Having spent time speaking to minority Britons who have been obliged to confront this dilemma, I don’t think it is.I don’t want to overstate the case. Minority Britain is not a monolith. Some nominated minority Britons go happily to Buckingham Palace, unencumbered by qualms or the baggage of empire. I asked Samir Shah, the celebrated TV executive and former chair of the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, how long it took him to accept his OBE in 2000 (upgraded this year to a CBE). “A nanosecond,” he told me.But others have refused outright. Think of the writer Benjamin Zephaniah, who roundly and very publicly rejected an OBE in 2003. “I thought that it wasn’t just good enough for me to just say no and just leave it quietly,” he told me. “I think I had to make a big statement to people generally, but especially to people in my community, to say, look, we don’t have to do this.”Then there’s Howard Gayle, the first black footballer to break through into the Liverpool team in the 1980s and now a tireless community worker. He told me his decision to turn down an MBE for his work with the anti-racism group Kick It Out was a no-brainer. “We’ve got a long history in colonialism and slavery and we’ve never, ever been thought of as a culture deserving of an apology for what was done to us and to our ancestors.”Both men made a choice and happily live with it. But I say they shouldn’t have had to make it. Both accept honours from within their own communities. It’s the mainstream honours, wider society’s mode of recognition, they have a specific problem with.For some, the decision can be agonising. Should they accept an honour they may want and feel they deserve, knowing that to do so leaves them open to sometimes very public and always very hurtful censure and hostility? The broadcaster and community activist Dotun Adebayo, who was appointed MBE in 2009 for services to the arts, told me of receiving his offer in the post. He handed the letter to his mother-in-law. “I was thinking this is an issue now. I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to accept this. So I wasn’t jumping for joy,” Adebayo said. In the end, he took the medal from the Princess Royal. Last year, conflicted again as the Windrush scandal played out, with all its resonance of betrayal and bad faith, he sought advice from readers of the black newspaper the Voice as to whether he should send it back.The author and columnist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown took an MBE in 2001, but “shamed”, as she puts it, by a TV appearance opposite Zephaniah in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war, she packaged it up and sent it back. Tragi-comically, she was unsure who to return it to. “It stuck in my throat,” she told me. “Anybody who knows anything knows that that history will never be over in the United Kingdom. It’s in the blood and we’ve seen it all rise up again after Brexit. For all sorts of reasons, I should never have taken it.”Last month, Simon Woolley, the co-founder and director of Operation Black Vote and chair of the government’s race equality audit panel, became Sir Simon Woolley. He had been tipped off that an offer might come and spent two months wrestling with it. “It was awful,” he told me. “There were two voices. One said to me, ‘Please, you must accept.’ The other asked, ‘What am I accepting?’ I sat down during those two months and, whichever way I dressed it up, I couldn’t see anything positive about the empire.” He discerned positives in the recognition of Operation Black Vote and opportunities for his future equalities work. His research established his knighthood was a medieval title and empire was not mentioned in the announcement or citation. That was a relief. But should people – of low or high station, famous or unknown – have to agonise in this way?Fifteen years ago, when a select committee reviewed our honours system, it said the OBE, shorn of empire, should become the Order of British Excellence, because “the current nomenclature of honours makes it difficult for some potential recipients to accept them”. MPs didn’t think they were asking for a great deal, but it was too much for traditionalists.The empire has gone but we cling to its traces. Just recently, hard Brexit types have been dreaming of a Commonwealth association that might be seen as Empire 2.0. If ultra-conservatives truly insist on the right to maintain an empire link to public reward, couldn’t we at least offer conscientious objectors a parallel societal recognition they can easily accept? MPs new to the House of Commons are allowed to swear or affirm, with neither approach deemed inferior nor superior. So are witnesses in British courts, a tradition stretching back to the 17th century, when it was feared criminals were going free because Quakers would not swear on the Bible in court. Why not extend the same concept of reasonable accommodation to our honours?The receipt of honours should be a celebratory moment. For most people, it is. But there’s an empire problem: it’s well known, long established and easily remedied. A system that makes it morally difficult for deserving people to accept society’s gratitude is not fit for purpose.The Empire Strikes Black is on Radio 4 at 8pm on Monday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54b978746540ec7d142ba6ab8dd285bb5436418/0_75_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34ee893abb1057af315eb32d181ef61c","title":"ottawa the ultimate seven day itinerary","story":"Where else can you cycle river paths, shop farmers’ markets, and watch city lights from a hot tub? Welcome to Ottawa – Canada’s bustling capitalMondayOttawa’s most notable building is its majestic gothic parliament and it’s one of the landmarks you can take in when exploring the city on foot. Try Ottawa Walking Tours, Ottawa Free Tours, or your own river- and canal-side wanderings on paths around Parliament Hill. For bygone tales of brawling French and Irish gangs, don’t miss the city history on show at the old stone Bytown Museum. Finish the day at ByWard Market, the hub of the city’s most happening central district and one of Canada’s oldest and biggest public markets. Shop the unique stores along the market streets and cobblestone courtyards. You can sip on a locally brewed craft beer and try a gourmet hotdog at Tavern on the Hill, with a spectacular view of Parliament Hill.TuesdayIf the weather’s fair then don’t wait to head to the Gatineau Hills. The Gatineau Park Visitor Centre will help you choose the right hiking trail and is located in the village of Chelsea, where the Nordik Spa-Nature vies with Le Pub Chelsea as the best place to unravel after a day in the hills. Which is better: a view of Ottawa’s twinkling city lights from a hot tub, or a craft brew in a gregarious country tavern? Best do both to check.With both central Ottawa and its most attractive park under your belt, it’s time to explore everything in between. This is best done by bike and RentABike has a good selection of tours and downloadable routes. Key options follow the city’s waterways: the Rideau canal loop connects attractive neighbourhoods such as Little Italy and The Glebe with waterfalls the longer Ottawa River paths provide grand city views.Before you head out, limber up at the free drop-in Parliament Hill yoga session (summer Wednesdays at noon). You’ll be among hundreds, so no need to worry about smooth moves – though PM Justin Trudeau has been known to pop by and greet participants. Try trendy Hintonburg for a delicious meal at Supply and Demand or Bar Laurel.At least one day in Ottawa should be devoted to its terrific national museums – they’re all free on Thursdays 5-8pm, though three hours is rarely enough. With Canada’s National Museums Passport, you can choose admission to any three museums for just $35.Guarded by a giant Louise Bourgeois spider sculpture, the National Gallery of Canada is memorable for its indigenous art. If you like this, then visit the ethnographic collections of the wide-ranging Canadian Museum of History, whose on-site Children’s Museum is in a class of its own for educational interactive play.There’s more education and play, along with painstakingly made dioramas of wildlife habitats, at the Canadian Museum of Nature. For a change of pace, try the Canadian War Museum, whose coverage of Canadian conflicts and military hardware collection is moving and engaging. There’s also the chance to continue your museum visit after hours – on specific Fridays the Canadian Museum of Nature turns the museum into an adult zone, with music and mingling.You could grab a nightcap at Copper Spirits \u0026amp Sights, the rooftop patio of the Andaz Ottawa Byward Market hotel, and watch the sunset.Enjoy Ottawa’s out-of-town attractions before the weekend crowds arrive. Parc Omega is a Canadian safari park with deer, elk, caribou, bison, bears and wolves – you can even feed many of them. There’s more action to be found at the Great Canadian Bungee, where North America’s highest jump (61 metres) and a giant zip-line are located beside a pleasant little beach and picnic spot (for non-thrillseekers). From June to September, you can also get your thrills white-water rafting – try River Run Rafting or Wilderness Tours Packages for organised trips on the Ottawa River. For a more vintage experience, don flying goggles with Ottawa Biplane Adventures, which offers open-cockpit city tours from its base at the Canadian Museum of Space and Aviation, itself a worthwhile aeronautical outing. Back in town you may round the day off with an After Dark Tour, a walking tour that recounts some seedy and grisly history before dropping you at the free Northern Lights show, a must-see nightly laser-light extravaganza at the parliament from early July to early September.Ottawa’s neighbourhoods bustle most on Saturdays. Breakfast on the Golden Triangle’s Elgin Street, visit the home of the city’s LGBT community on Bank Street, have lunch in Chinatown then head to the hipster frontier of Hintonburg to pick up repurposed souvenirs by local artists and craftspeople at Maker House, such as coat hooks made from an old ice hockey stick. It’s also from here that brewery tour operator Brew Donkey strikes out on fun five-hour weekend tours of local craft beer breweries in an old school bus.Sunday is farmers’ market day in Ottawa and the biggest option is the Ottawa Farmers’ Market in the Glebe, a blue-collar-gone-hip neighbourhood where old-school independent shops and restaurants thrive. Don’t miss Kettleman’s, a longstanding 24-hour place where you can watch and smell bagels being baked.

He questioned “why we’d bothered to raise it and why we even had an issue with it in the first place”, Lightoller said. Gillian Doherty, the founder of SEND (special education needs and disability) Action, which campaigns for children with special needs, said: “No child should be singled out and made to feel unwelcome at school. We’re hearing of many children with SEND experiencing mental health difficulties, developing anxiety about school attendance and being excluded from education.“It’s vital schools seek early specialist advice on how best to support children with special needs without undermining their self-esteem.”Funding for special needs education has been squeezed in recent years, with the sector engulfed in crisis. Council overspending on “high needs” education budgets trebled in the three years to 201718, with many cutting services or raiding other school budgets – which hits provision for children with special needs and disabilities in mainstream schools.Despite the list having being drawn up in November, the boy’s parents knew nothing until he brought the drawing back from school towards the end of term, two weeks ago. They fear it may have increased the bullying of their son, who had an at times fractious relationship with his classmates. “We’ve had a few more incidents of bullying this year than in the past, so it could have made things worse,” Lightoller said. “Early this year another student threw a bottle at my son’s head. That resulted in him needing to go to A\u0026ampE to have part of his eyelid glued.”During the year, the boy mentioned some of the children’s complaints as things he disliked about himself. “We had no idea, obviously, that he was getting reminders every day when he went to school about the things children dislike about him,” said Lightoller. “We had no idea where it was coming from – we just thought it was a child that was having a few issues.”As soon as they saw the picture, the parents had a meeting with the school’s behaviour mentor, who works with perpetrators and victims of bad behaviour, and with Fordham, who is credited with having turned around the school’s performance since taking over, and with whom they had had a good relationship. But the description of the session as “restorative justice” left them “furious, upset and hurt”, said Lightoller.Fordham did not respond to a request for comment. Transform Trust, which sponsors Allenton school, refused to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e80be27907852c24a459a7563a195d311552c1e/0_133_5598_3359/master/5598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ada2a2d5e223de639e9e877e4b5852c9","title":"international incident work mistake official secrets film","story":"It was the Observer’s big scoop of 2003, and as a young journalist, I was asked to type up a top-secret memo. Now my mess-up has made it to the big screenHave you ever wondered who’d play you in a film? I had, occasionally, until the day I got the answer. In spring 2018, a message pinged on to my phone via Facebook from a journalist friend. “So this is a bit weird,” it read. “A sister of a friend is playing you in a movie, apparently. You aware of this?” I wasn’t.“Hanako Footman is playing you in the film Official Secrets. She wants to meet you, like actors do. She saw we were pals and asked if I’d ask you. What did you do in that story?”“That story” concerns British whistleblower Katharine Gun, played by Keira Knightley in a film that premiered at Sundance festival in January. Fluent in Mandarin, the 28-year-old Gun was employed as a translator at GCHQ in Cheltenham. In 2003, she leaked a top-secret memo to the Observer about an illegal spying operation ordered by the US National Security Agency. It intended to bug the phones and emails of six United Nations delegates, from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea and Pakistan – nations that could determine whether the UN approved the invasion of Iraq.The memo, which outraged Gun, ordered staff to increase surveillance operations “particularly directed at… UN Security Council members (minus US and GBR, of course)” to provide real-time intelligence for Bush officials on voting intentions. I was working at the Observer at the time. And, although I was just a bit-player in the story, the film dramatises a monumental mess-up on my behalf – the biggest mistake of my career.It’s 2003. The airwaves are filled with Beyoncé’s Crazy In Love, Justin Timberlake’s Cry Me A River and Hey Ya! by OutKast. Cool young things wear absurdly small clothing – low-slung jeans nicknamed “bumsters”, for obvious reasons thongs crop tops and, most ill-advisedly, “shrugs”, unflattering miniature cardigans. An incredible heatwave sweeps Europe, too, with the mercury hitting 38.5C in Brogdale, Kent.The feverishness of those days extends to geopolitics. Three years earlier, George W Bush narrowly won the 2000 US presidential election after a recount in Florida and a debacle involving hanging chads. In 2001 came the terrorist attacks of 911, propelling al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden into the public consciousness. Britain’s “special relationship” with the US grew ever closer, thanks to the manoeuvrings of the then prime minister, Tony Blair.It was an interesting time for a young journalist with no newspaper experience to be joining the foreign desk of the Observer. Aged 24 and having held only junior positions at women’s magazines, I applied for the role of foreign desk assistant in late 2002. State-schooled in Sussex and with no newspaper contacts, I had a thirst for foreign news. As a teenager, my heroes had been foreign correspondents Kate Adie, Michael Buerk and John Simpson. At university I devoured the works of George Orwell – himself a former Observer journalist – Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn and Graham Greene, before devoting a year of my degree to the impact of reporting on the Vietnam war. What I offered in keenness must have made up for my lack of experience because, after two interviews, I took a call and was told: “You’ve got the job… if you want it?” Of course I did.Joining was a culture shock. Our working week ran from Tuesday to Saturday, with knocking-off times getting progressively later (9, 10, 11pm) as Sunday approached. Everyone was constantly available on their BlackBerry – the height of tech at the time. The neighbouring Coach \u0026amp Horses pub was our unofficial canteen. My colleagues were impressive: charismatic raconteurs, supremely well-read and worldly wise. I was entrusted with an A4 contacts book – a ringbinder of phone and satellite phone numbers and emails for correspondents all over the globe. Dusty reporters would fly in from assignments in far-flung places, handing over a bundle of disorganised receipts for obscure items: four camels, for instance, “replacements for a herd accidentally hit and killed on a road by driver”.It was intense, collegiate and fun, and I felt privileged to be part of the team – but also out of my depth. My brilliant predecessor had left to make documentaries for Channel 4. I set about looking after flak jackets and foreign currency, visas and travel plans. I called to check in with reporters on high-risk assignments and watched the international news wires for stories. Not long after I started, I was asked to look into flights for a foreign correspondent to go from London to Diyarbakir and then help find a fixer to assist with crossing a border. I didn’t even know which country that was, let alone which border they might be crossing.Towards the end of my second week, I was handed a printout of an email by Martin Bright (then the Observer’s home affairs editor, played in Official Secrets by Matt Smith) and Peter Beaumont (the foreign affairs editor – played by Matthew Goode). Could I type it up and save it into the system? I wasn’t given any other information. Their only instruction: “Don’t make any mistakes.” And so I set to painstakingly typing in each sentence.Importance HIGHTop SecretAllAs you’ve likely heard by now, the Agency is mounting a surge…… We’d appreciate your support in getting the word to your analysts who might have similar, more in-direct access to valuable information from accesses in your product lines.It took about 10 minutes. I double-checked it, sent it through, moved on to my next task.On Sunday morning, I woke up to see the paper’s front-page splash: “Revealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war”. Underneath was the memo I’d typed up.Of course, the story – broken by Bright, Beaumont and the inimitable New York correspondent and investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy (played with great aplomb and accuracy in the film by Rhys Ifans) – was huge. But my pride in being a tiny part of the team soon crumbled when, first thing on Monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unknown number and, as Monday was a day off for most of the news team, I didn’t expect it to be the office. It was – I think – Stephen Pritchard, the paper’s readers’ editor. He was very polite, but informed me with deft understatement and a total lack of drama that I had caused “something of an international incident”.Fastidiously typing in the memo, and not knowing what the document was or its origins, I’d changed all the American spelling “mistakes” to British English. “Recognize” became recognise, and “emphasize” emphasise. “Favorable” was amended to favourable. I thought I was being helpful. Instead, it was a disaster.The story that Gun had risked so much to reveal was thrown into doubt. How could this be a leaked US memo, asked websites such as the Drudge Report, when it was all spelled in British English? The wobble caught on. Was it a fake? Some outlets due to report on the Observer’s story cancelled interviews over doubts about the memo’s authenticity. It was decided the readers’ editor should publish a special dispatch to counter the thousands of complaints from readers, many American, calling us “lying limey bastards”, claiming that the story’s authors had fallen victim to a hoax and that the email was part of a campaign of misinformation.Of course, it was not. Despite my “administrative error”, the story still made shockwaves around the world. Some days later, Gun went on to reveal her identity, and her life imploded she lost her job, was arrested and ultimately faced a trial under the Official Secrets Act, which collapsed after the prosecution declined to offer its evidence.Meanwhile, I struggled to make peace with the ramifications of what I’d done. Humiliated, and just a few weeks into my dream job, I rang my former magazine editor and asked for my old job back it had, of course, been filled.By Tuesday morning, there was nothing to do but go in and face the music. I assumed I’d be fired, and sobbed in the office loo before going to my desk. But while I am sure everyone involved was cursing my name – one of the biggest stories of their careers had been plunged into unnecessary doubt – they were outwardly kind and magnanimous. I was summoned to meet Pritchard and Bright to explain what had happened, and while there were a few eye rolls I think they understood why I’d done what I did, being in the dark about the genesis of the document. How the mistake wasn’t spotted by anyone else was also a matter of some consternation.Somehow, I managed to put the disaster behind me. The senior editors forgave me, and I remained on the foreign desk for three years.When, 16 years later, I found out that not only was the story being made into a film, but my mistake had been included, I had some sleepless nights. I met Footman, the young actor who plays me, at a cafe in London early last year with some trepidation. She told me she couldn’t ulge any specifics about the movie. “But is it made clear I wasn’t fired over what happened?” I asked. She was noncommittal, but said I did appear in a later scene. She wanted to talk details: what did I wear back in the day? What colour did I paint my fingernails? How did I get on with my colleagues? What were the foreign correspondents like? “Most of my outfits were probably too casual,” I said. “I was frequently hungover and more than once fell asleep in the canteen.” And how to describe the foreign correspondents? Simultaneously impressive and unpredictable.Around nine months after we met, I was invited to a first-cut screening of the film. I watched as “Nicole” got bawled out by the Observer’s famously sweary then editor, Roger Alton (played by Conleth Hill, Lord Varys in Game Of Thrones) in front of the entire team – thankfully not something that happened in real life. Footman played a blinder as me – albeit a more groomed version.I knew it would be hard to watch my mistake unfold, but when it came, it felt like being punched in the throat. I felt the shame all over again, and sobbed silently into my tissue. Nevertheless, the film is as brilliant as it is important. And while I wouldn’t recommend carrying the burden of a catastrophic fuck-up, as Alton would term it, through one’s career, it did provide a salutary lesson in attention to detail. It was my first serious mistake, and hopefully it will be my last.• Official Secrets is released in the UK on 18 OctoberIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfd9ba489f87064d99d831bcca3947fb99bdfcae/0_229_4285_2571/master/4285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e9ce9609228ed7fdbcd06635cea488f","title":"gareth bale move china blocked by real madrid board","story":"Gareth Bale looks set to remain at Real Madrid, a club that does not want him, after the board blocked his lucrative transfer to China.The Wales winger had been expected to join the Chinese Super League side Jiangsu Suning on a three-year deal.

But is ‘low-T’ really to blame for making men ‘soft’ – or is the politicisation of the hormone more sinister? Sam Wolfson reportsFlorida was on a knife-edge during the 2016 US presidential election. Almost every poll had it too close to call. In the final few weeks before the vote, a rash of ads appeared on radio and TV claiming that Hillary Clinton was too frail, too liberal and too ethically compromised to become president.Dr Dareld Morris, the owner of a small medical clinic in Florida, recorded and paid for his own anti-Clinton ad. Unlike the others, he suggested a vote for the Democratic candidate wasn’t merely the wrong political choice, but the result of a chemical imbalance. “Hi guys, Doc Morris here,” it began in a chirpy, mattress-salesman tone. “Most are not aware of the negative effects low-T can have on your mental state, for instance, your ability to focus and think clearly… So, as a community service, I have this special offer: for any guys out there that are thinking of voting for Hillary, I want to offer you a free testosterone test. Just come in and register in my office in Fort Myers and let’s see if we can help.”Not many people took Morris’s ad too seriously most news outlets were pleased for a frothy story in an election that was short on light relief. Even Morris himself back-pedalled slightly, telling local news that the ad was just an “experiment”, although he added: “I’m actually voting for Donald Trump, so I think it’s even more funnier.”Yet in the years since, it has become a strange kind of orthodoxy among American conservatives that being a liberally minded man who supports feminism is simply a result of having abnormally low levels of testosterone. Like much of conspiracy conservatism, it began on message boards where various alt-right activists gather. There, being “low-T” has become the ultimate insult, alongside other masculinity-challenging burns such as “cuck”, “soyboy” and “beta”. On Reddit’s biggest Trump community, The Donald, there are thousands of posts that say things like “POST-VEGAS CUCKOLDRY: Low-T Leftist Decides to Virtue Signal by Turning in His Guns.” There’s also a “low-T beta male starter pack” that includes pictures of Bernie Sanders and desert boots.But it’s an idea that’s spread quickly to the political mainstream. When then-attorney general Jeff Sessions suddenly became more active in trying to prosecute White House leakers, Republican congressman Matt Gaetz suggested he’d started “taking those supplements for low-T”.During the campaign, Trump’s own testosterone levels were revealed during a special episode of the talkshow Dr Oz, certainly a presidential first. The audience whooped and cheered as Oz confirmed that Trump’s T-score of 441 was “good”.Politicians have long believed that demonstrating physical strength projects strength as a leader. But the obsession with testosterone is about more than being able to win in a fight. Testosterone is an often-misunderstood hormone, present in both men and women. It plays an important role in sexual function and having a lot of it can help you build muscle, but it also helps with cognition, energy and mood. People with low testosterone are more likely to have multiple chronic health conditions (although researchers argue that a causal link has not been proven). So saying someone has low testosterone taps into a murky mix of insecurities: about not being manly, lacking assertiveness and being unable to satisfy sexually.In reality, levels of testosterone are far more complex to understand. Only a small percentage of total testosterone molecules are “free” to be used by the body, and levels change constantly depending on your mood, time of day and other environmental factors. Nor is it true that testosterone makes you more athletic – this issue has come to a head in the case of Caster Semenya. But the IAAF’s own analysis of 1,100 female runners found that in three of the 11 running events, women with lower testosterone performed better than those with higher levels.The truth is that most men experience a decline in testosterone levels from around the age of 30 and, until recently, most people thought of having low testosterone as part of a kind of “male menopause”, an issue for older men with waning libidos. But this new, politicised, understanding of testosterone isn’t just about ageing. It’s succinctly explained in a video entitled The Truth About Soy Boys made by Paul Joseph Watson, a member of Ukip and one of the shining lights of Britain’s alt-right community.Watson demonstrates that many of the politically correct left-wingers he despises are also committed vegans and argues that because foods like soya milk and tofu contain oestrogen, and oestrogen lowers testosterone, they are making vegans more feminine and therefore more liberal – or as he puts it: “Buzzfeed-watching, tofu-eating, male-feminist virtue-signalling, beta-orbiter soy boys.”In other words, men as a group are becoming softer and there’s science to prove it. To reverse the trend, we just need to boost our testosterone. What could be better grist for the mill for those trying to make America great again or take back control?Big pharma has been quick to offer miracle cures to this apparent ill. I first came across this strange linking between Trumpish rhetoric and hormone treatments watching TV adverts in America. One, for a product called Ageless Male, asks: “When did it become OK for men to become softer, lazier, weaker?” The same brand offers a free month’s trial if you text the promo code “wimp” to its hotline.Since those adverts began, there’s been an increase in the number of men seeking to boost their testosterone levels. In the US, more than 1 million men have been getting new tests for testosterone levels and more than 283,000 initiated testosterone treatment in a four-year period.That impact is being felt in the UK, too. High-street pharmacies, as well as online start-ups, are now offering testosterone testing, letting men do at-home blood tests to help satiate or stoke their fears.Stricter controls on television advertising in the UK mean that pro-testosterone thinking is being stoked in books and online. The charge is led by Daniel Kelly, a fitness coach from Stoke-on-Trent who has written his own book advocating testosterone-replacement therapy (TRT) for young people. It’s called Optimized Under 35: How to Boost Your Testosterone, Increase Your Sex Drive and Achieve Incredible Health.Kelly’s book is typical of the way testosterone devotees like to blend their version of science with a conservative worldview. In the introduction he talks about how testosterone use helped him with his anxiety and libido, and promises that the book will advise any reader how to reap the same benefits. Much of the book includes highly technical hormone advice and references to scientific studies.But the science is blended with sentiments more familiar to late-night listeners of LBC. “The movement to empower women has swung the pendulum too far,” he writes. “Young men are brainwashed with anti-male vitriol…” and so on.Kelly sees this not just as a crisis of masculinity, but a crisis of testosterone indeed he says the two are “inseparable”. In one passage he writes: “This low-T reality has infested many areas of society to the point that it’s unacceptable to bring up traditional or conservative views in polite conversation… make no mistake, it’s not ‘toxic masculinity’ that’s the problem, it’s the toxic progressive ideology that hates anything masculine that poses a real problem to society.”It would be easy to dismiss this as meninist nonsense, yet a part of me also thinks I would feel quietly emasculated if I were to discover I had low-T. It makes me think of the way false versions of femininity have long been measured in expensive grooming regimes and unrealistic body types. Even politically aware feminists can still feel inadequate staring at a size-zero model. Those are pressures that men have found it easier to avoid. Yet now, here we are creating our own field in which to feel deficient and unmanly – one which is completely invisible.To find out where I stand, I order a £50 T-testing kit from Superdrug. Soon there are Sweeney Todd-like scenes at my kitchen table as I try to produce enough blood from a series of pinpricks to fill a vial. “Babes, you’ve got to milk your finger!” shouts my girlfriend as she tries to scoop blood into the plastic tube. I’ve always been told my bald head, monstrous body hair and speedy facial hair growth are classic signs of high testosterone. I send off the sample relatively confident I don’t have any of the symptoms associated with low-T.While I wait for the results, I try to find out if there’s any actual scientific proof behind the fears that we’re not getting enough testosterone. I speak to Rebecca M Jordan-Young, a sociomedical scientist at Barnard College, Columbia University, and co-author of the forthcoming book, Testosterone: an Unauthorised Biography. I am not surprised when she tells me that much of the received wisdom about testosterone is nonsense.“The idea of low-T has been really pushed, but low-T in and of itself is not a problem – you can have pretty low-T and be getting an awful lot out of that,” she says. “The average man has so much more testosterone than is needed for sexual functioning. In placebo-controlled, randomised trials, when they start with healthy people who have no complaints… most trials find no difference in any aspect of mood or cognition or behaviour even at massively high levels of testosterone.”Jordan-Young says that hormones are extremely complex. The idea that ingesting more oestrogen from soy means you have less testosterone is a complete misunderstanding of how hormones work. Indeed, testosterone is often converted into oestrogen, which means that people who routinely inject testosterone often end up growing breasts.Other research has shown that some testosterone treatments, especially those self-administered without regular medical checks, may make men more prone to heart attacks and prostate cancer. Boosting testosterone can also make a man infertile. Jordan-Young says the reason for much of this confusion comes from the misconception that testosterone is “the male sex hormone”.“Hormones were originally discovered within a research programme that was already set up to characterise them as about masculinity and femininity. It was originally thought that when they did find the ‘male essence’ it would only be found in male bodies, that it would be detrimental to female bodies and that it would be exclusively about sex-related functions. None of those things turned out to be true, but all of them lived on in our folklore.”Jordan-Young says there is little solid evidence of a testosterone decline in men. Even the claim that men have less testosterone now than they did a generation ago is doubtful. Studies are conflicting: some say there’s no decline at all a couple say there’s a small but statistically significant decline over time. But the best population-based data from the US doesn’t show any decline in men.Yet in this strange world in which endocrinology has overlapped with gender politics, the myth has spread faster than any scientific approach. Many healthy men believe they need more testosterone, not least because there are some men for whom TRT can be life-changing.Some of them are treated by Dr Richard Petty, who runs the Wellman Clinic. Petty is a fantastically posh doctor who calls his secretaries “the girls” and has an office on Harley Street as big as my flat. He began specialising in men’s health after running a private clinic in the 1970s in Chelsea. When the recession and the three-day week hit, his patients could no longer afford to live in the area – as he puts it: “They had to live in their country houses or move to Putney” – so the wives and children got new doctors in the suburbs and he kept “the chaps”.He began dealing more with prostate cancer, learning about testosterone and publishing on its importance. He’s rather more bullish than Jordan-Young about the prospects of TRT for transforming lives.I ask whether he can tell when someone comes through the door whether they have low testosterone. “Absolutely, I can see from the street. You get anaemic, you see. So they’re pale. Even if they’re brown they’re not pink. Arteries in the face are less dilated than they would be otherwise.”Petty says for a number of the patients he sees, TRT can not only perk up their sex life but lead to major improvements in mental health, lifting a depression that they have previously been unable to treat effectively.Armed with a new understanding of how testosterone works, I give Daniel Kelly a ring, hoping to convince him that men under 35 don’t need to get involved with testosterone boosting. He’s jollier than I expected, although occasionally says things like: “Society is trying to pigeonhole men almost into behaving like women.”He explains that he now injects testosterone directly twice a week and plans to do so for the rest of his life. He did have quite low testosterone levels to begin with, but says he’s not concerned simply about remedying low testosterone, but having an optimum level.I explain what Jordan-Young has said, that optimum testosterone isn’t real and your body can do a lot with a little T, and Kelly groans. “Mainstream doctors think it’s fine, as long as the hormones are in an arbitrary range made up by someone in an ivory tower who doesn’t understand it. It’s an arbitrary reference range that they made up. There’s a big difference between normal health and optimal health. It’s going to take some balancing, but what’s the alternative: feel like crap because you’re in some arbitrary reference range?”He quotes studies at me that refute the link between testosterone and prostate cancer. He says over-the-counter hormone boosters can be dangerous, but he only advocates prescription TRT that “shrinks your balls” and gives you acne, and otherwise he believes “there are no risks”.He accepts that some people don’t need TRT and it should be a last resort after changes to diet, getting fit and giving up booze. Yet he still believes many men – not just men with severe symptoms, or men who doctors believe have dangerously low-T – would be happier if they increased their T-levels artificially, even though it means they’ll have to do so for the rest of their lives. “Low testosterone makes men more meek and lacking in confidence, and the honest truth is if you walk down the street most men won’t even give you a strong handshake.”As so often happens when science and politics collide, there are some slivers of truth hidden beneath a lot of nonsense. Testosterone can be transformative for those lacking it. But the idea that any kind of crisis of masculinity has been caused by lower testosterone in the population is a fiction, wished into existence by those peddling right-wing pseudoscience.Or so I had convinced myself, right up until my T results land in my inbox. I’m shocked. I’m in the one-star petrol category, with a score my “Superdrug doctor” describes as “within the normal range, but at the lower end”. Despite not experiencing any of the associated problems with low testosterone, I honestly feel ashamed of my T-score. My logical brain might know I shouldn’t be worried, but I find myself flicking back through Kelly’s book, looking for advice. Maybe I do struggle to concentrate. Who doesn’t feel a bit lethargic sometimes? If testosterone insecurity has been manufactured out of nowhere over the past decade, it’s certainly working on me. Superdrug says I should do a second test to make sure of the result. I immediately start Googling to find a company that will give me a second opinion – and hopefully a better result."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2a9518c36b0e675214e0112082d7f75ba55d07f/0_223_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=419af89e1be778f06b2cdd2f6ddc5690","title":"a controlling woman in our lives is turning my girlfriend against me","story":"The best way to react is to do absolutely nothing, says Mariella FrostrupThe dilemma My girlfriend and I have been together for four years.

She puts pressure on her to catch up many times a week. I’m trying to be supportive, but my girlfriend defends her and is sceptical of her coming on to me, saying I miss the attention. It feels as if she’s been reeled in and can’t see her behaviour is causing an issue. I’m starting to feel like a ranting boyfriend, which is making it worse.Mariella replies Understandable. The annoying thing about partners is that all too often they completely disregard our opinions about friends and family. You’d think that sharing someone’s bed and life would put you in pole position to dictate, or at least influence, their choices, but when push comes to shove, all they plough is their own flawed furrow. I can feel your pain, but unfortunately there’s little I can do to assuage it.This woman sounds like the sort of person fiction is inspired by – writers like Iris Murdoch would have a field day with her untrammelled determination to take what she wants and leave broken hearts and abandoned suitors in her wake. She’s certainly managed to get you hot under the collar and it does raise the question, did she once have you too under her spell? As you describe her she certainly lacks any appealing qualities.That said, controlling our lovers is not an option, so when they choose to take a different path our choices are limited, and often we can only stand by and wait to say: “I told you so.” I don’t know this woman so I can’t judge her simply on what you say, although I’ve met many who mirror the elements that you describe. No doubt she’s a consummate seducer and the more you battle against her influence, the harder she’ll try to compete with you.In such circumstances, unless you have weapons of mass destruction at your disposal, or are prepared to invest the time to embark on all-out psychological warfare, the best way to react is to do absolutely nothing. Feigning lack of interest is your most powerful tool and will stop you squandering vast amounts of time on situations in which you are likely to have little impact. You’ve spent four years with this partner of yours so if she’s still inclined to disregard your misgivings, you have little choice but to leave her to it.Sometimes it’s worth considering the worst case scenario because once we have that in our minds, there’s little power left to those who are causing us upset. In this instance either you imagine your girlfriend is going to be seduced, has already been seduced or may in some other way be influenced against you. Your girlfriend’s mental health issues may make her easy prey, but they also shouldn’t be used by you as ammunition against her ability to choose her friendships. The two matters are entirely separate.If you consider your girlfriend to be so susceptible to the influence of others that it’s cause for worry, encouraging her to visit a therapist and resolve those vulnerabilities would be more supportive behaviour than railing against her feelings for a particular pal. Much of what this woman gets up to is entirely within the bounds of acceptable behaviour and pejorative terms like “reeling in” only serve to make you seem predisposed against her for enjoying a vibrant and varied sex life.That doesn’t mean I’m not sympathetic to your feelings, but you’ve written to me because I’m also entirely emotionally removed from the situation, which naturally affects my view. I’d say this woman has struck you where you are most vulnerable and is managing to play on your insecurities by maintaining her close proximity to your girlfriend. The only way to change any relationship dynamic, whether friendship, romantic, business or family, is not to try to alter others but modify or attempt different behaviour yourself.If I were in your shoes, I’d be looking for an active form of displacement activity, with friends whose company you enjoy that would not only keep you distracted but might actually entirely obscure this woman’s presence in your sphere. If you can’t change her, or your girlfriend’s commitment to her, you can certainly change your own response to that dynamic. Expending energy trying to exert control over situations that we have little chance of achieving success in is not a sensible or productive use of our short tenure in this world. Let go and you may be surprised how quickly she boomerangs back. If she doesn’t, perhaps you have less in common than you previously imagined."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8fa861e577d1597bfd5be6d3c7241a256c0d809/1204_935_4488_2693/master/4488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=533f4ad7c5535bbe243326abe3966fad","title":"five ways to have a stress free morning","story":"Do what you can the night before, avoid gadgets – and don’t hit the snooze buttonPrepare what you can the night before, says Dr Hazel Wallace, a locum doctor and the author of The Food Medic – from your packed lunch to laying out your clothes. Vicky Silverthorn, a professional organiser, suggests leaving necessary items by the front door, or using sticky notes as reminders. Checking the weather forecast, keeping your calendar up to date and taking care of any time-intensive grooming routines the night before will also help you feel more prepared.Dr Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley, advises against hitting the snooze button, as it disrupts uninterrupted, quality sleep instead he suggests setting your alarm for when you actually need to wake up. The Sleep Council, which promotes healthy sleep habits, warns that your body experiences a spike in cortisol every time your alarm goes off. If you struggle not to press the button, leave the alarm across the room, so you have to walk over to silence it. You could also try one that eases you awake with light or vibrations.Silverthorn advocates getting into a routine of placing your keys and other essential items in the same place each time you get in, be it on a hook or in a tray or a drawer: “Have a home for everything.” Decluttering your home can also lead to a more streamlined routine. “The less you have, the easier it is to be in charge of your home, rather than it being in charge of you.”Wallace makes overnight oats most evenings and takes them with her to work the next day. Silverthorn says it is useful to have systems in place, such as checklists or a tea and coffee station in the kitchen, but she warns against anything complicated, as it has less chance of sticking long-term. If your children are old enough to make their own breakfast, leave bowls and food within their reach, to encourage independence. “The kitchen is the hub of the home. If that’s in the right place, as it were, then everything runs more smoothly,” she says.Many of us make the mistake of reaching for our phones first thing. Instead, Silverthorn encourages starting the day with at least five minutes away from gadgets, perhaps spent making a cup of tea and sitting down to drink it in peace. “That is vital for me every morning. It’s five minutes to get your head together. You can say it’s hard, but five minutes is doable.” The daily commute can also be made less stressful with a few tweaks, says Wallace. Check for delays, leave in plenty of time, wear comfortable shoes and have a book or a podcast ready for your journey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bec279d175e63b01d471a9ffdd57c8a156927f04/49_0_2383_1430/master/2383.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fa525c5a1d49c2e2c2787afb611a19d","title":"san francisco runner artwork frida strava","story":"Lenny Maughan has been turning his routes into art, choosing paths that when viewed on a map form illustrations Crafting a running route is a delicate process, especially in a city like San Francisco: you’ve got to find somewhere safe and scenic, avoid the crowds and decide how many hills you want to conquer. One runner in the city, however, is making things even more complicated – with beautiful results.For the past four years, Lenny Maughan has been turning his routes into art. His paths through the city are carefully chosen so that, viewed on a map, they form illustrations of everything from a simple heart shape to the starship Enterprise. So far he’s made 53 works – including, most recently, an unmistakable image of the artist Frida Kahlo that made a splash on Reddit and in local media.Maughan didn’t set out to be a running artist. But as route-tracking apps became popular, runners began to notice images in their pathways, “kind of like a Rorschach test”, he told the . The immediate impulse among many runners was, inevitably, to draw penises: “That’s where it all began,” he said. “But I wanted to do something different and something original.”Indeed, creating Frida Kahlo required a 28.9-mile run. Maughan tracks his paths using the running app Strava, which means you, too, can run in the shape of the celebrated Mexican artist’s face. If you’re as fit as Maughan, it will take you six hours and eight minutes.The tracking process is high-tech, but the whole thing starts with just a pen and paper. “When I was a kid everyone thought I’d be an artist when I grew up – I was always drawing things,” he said. He was a particular fan of the Etch-a-Sketch, which has something in common with his current work: both require creating images in an unbroken line.Maughan has lived in San Francisco for more than 20 years, and many of his images happen to have a connection to the region. He has run in the shape of California the Grateful Dead guitarist’s Jerry Garcia’s hand, missing part of the middle finger and a firefighter’s helmet and axe, to honor first responders amid wildfires.But such local links are just coincidental, he said. His goal is to create images anyone can recognize: “This is just a way to make the streets my own.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e0ac09d7d3d16b66d61340720ae4a3f7248b08/0_142_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13aea4f18cfdd5d69d54fe1cfec41289","title":"jumping jack cash how young mick jagger planned pension rolling stones","story":"The young Rolling Stone had more sympathy for his bus pass than the devil, says his former accountantTo his fans, he was a young man focused on sex, drugs and rock’n’roll. But in his mid-20s Mick Jagger had other, rather more sedate, things on his mind, it has been claimed: a pension plan for his retirement.The Rolling Stones star turned 76 last week and appears to have no plans to hang up his microphone. But when he was young he found the idea that he would still be performing after the age of 60 preposterous, and was keen to prepare his finances for his twilight years, according to the man who was his accountant at the time.Myers recalled that Jagger, who studied at the London School of Economics, had also considered a career in insurance. He was “very bright, and very interested in business” said Myers. “The Rolling Stones became our client for years and, for eight months, had their offices in my offices, which was a very exciting time,” he added.Jagger, who performed on stage last month for the first time since undergoing heart surgery this year, now has an estimated fortune of £260m.The Stones will be among stars appearing in a memoir that Myers, now 82, has just finished. Out in October and titled Hunky Dory (Who Knew?), it will offer an insider’s view of the music industry’s golden age, focusing on the 1960s and 1970s. Myers signed the little-known David Bowie when no one else was interested and worked alongside the renowned record producer Mickie Most with the Animals, Donovan, Jeff Beck and Lulu. He masterminded deals, stopped record publishers exploiting songwriters, sorted contracts, and managed the New Seekers and the Tremeloes, among others.He also recalled signing Bowie and becoming his early manager when the future star was struggling: “Nobody wanted to sign him.”He described him as a quiet man: “You would have thought he was an insurance clerk. You would not have thought he was a rock star. It was just when he went on stage.”Myers saw his potential, investing his own money in a Bowie promo disc that led to an RCA deal and albums such as Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust: “We pressed 500 copies of the Bowie promo. One sold recently for $10,000. I threw them away. Who knew?”Angie Bowie, the star’s first wife, has endorsed the book, saying: “Laurence took a big chance on David when the record business was not interested in him. David was always grateful.”When Rod Stewart was still up and coming, he would hang around Myers’s office every Friday, waiting to be paid for his latest gig with Jeff Beck.“But we were an accountancy office and my partner said, ‘I’ve got this shoe manufacturer coming up, who’s that guy lying around the office?’ I went out and said to Rod, ‘I’m very sorry, but you can’t come here any more. Phone me and I’ll tell you when I’ve got your money ready.’ I threw him out of the office.”He added that everybody knew Stewart was going to be something special, and they were charmed by him, including the receptionist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bd056216a7ecaaa28b67c1291e39e19bdf99d20/542_226_1111_666/master/1111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48179760e4594cda8c6d0dd18dd3786f","title":"prom 12 nyo nicola benedetti wigglesworth review glowing strings and a touch of marsalis","story":"Royal Albert Hall, LondonMeticulous preparation was evident in this powerful performance from the National Youth Orchestra with violinist Nicola BenedettiIt’s no disrespect to our professional orchestras to say it makes a difference when everyone on stage for a concert thinks it’s a really big deal. That’s what you get every year with the National Youth Orchestra Prom.This year it opened with superhero music: the London premiere of Icarus, by Lera Auerbach. Purposeful, dark and intense, and ultimately rather two-dimensional, it often wouldn’t seem out of place in a Marvel movie. Frenzied, close-circling strings in the first movement give way to a solemn dance in the second, with high solo strings above grumbling brass, all dying away into one pure tone as a percussionist rubs the rim of a wine glass. The NYO players, conducted by Mark Wigglesworth, threw themselves at it. They did the same for Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto, and there were some memorable moments: the glow of the first big string tune the burst of energy as the finale erupted on to the scene. Soloist Nicola Benedetti had been working with the orchestra during their week-long course and the rapport showed. For herself, Benedetti shaped a secure and expansive performance, giving a real kick to the dance sections of the finale. Her encore, from the Fiddle Dance Suite written for her by Wynton Marsalis, kept on swinging as she walked slowly offstage.Speaking before her encore, Benedetti had paid tribute to the orchestra, making the principal wind players blush. They deserved it: there were parts of Prokofiev’s ballet music for Romeo and Juliet – given in Wigglesworth’s own selection – that I haven’t heard played better. Wigglesworth didn’t wallow in the slow music, nor did he have to whip his players along in the fight scenes the fact that he seemed to need to do so little spoke of meticulous rehearsal.Their encore was Bernstein’s Mambo from West Side Story – the calling card of another Proms favourite youth ensemble, the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra. Slickly played with a British rather than a Latin style of abandon, it had a bit of freestyling nonetheless. At the end, even the cellists were on their feet. Why should the Bolívars have all the fun?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d3c528153951de39cbc827264e3f4023eee0668/75_178_1481_889/master/1481.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a60c97ed61f4bd60ad917e29e7519168","title":"proms at battersea arts centre review cevanne horrocks new music","story":"Battersea Arts Centre, LondonThis teasing, challenging new-music bill was a mashup of genres, noises and hi-tech tools that rejoiced in sonic breadthIt opened with a vocal tour de force from Jennifer Walshe: snatches of pop hits poured unaccompanied from her lips, lyrics spliced like an anarchic mashup of Top of the Pops 2 footage. And it ended with Oliver Coates brandishing his cello aloft, its tone distorting with each movement – part helicopter, part electric guitar – as layers of synthesised sound roared around him. They dissipated gradually, leaving a single sustained note and ears ringing.This latest Proms outing beyond South Kensington didn’t just step away from the cavernous Royal Albert Hall into the intimate, artfully lit and stripped-wall surroundings of the BAC. Performed across three small stages surrounding its standing audience, this mixed programme of new music crossed other boundaries: between music and noise, genres and styles, human performers and hi-tech tools.In Crewdson and Cevanne’s set, Cevanne Horrocks-Hopayian’s “sonic bonnet” (a Midi controller worn as a spectacular headdress) triggered looping, distant seagulls, running water and crackles of static, which mingled deliciously with her live harp and sunset-warm, folk-inspired vocals. Also exploring that human-tech ide, Neil Luck used the Musarc choral collective in Any’s Responses as a live laugh-track, their ultra-tight responses triggered by musical instructions spoken deadpan. Elsewhere, his gnomic Deepy Kaye mixed blink-and-you’ll-miss-it video clips of card dealing and coins spinning with his own vocals (spoken, garbled or gargled through water), mystifying live audio description from Mary Ann Hushlak and live electronics with viola (James McIlwrath) and cello (Rebecca Burden).But it wasn’t all about digital wizardry. Kit Downes’s improvisation on BAC’s 1901 pipe organ – on which restoration work after a fire in 2015 “isn’t quite finished”, as he explained with relish – was a keen-eared celebration of the instrument’s foibles. Under Downes’s hands and feet, its unearthly whistles, patches of microtonal tuning and percussive, pitchless expulsions of air through faulty pipes became beguiling extensions of the standard array of keys and stops. And in a concert that by turn challenged, teased and rejoiced in the sheer breadth of sonic possibilities available to producers of new music today, it was a salient reminder of the continued pleasures and potential of analogue sound."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27b16cb42f97a8ba02592c892f8863e5e0eb3d96/0_0_3678_2207/master/3678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b301b85b34342491089ddd3cb6dcf9d","title":"sleater kinney the center wont hold interview","story":"The feminist punks’ new album, produced by St Vincent and inspired in part by a Rihanna song, is their most expansive yet. So why did their drummer just quit the band?By now, we know reunion culture is a con. The brief excitement of seeing a favourite band re-form is swiftly tempered by watching them resentfully trot out the hits and confront their mortality. Plus, the past is no longer a novelty but our perpetual groundhog day of recycled franchises and rebooted brands.Which is why Sleater-Kinney’s surprise return, in 2015, nine years after they went on hiatus, was so refreshing. Not content to rehash old glories, the feminist punks had a brilliant new album, the riotous, new wavy No Cities to Love, and singer-guitarists Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker and drummer Janet Weiss were unabashedly vocal about ending the dearth of fortysomething women in rock.Even better, it turned out not to be a one-off. This January, news that St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, had produced their new album “broke the internet”, said US indie bible Pitchfork, sounding slightly awed by the “endless possibilities of what this collaboration might sound like”. “Endless possibilities” was on the money: The Center Won’t Hold is Sleater-Kinney’s most erse album, bursting with vaudevillian romps about how women are naturals at handling chaos, industrial demands for carnal and spiritual satisfaction, Tom Petty-indebted balladry couching admissions of betrayal and rousing choruses made to yell at last orders.In mid-June, I am due to meet the trio to discuss their second second coming over lunch in Portland, Oregon, but I get an email hours beforehand saying Weiss is ill. Tucker arrives at the neighbourhood spot first, her striped earrings matching her monochrome T-shirt. It’s a shame about Weiss, I say. “Yeah,” Tucker says with a sigh, looking at the sky. “It is.” Brownstein appears, tiny and shaggily glam in a grey felted jacket. We head into the restaurant, which is straight out of Portlandia, the now concluded Emmy-winning satire of life in the zealously artisanal city that Brownstein wrote and starred in. She orders fish stew, while Tucker orders cornbread and asks the waiter what their “zero food print” certification means. It’s a programme funding climate-friendly farming, we learn, as Michael Jackson plays over the stereo.They laugh at the ethical absurdity. Tucker and Brownstein are Sleater-Kinney’s songwriters and their 25-year friendship is seductive. They’re as goofy as they are deferential, less serious than you might imagine – Brownstein’s grin occupies half her face and Tucker frequently detonates an explosive laugh. This new album is a bit of a fluke, they explain. Last spring, Brownstein was developing an adaptation of her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl for TV, a potential post-Portlandia project. The lightly fictionalised show would trace her and Tucker’s search for a drummer in Olympia, Washington, where they met as students who moved to the city to join the early 90s riot grrrl scene.Back then, in real life, the pair flew to Melbourne to meet their first drummer without hearing a beat of her playing. They made two albums with Laura Macfarlane, until the geographical logistics became annoying. Then they found Weiss, who was “the best decision we ever made”, Brownstein wrote in her memoir. Weiss joined for their third (and first great) album, 1997’s poppy, punchy Dig Me Out. They eclipsed the DIY Olympia scene and became one of America’s most innovative rock bands, subverting girl-group convention and classic rock excess, while Tucker’s astonishing gospel wail gave their work a powerful spiritual urgency. Once fans found out that Tucker and Brownstein had briefly dated, they became queer icons of a sort, too.Brownstein’s pilot for the show about their early days wasn’t picked up. But if it had succeeded, she says, who knows when they would have had time to make a new album. “I was like, why am I examining music through a historical lens? My relationship to music is right now. That’s more important to me.”That relationship was reinvigorated when they saw young people who missed them first time at their incendiary reunion shows. I went to five of those to make up for lost time aged 16, I’d bought their single Jumpers on sight. It was on green vinyl and the credits billed three women, which was enough of a USP in the laddy 00s. I was too late – it turned out to be their last single.Brownstein recently started to think the bar around their 2015 comeback was too low. “There’s this leeway: oh, it’s not terrible! And it was nothing even close to terrible, but you can sail on the momentum of relieved enthusiasm for a while.” Deciding to continue raises the stakes: the only point, says Tucker, is to do something different. “Wanting to play with what we’ve done before, wanting to take risks.”Taking risks can prove, well, risky. Nine days after I meet Tucker and Brownstein, Weiss quits Sleater-Kinney. “The band is heading in a new direction and it is time for me to move on,” she says in a statement. I track her down and ask if she wants to talk she considers it, but declines.Tucker and Brownstein sound crushed when we speak the day after Weiss’s news. They admit that she wasn’t unwell the day we met in Portland – this happened very recently and suddenly and they didn’t know what was going on. They tried band therapy. They won’t speculate on Weiss’s reasoning, although Brownstein says they thought “everyone was really happy about the record”.But the show will go on. Brownstein says they are as determined to evolve as ever. “After these years, it might feel harder to take those risks, but that’s what I’m invested in. Corin and I took ourselves to the opposite side of the world to start Sleater-Kinney. There’s always been something impulsive and scrappy about this band and I don’t feel there’s another way to be in it except to adapt and evolve.”Appropriately, The Center Won’t Hold takes inspiration from an unlikely source – at least for a punk band. They were driving around listening to Rihanna’s ballad Stay when Brownstein said she wanted to write a song like it. When they started writing in earnest, she was living in Los Angeles, Tucker in Portland (Brownstein later moved back), so they had to work remotely for the first time, giving them space to expand their inidual visions.Brownstein apologetically ventures a “super-psychoanalytical” theory. Tucker became a parent before Sleater-Kinney made 2002’s One Beat, one of the period’s few explicitly anti-Bush albums – Far Away depicted her breastfeeding while watching televised warfare. “Remember your awareness of being a mother and having to be protective of your kids?” Brownstein asks. “Your son is 18, he’s going to college. Not like, ‘You’re done!’, but it seems like you feel so much more freedom to express anxieties. That’s maybe harder when you’re holding so tight to notions of family.”Tucker agrees. She had worried that being a musician would mess up her kids – her second was born after the band’s 2006 break – but with one kid out the door, she feels relief. “It is really freeing to rage a bit more in my songs.”Not that she’s been sanguine in the interim – she raged loudly on the last album. Also, what about her 11-year-old daughter? “She’s raising herself,” Brownstein deadpans. Their relationships have registered the change. Now 46, Tucker says she used to be the care-giver while Brownstein, 44, was needier. (Brownstein describes Weiss, 53, as consistently “no-nonsense”.)“Carrie has really worked on being a very nurturing person,” says Tucker, with comedy largesse. “She’s very caring.”Tucker says she has become less nice, although she still insists on sharing her lunch. “I’ve raised two kids, done that, and now I’m more in touch with what I need, what I deserve.”That need rages through Broken, the bluesy piano ballad that took the Rihanna inspiration somewhere very different. It’s a tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged that supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her in 1982. “She stood up for us when she testified me, me too,” Tucker sings, ruefully: “My body cried out when she spoke those lines.”Kavanaugh was appointed anyway. But one outcome, says Tucker, was positive. “To say ‘me too’ means this matters, that you have ownership over what happened to you. It’s OK to say it impacted your life at any age. Men lost their jobs. That’s a big deal. Harvey Weinstein walking to court in handcuffs – that’s a win.” Still: “It’s not enough and the legal part is mind-numbingly slow to change.”Meanwhile, the backlash is swift. “Straight, white men are in a state of disinheritance from positions of power that they assumed were their inalienable right,” says Brownstein, who gets academic when drawn on intellectual topics. “When you have so many people fearful of losing power, what they do to keep it is the brutality we’re living in. Take anti-abortion legislation – there’s such pushback when there is progress. It is not inevitable.” She sighs. “Those reminders are very desolate.”But Broken aside, The Center Won’t Hold isn’t explicitly political. “If people thought Sleater-Kinney was gonna put out some loud, anti-Trump record, they would be misguided,” says Brownstein. The restaurant has closed, so we perch outside. Sleater-Kinney have already written those songs, she laughs. “We’ve been addressing the #MeToo movement and shitty patriarchal systems of injustice and subjugation since 1995!”If anything, Trump’s presidency has forced a reconsideration of what makes art “political”. Performing rage was the preserve of punk. Now it’s mainstream discourse. “It’s really hard to want to match that level of hyperbole,” says Brownstein. “Even though I appreciate the spirit of anger, that volume has been claimed by some really terrible people.” Made by four women, the album is inherently “its own political statement”, she says. Tucker brings up Hillary Clinton: “This squashing of older women is such a part of our patriarchal culture, but it got turned up. We thought, let’s not mellow out at all, let’s take our music and see how much we can expand it, change it.”Hang on – from singing about rape culture in 1995 to the violence of capitalism on No Cities to Love, Sleater-Kinney have never been mellow. Brownstein half-agrees: “That was the whole creed we came out of – 90s punk-rock feminism – but the older you get, the scarier it is to actually say you still want to be doing this because there are fewer stories in popular music by women of a certain age. Doing that when we were younger was almost taken for granted. Now you actually have to grab for it, be a little bit greedy and voracious.”Expansive and adventurous, The Center Won’t Hold makes that statement boldly. There’s also the matter of Brownstein’s bare bum being on the cover of single Hurry on Home. She had wanted the whole band to be naked. “That was a bad idea!” Brownstein admits.Tucker – and her daughter – agreed. “I was reading her texts aloud and she was like, ‘MOM! You’re not DOING THAT!’”They cackle. They say they were too shy to celebrate their sexuality in their 20s. Brownstein claims someone once wrote an angry dissertation about a photo where her pants were visible. Plus, says Tucker, “music has always been the playground of men’s sexuality. Women have really struggled to claim their own space.” (That’s also why they think #MeToo has barely touched the music industry.)Sexual empowerment is in a state of hyper-evolution: now it would be the writer decrying Brownstein’s knickers who would be considered a traitor. “Gender as a construct is now like a mesh bag,” says Tucker, with relief. “It used to be so rigid,” says Brownstein. “The queering of the culture and the deconstruction of gender identity has freed up a lot of things for women.” She thinks her queerness challenges the idea that middle age is a sexual wasteland.It’s all in the album’s best lyric: “There’s nothing more frightening and nothing more obscene than a well-worn body demanding to be seen,” Brownstein yelps on the euphoric Love, a love letter written by Sleater-Kinney to themselves, and to resistance through collaboration. It sounds a bit different now that Weiss has left – rallying cry turned eulogy.When Weiss quit, it added to a wave of growing scepticism among the band’s hardcore fans who, it turned out, don’t really want Sleater-Kinney to change. They criticised the band’s new singles, saying that Clark’s production made them sound too much like St Vincent. They criticised Brownstein for having her bum out, concluding that she and Clark (who she once dated) must be trying to dominate the band. They accused the band of selling out for leaving indie label Sub Pop for indie label Mom + Pop. Weiss leaving was taken as proof of all this. In the comments beneath her departing statement, people called Clark “Yoko Ono”.It’s been strange to watch – indicative of a pretty limited imagination about female collaboration and ambition. Perhaps you can understand why fans would want a reliable constant during a period of political chaos that has shown, as Brownstein has said, that progress is not inevitable. And when someone leaves a totemic feminist band – ideally a crucible of shared politics – people inevitably question how they can believe in their mission if one of their members apparently didn’t. Scarier, perhaps, is the senseless way that old friendships can just end.But the criticism was misplaced. It had, in fact, been Weiss’s idea to work with Clark, who says she felt no fear about pushing Sleater-Kinney even though she was once a teenage worshipper of the band, whose posters were on her bedroom wall. After their 2006 farewell gig in New York, Clark she was “so amped up that I kicked over a newsstand in excitement”. “Now,” she thinks, “there’s a lot of ways to move people’s hearts and make them wanna kick things over and scream.”The group abandoned their original plan to work with multiple producers after their trial week with Clark in Los Angeles really took off. After that, Weiss didn’t return until the last two days of recording. She was busy, Brownstein laments in Portland. (Weiss works as a film and TV location manager, a career that started on Brownstein’s Portlandia.) There is a personal cost of being in a band, especially when each member has a very different economic reality: Brownstein a celebrity, Tucker a working mum, Weiss developing a new career.Those disparities inevitably affect what Sleater-Kinney means to everybody. “It’s tricky when it’s not the life raft you’re all on,” Brownstein says, sadly. “Not that the band needs to be a life raft the same way it might have in 1997, but it requires an urgency mixed with joy and appreciation from each of us. If it’s not there equally, it can be really hard.”As for fans’ scepticism, this wasn’t new. In 1997, Sleater-Kinney were accused of selling out when they left tiny queercore label Chainsaw for almost-as-tiny Kill Rock Stars. “From the beginning, people have knocked our ideas of ambition,” says Tucker. The point of changing label, producer and sound was change itself. “I just don’t have that relationship to what we do where I think, if we do the same thing, people will love us,” says Brownstein. “Then you’re making work by consensus, which is the worst way to make art. It lacks a point of view.” She’s steadfast: “Corin and I feel very confident that whatever we’re doing in Sleater-Kinney is Sleater-Kinney.”Weiss’s departure will affect how people hear The Center Won’t Hold. But practically speaking, Tucker and Brownstein write the songs. In our bleak postmortem interview, Brownstein shows a flash of optimism. “Corin and I started this band and we’ll end it. It was a long and really special journey with Janet, but there’s also something about it being Corin and I that feels familiar and very normal.”Tucker lights up. “I’m not going anywhere!”Brownstein laughs. “Thanks for letting me know.”They say the split isn’t acrimonious – just bad timing from someone famed for good timing. “We want Janet to be happy and healthy,” says Tucker. “If someone’s not happy doing that job, it wouldn’t be good for any of us.” And so this summer, Sleater-Kinney will be back searching for a drummer to help them smash through new ground: just the same but brand new.The Center Won’t Hold is released by Mom + Pop on 16 August. The band play London, Manchester and Glasgow in February 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a97b2c37971952b0efb6275185d4627194782ba/0_271_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c48d2a29d3eb873e91f050821670ed09","title":"creating the integrated future of english cricket in east london","story":"The ersity of Eoin Morgan’s World Cup winners has provided a platform the ECB wants to build onOn a field in east London where WG Grace notched a century in 1898, Riswan Bishar, a mobile phone shop owner originally from Islamabad, watched his son take part in a fast-developing national programme to try to use cricket to boost social and ethnic integration.Dashing after balls on Leyton cricket ground, Izaan, nine, was joined by Ongon, eight, wearing a Bangladesh cap, Orson, a nine-year old white boy in an India shirt and half a dozen others as they were put through their paces by coach Ray Tudor, a former Surrey fast bowler whose own heroes came from the fearsome West Indies team of the 1980s.The scene was a long way from the isive rhetoric of Norman Tebbit, who in 1990 when MP for neighbouring Chingford created the “cricket test” asking: “Which side do they cheer for?” and suggesting migrants who did not support England were “harking back to where you came from”.England’s win this month at the cricket World Cup, featuring leg-spinner Adil Rashid, whose parents emigrated from Pakistan, Barbados-born fast bowler Jofra Archer and Irish captain Eoin Morgan, has given the campaigns a bigger platform. The Ashes Test series against Australia offers another chance to promote the country’s level playing fields as a place for people to come together without prejudice. When Morgan said “Allah was with us” after England’s narrow victory in the World Cup final, Bishar was among those moved. “It was quite emotional for me to hear that,” he said.As he watched the boys play at Leyton, he reflected: “They will be comfortable being mixed. That’s the efforts clubs should make – make sure it is mixed. Integration is what we need now. We had the latest stabbing last week. If they were playing cricket and were in this group, they would never think about stabbing someone.”The ECB wants more south Asian players from places such as Leyton to break through into the professional game and is ploughing resources into better facilities, including more than 100 artificial pitches. Alongside the council, it has built a new indoor cricket school in Leyton.There has been a gulf in facilities, as shown by the recent emergence of an midnight to 4am league in an local Asda car park using trollies for stumps. The ECB is also targeting Asian players in Birmingham, Bradford and Leicester and over the next year has said it will consider how to encourage harder-to-reach black players into the game.“We need to capitalise on the fact Jofra is quickly becoming a role model,” said Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the ECB.Local leaders in Waltham Forest trying to prevent gang criminality and violent extremism are also pinning their hopes on cricket. The area has been beset by knife crime including a triple stabbing in April and the killing of Jaden Moodie in January. The council is considering week-long residential courses for 11 to 14-year-olds, funded by the government as part of community integration pilot schemes also happening in Peterborough, Bradford, Walsall and Blackburn.“We believe sport transcends religious boundaries, ethnicities and beliefs,” said Ahsan Khan, the Waltham Forest cabinet member for community safety, who is steering the £2m two-year pilot. “It’s a place where people come together across communities and class.”Yet many hurdles remain to greater integration in a game still perceived as elitist and expensive. South Asian cricketers often remain loyal to their own leagues, which they formed in an era of greater exclusion. More than 100 teams compete in Asian leagues in London such as the Gujarati politan Cricket League, but to rise to county level often means leaving.Efforts to persuade deprived black youths to play have also amounted to little, partly because of the competing allure of football and athletics, coaches said.“There are no black kids here,” said Tudor, who is himself black. “Football and cricket are getting exposed a lot. Cricket used to be free. Now it’s on Sky. They are thinking, who are the role models? Mine were the West Indies team and Gladstone Small, Devon Malcolm, Phillip DeFreitas,” black England bowlers of the 1980s and 90s.It is a missed opportunity for people of different backgrounds to play together in a game that offers time to observe and understand one another and thrives on differences between people to create balanced teams.The drinking culture after cricket matches can also isolate non-drinking team-mates, as was seen by Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali quickly getting out of England’s champagne-spraying group photo after winning the World Cup. At club level, non-drinking Asian players sometimes leave quickly after games when jugs of beer are produced.“It’s about ensuring that the relationship on the sports field carries on off the sports field,” said Arfan Akram, the Essex county cricket coach responsible for the amateur game in east London. “They might take it in turns about whether they go to the pub or a cafe after a match.”The ECB is also considering ways to make watching big matches more family friendly. Harrison said plans are being considered for lower-alcohol beer, specific drinking zones and entertainment programmes geared to children, to create an atmosphere that doesn’t feel like the last few hours of a drinking session.“There aren’t too many ways we can start building integration and cricket cuts through a lot of the noise and political backdrop,” said Harrison. “It comes down to a battle between bat and ball.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/652a43392929092d629af90f409a6f10c931c595/49_134_3066_1840/master/3066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=662dfa8756531f3853e09337c7b213ca","title":"sledging performance no eveidence it works","story":"When it comes to the art of sledging, few stories beat the one where Michael Slater, the fiery Australia opener, was welcomed to the crease during a Sheffield Shield match by Shane Warne and Darren Berry, intimating he was a timebomb.The tag-team verbals between Warne and Berry continued until Slater succumbed to the pressure by holing out at midwicket a few overs later. At which point they yelled out “Kaboom!” in unison.At Edgbaston on Thursday the sledging is bound to have a spikier edge. How could it not, given the ingredients in place? A first Ashes Test of the summer. Two sides laden with serial trash talkers. And the sandpapergate three – Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft – in Australia’s squad. The touchpaper, one imagines, will not be hard to find.We can quibble about whether sledging represents the spirit of cricket or where the line of acceptability should be – in any case it would surely give the Maginot Line a run for its money in terms of sheer ineffectiveness – but we rarely ask whether sledging in sport works.Academics at the University of Birmingham have just put their minds to it in a new paper, “Effects of antisocial behaviour on opponent’s anger, attention, and performance”, published in the Journal of Sports Science. Their study involved taking 60 novice basketball players and pairing each of them with a rival. The two players were then told that their goal was to beat the other person – with the winner being entered into a draw to win a £30 prize – by shooting more baskets in 10 free-throw attempts.But there was a twist. Just as one of them was about to make some throws, the rival would say something designed either to make them angry (for instance, “I think you need to go to the gym”) – or to distract them (“Make sure your laces are done up”). Performance was assessed by the number of successful baskets and a points-based scoring system, while anger and attention were measured afterwards. A control group was also in effect. The results showed that, although participants noted feeling more angry and distracted when sledged, it did not affect the overall shooting performance. The reason, the academics speculate, is that, while some players are affected by sledging, many feed off it.The only study I have found on how elite cricketers perceive sledging, conducted on 10 young players on the fringes of the first-class game by researchers at Loughborough University in 2011, found that most said it had substantial effect on their batting. However, some insisted it was not a negative at all: they needed the verbal abuse to become engaged in a match.These studies have limitations. Being abused in an academic trial is hardly the same as having 70,000 Australians questioning your manhood at the MCG. The Birmingham researchers also admit their code of ethics meant their insults were not allowed to be “offensive enough to provoke violent reactions – whereas during an actual competitive match there are fewer and less limiting constraints”.Even so, it is worth asking how much sledging should be permissible in this day and age. For decades it has largely been regarded as a legitimate act, which tests a player’s mental fortitude every bit as much as a well‑placed bouncer. Jimmy Anderson called it a skill that he regards as “one of the weapons at his disposal” while Steve Waugh coined the phrase mental disintegration, which also anticipated any objectors because, if you complained, then it indicated you were frit.The solution offered by the author of the study, published in the Journal of Sport, Ethics and Philosophy, was that players who sledge should “aim to be funny, creative, spontaneous and playful, rather than hurtful, serious, insulting, degrading and offensive” in order not to corrupt the spirit of sport.It is a noble intention but I prefer the approach employed by Viv Richards when he was sledged by the Glamorgan fast bowler Greg Thomas. After Richards had played and missed several times Thomas piped up that the ball was “red, round and weighs about five ounces, in case you were wondering”.The next ball was smashed out of the ground and into the River Taff. Thomas was sent packing too. “Hey, Greg man,” said Richards, as he followed the bowler back to his mark, “since you know the colour, shape and size, go help them find it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf3461f6d89a8664f0c0ce33884ebca3770ddaf8/122_37_1793_1076/master/1793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6289ea8229e4e0535451f1eb1f937105","title":"england v australia womens ashes second t20 live cricket","story":"The tourists cruised to another victory in the penultimate match of their dominant seriesNever in doubt. Yes, Australia did lose three wickets early on but the moment the best two players in the world came together was the moment the contest came to a close. They are unstoppable, their stand unbeaten on 87 when the winning run was scored. Lanning’s side are now one win away from going through this tour undefeated. As for Knight’s team, they are absolutely nowhere at the moment. Thanks for your company on the OBO today. We’ll be back in Bristol on Wednesday night for the final Women’s Ashes T20. Bye for now! 17.5 overs: Australia 122-3 (Lanning 43, Perry 47) Target 122. Brunt drifts onto Perry’s pads and she helps it on its way. Brunt roars with frustration. Perry becomes the first player in men or women’s T20 international cricket to collect 1000 runs and 100 wickets. Just brilliant. Brunt sprays a wide and Perry gets off strike with one, so there won’t be a fifty. Lanning has one run left to win it... and she does, with a single behind point. They’ve done it with ease.17th over: Australia 113-3 (Lanning 41, Perry 41) Target 122. Ecclestone into her last over but it doesn’t matter now in terms of this’s result. Can she get another wicket? She won’t but it is a tough set to get away, three singles their lot. The spinner finishes with 118.16th over: Australia 110-3 (Lanning 39, Perry 40) Target 122. Perry brings up the Australian 100 with style, dancing down the track at Marsh and clobbering her over the midwicket rope. Six of the best! Lanning fancies a half-century herself, dancing too before directing over mid-off with a no fuss at all for four more. Too easy. 12 off it.15th over: Australia 98-3 (Lanning 34, Perry 33) Target 122. Sciver drops short to Lanning who wants all of it, carting her through backward square on the front foot into the gap - see you later. The all-rounder wins the edge to finish but Lanning is deep in the crease cutting, running away for another four. 11 off the over. Game over. 14th over: Australia 87-3 (Lanning 25, Perry 31) Target 122. Brunt is back now too and tries to bang it in short at Perry to start her fresh set but the superstar is having none of that, leaning back to cream her through midwicket for four. The 50-partnership comes up (from 43 balls) off the next ball. There is no way that England can contain the runs remaining from here - they need wickets, pronto. 13th over: Australia 80-3 (Lanning 24, Perry 25) Target 122. Ecclestone, who has 16 from her two overs, is back for her third. Another important over: England’s best bowler has to break this up. Perry is good enough to split the gap at backward point for a couple to begin, repeating the dose to the other side of point for two more. She saves a brilliant shot for later in the over, dancing and clipping over midwicket into the gap for a timely boundary. Ecclestone forces a miscued push to mid-off to finish but the over has gone for nine. Australia need 42 runs from 42 balls to wrap up the T20 mini-series.12th over: Australia 71-3 (Lanning 23, Perry 17) Target 122. Sciver, who Isa Guha notes was England’s opening bowler in last year’s World T20, is now on. “You just want senior players saying to give them the new ball,” the former England international’s critique after that job was given to Elwiss in this innings. It is an accurate over from the strong all-rounder, going for just four singles.11th over: Australia 67-3 (Lanning 21, Perry 15) Target 122. Big over this from Kate Cross, back for her third. Seven are added, which Australia will be happy with at this stage. It would have been nine if not for an excellent e by Brunt on the backward square rope.10th over: Australia 60-3 (Lanning 19, Perry 10) Target 122. The evergeeen Marsh goes again and is where she has to be but Lanning makes room to play a stroke we saw so often on Friday night, dancing and elevating inside-out over cover for her second boundary. “What a shot,” says Charlotte Edwards on TV. “Superb.”9th over: Australia 52-3 (Lanning 13, Perry 8) Target 122. Elwiss is back for her second over and it goes a lot better than the first at the top of the innings but Perry is able to free her arms to cut one boundary along the way. Eight off it at a good time for the visitors.8th over: Australia 44-3 (Lanning 11, Perry 2) Target 122. Marsh is on and there is some action to begin, Wyatt with a chance to running out Perry but the throw isn’t on the mark. Jones tries to deflect the ball onto the stumps rather than gloving it, too. That’s a huge opportunity gone begging for the hosts - 414 with Perry gone and this is on. Even so, it’s a handy over with just three coming from it.7th over: Australia 41-3 (Lanning 9, Perry 1) Target 122. Lanning doesn’t make the same mistake as Gardner, getting four from another short and wide Cross offering, albeit off the toe end of the bat. She keeps the strike thanks to a Beaumont misfield at point. Short and wide but perhaps a little bit of extra bounce is enough to force an error from Gardner, placing Cross to Marsh at short third! Australia should still win this easily but England have a pulse.6th over: Australia 35-2 (Lanning 4, Gardner 1) Target 122. Lanning gets moving from Brunt with a couple to square leg then another to third. Gardner has walked out in front of Perry, as she did on Friday night. Brunt tries to bump her first up but it is way over head - wide ball. She gets off the mark from another shorter deliver, pulling out to deep midwicket for a single. England will have to bowl them out.Ecclestone does Mooney with one that skids on! Lovely bowling from the classy left-armer. Better still after being hit for four down the ground for four earlier in the over. England have been rinsed in this series but the left-armer leaves with her reputation enhanced.4th over: Australia 26-1 (Mooney 5, Lanning 1) Target 122. Lanning is nearly run out for a diamond duck! The throw from Cross was quick but not quite accurate enough - it needed to be perfect. Jones gets the bails but a e from the Australian skipper gets her home. Mooney isn’t far away from losing her wicket too, miscuing a short-arm jab out to deep square leg, falling just metres in front of Wyatt. It is always eventful when Katherine Brunt is at the bowling crease. Brunt gets Healy first ball! It was short but the extra pace did the damage, winning a top edge on the pull that Jones takes well. 3rd over: Australia 23-0 (Healy 20, Mooney 3) Target 122. Sure enough, Ecclestone is right on the money and doesn’t allow Mooney or Healy anything to hit. She’s without doubt England’s best bowler.2nd over: Australia 21-0 (Healy 19, Mooney 2) Target 122. Cross gets the second over rather than the first. Mooney is off strike with one to square leg to begin. Healy gets another chance for easy runs off her pads, clipping four more when Cross misses her mark. Too easy. Elwiss hasn’t opened the bowling in any match since 2012, Lydia Greenway tells us on the television. What a strange decision. 1st over: Australia 14-0 (Healy 14, Mooney 0) Target 122. A rank full toss allows Healy to get busy from the second ball of the chase, smashing her over midwicket with ease for four. Next up, she overcorrects and allows the Australian opener to crunch four more over point. More width now, Healy cutting a couple more well stopped by Ecclestone on the rope. A third boundary to finish, steering with ease to the third man rope. Starts don’t come much gentler than that. They could win this in a real hurry. As Mel Jones says on TV, why is Elwiss bowling the first over? Odd. The players are back on the field! Elwiss is taking the new ball at Healy, who is opening with Mooney. PLAY! Back in 15 for the chase. See you then. 20th over: England 121-8 (Ecclestone 17, Marsh 1) Ecclestone does the job at the death, making room to lift Schutt over long-off, just clearing Haynes’ fingertips. That six It gets England beyond a run a ball, which isn’t a bad effort considering how poorly they batted.Ecclestone takes Schutt through the gap at midwicket for four to begin the over but there is a bad mix-up from the second delivery, Elwiss coming back for a second run out to backward square but the spinner wasn’t coming. Gardner’s throw and Healy’s backhanded effort with the gloves were enough to get Australia an eighth wicket. 19th over: England 108-7 (Elwiss 5, Ecclestone 6) Five singles to the sweepers but they can find the gaps against Jonassen. She finishes with 219 with nine dots along the way. She’s been excellent.“Insofar as placement of fielders is concerned,” emails Sarah Bacon, “while England has managed to loft a few past the fingertips of the Aussie fielders, I think that Australia is proving better equiped in this area. Thoughts?”Yep, Australia have outcaught England comprehensively in this series. The hosts looked overwhelmed in the field on Friday. 18th over: England 103-7 (Elwiss 3, Ecclestone 3) England have raised their 100 with an Elwiss single to cover but there isn’t much to get excited about in another successful over. Brunt was actually given out caught before she was stumped, ala Brian Lara v Zoe Goss.Brunt dances at Kimmince but she sees her coming, sending it out wide and beating the bat, Healy doing the rest after missing the bails to begin. But it doesn’t matter - the ‘keeper has loads of time. 17th over: England 98-6 (Brunt 6, Elwiss 1) The third ump takes their time to give Elwiss not out, her e to Healy’s end over the line. She is then off the mark first ball in her first T20 since 2016.Straight down backward square’s throat! Winfield had to go and hit it well but has picked out the boundary rider. 16th over: England 94-5 (Winfield 12, Brunt 3) Whoa, a SIX! The first of the innings. A fine one too, Winfield taking Wareham straight back over her head. The first boundary in six overs. By contrast, Australia struck 40 (nine sixes, 31 fours) on Friday night. A lot of work to do.15th over: England 84-5 (Winfield 4, Brunt 1) Big appeal for lbw, Healy insisting that Kimmince had Winfield, but turned down. Must have been very close but without DRS, we’ll never know. Sigh. A wide and three singles isn’t going to be enough to get this tally up to anything credible so they’re going to have to bowl the house down.14th over: England 80-5 (Winfield 2, Brunt 0) Brunt considered paddling the first ball of her afternoon but pulled out of it. She isn’t able to beat the field to get off the mark. One wicket and one run from the Wareham over, her figures now 212 from three. Tip top.A gentle return catch, taken with ease by the leggie. The England captain danced at her but didn’t quite get to the pitch, checking a drive but only only managing to give catching practice. 13th over: England 79-4 (Knight 17, Winfield 1) Winfield is off the mark first ball to midwicket. She was good the other night after coming in for Sarah Taylor. Usually an opener, of course. Nothing left to chance by Jonassen, bowling Beaumont. She misses a reverse sweep, nutmegged. The delivery was fuller and quicker the spinner might have saw her coming. Fine bowling. 12th over: England 74-3 (Beaumont 42, Knight 14) Mooney drops another off Beaumont! It’s a tougher than the previous over, above her head on the circle at mid on, but she got both hands to it. Earlier in the set, Knight nearly did exactly the same thing, only just clearing the Queenslander in that position. Of course, she’s a wicketkeeper at domestic level but plays in the Australian team as a specialist bat. Eight from it, giving England something of a platform.11th over: England 66-3 (Beaumont 37, Knight 11) DROPPED! Mooney took a fantastic snaffle earlier but has put down an easy one here, Beaumont the recipient of the life after chipping Kimmince to long-on at a very catchable height. The all-rounder had a good shout against Beaumont for leg before in her first over, too. But she survives. It’s still a good over for Lanning’s side, only four added.10th over: England 62-3 (Beaumont 35, Knight 9) Beaumont is well enough set that she is happy to take on Molineux and does it really well twice in a row, dancing to punch the spinner over her head then flicking her just as effectively over midwicket for four more. 9th over: England 51-3 (Beaumont 25, Knight 8) Ooooh! Knight was run out on Friday and so nearly again here. Haynes has a great arm but the throw from short third isn’t on target at the non-strikers’ end. After the dicey moment to begin it is a prodcutive over, finished off with a well-timed cut by the captain for four. They need her here.8th over: England 43-3 (Beaumont 23, Knight 2) After watching a couple to begin, Knight gets off the mark with a sweep to midwicket, two further singles exchanged on the posh side to finish the successful Wareham over. She’s a very good cricketer. Sciver bowled around her front pad! The legspinner Wareham gets a wicket first ball. The England all-rounder went across her stumps in an effort to paddle past fine leg but got cramped and missed the ball.7th over: England 40-2 (Beaumont 22, Sciver 8) Schutt is so hard to get away with her natural movement and changes of pace. In turn, both Sciver and Beaumont are happy to focus on turning the strike over, collecting five risk-free singles. Better batting now.6th over: England 35-2 (Beaumont 20, Sciver 5) Good batting from Beaumont, middling Jonnasen over mid-on for a once-bounce four to end the power play on a positive note. Four singles along with that four makes eight from the over, England’s most convincing so far.“Afternoon Adam.” Hello David Langlois. “Do you think Elysse Perry gets quite the credit she deserves?. Where is there a more versatile or effective sportsperson on the planet? They day she wins SPOTY overseas sports personality of the year I’ll begin believing her incredible achievements are recognised in England (it’s not going to happen, but it should).”In Australia, she is absolutely a household name. But that hasn’t been by accident. The investment made in putting women’s cricket on free TV over the last four summers is really paying off.5th over: England 27-2 (Beaumont 14, Sciver 3) The squeeze is already on. Molineux is straight where she needs to be, just four runs taken out to the sweeper at cover but without threatening the rope.Jonassen is into the book with the final ball of an excellent first over, getting rid of Wyatt. The punchy opener danced at her in an effort to plonk it over long-on but didn’t get much of it, wonderfully taken by Mooney running back with the flight of the ball. Perfect technique.3rd over: England 22-1 (Wyatt 9, Beaumont 12) Buzzers! Did we call overthrows that before David Lloyd? Not to worry England has four of them with Wareham taking a ping at Beaumont’s end from cover but it spills away to the rope. Australia won’t mind that - the young spinner did execute a fine run out in the World T20 final last year, Mel Jones reminds me on TV. Earlier in the Perry set, Beaumont played the shot of the day so far, crunching past point. This was the ground where the pocket rocket made the first of her three international centuries last summer, earning a Wisden gong. 2nd over: England 11-1 (Wyatt 8, Beaumont 2) Four more off the edge! This time Wyatt is trying to deflect behind point but it flies through second slip. An top first over from Australia’s swing master.1st over: England 6-1 (Wyatt 4, Beaumont 1) After a legside wide to begin before the wicket, Beaumont gets the board moving via the bat with one to long leg. Wyatt too with an edge that would have gone straight to first slip if Perry had one! Perfect outswinging delivery deserved a second scalp not four runs. “Where’s the slip?” asks Mel Jones on television. With all that movement, it’s a good question. The hold Perry has on Jones! She has her again. It is a dreadful shot too, gifting a limp catch to cover point. The fourth time she has picked her up in the series. No footwork. Horrible cricket. The players are on the field. This series has been such a massive mismatch since the opening exchanges, England winning about five of the 50 hours played thereafter. Let’s hope that by batting first here at Hove today, the hosts get a big competitive total and we have ourselves an interesting afternoon. Wyatt and Jones are opening for England, Perry taking the first over with the ball. PLAY! The restructure. There has been a lot of debate since England lost the Ashes about what women’s cricket is going to look like in this country as of next summer, when the new domestic plan kicks in. The ECB’s women’s cricket supremo, Clare Connor, has been on TMS and Sky TV before play talking about this very topic. I’ll get those comments to you as soon as they appear on the wires, et al. Let’s talk, by the way. Email, twitter - you know the drill.Confirmation from the England camp that Shrubsole was left out, not injured. That’s a big call but she hasn’t been at her best. Have a read of Megan Schutt’s column. She’s a gem. It makes complete sense to me that we become a republic. In doing so, I hope Australia can move forward in a whole range of areas, especially the way we officially appreciate our Indigenous history. It’s just ridiculous to me that we have a union jack on our flag but no reference to our Aboriginal people, and the date of Australia Day has to change.That will be a relief for Heather Knight, the home skipper. The big news from the middle is that England’s vice-captain, Anya Shrubsole, has been left out of the playing XI. Of course, she had 50 taken from her three overs during Lanning’s masterclass on Friday. Australia, as we expected, are unchanged. We’re in Brighton for the weekend! Well, strictly speaking we’re in Hove for Sunday afternoon but we’re happy all the same. It’s muggy and sticky and the track looks a road. After Australia’s utterly dominant 93-run triumph in the first rubber on Friday, they have an unbeatable 10-2 points lead but England can still win these T20s as they did in the corredponding series in November 2017. I’ll be back with the toss and the teams in a tick. Good afternoon!

A 67 to finish, a quite brilliant round of golf on a day when her closest competitors capitulated.Ko has been made to wait quite a while. Park wedges out to five feet. Ko then gets her chance to putt. She rolls her birdie effort four feet past. Kim knocks her birdie putt in for a 73. She’s -13 and will have a share of second place. She’ll be ruing that tee shot on 14. Park then sends her par putt three feet past. Bogey, a miserable 75, and she ends the week at -10, tied for sixth. The fiasco of the 18th hole was her round in microcosm.A farcical end to Park’s round. She’s squatting on a rock in the middle of the flower bed, wondering what the situation with a loose impediment is. She’s allowed to move it without penalty. Then she bashes out of the flowers, Caddyshack style, over the green and into the deep rough on the other side. Not bad given she was still balancing on that rock. Ko does what she needs to do. A wedge into the heart of the green from 100 yards. She’s not particularly close, 30 feet away perhaps, but then she’ll have three putts for victory! Kim, the pressure off, wedges to six feet.Ko and Kim lay up with their second shots. Park Sung-hyun decides to go for it, taking out the fairway wood, and sends a huge slice into the flower arrangement to the right of the green. That might even have bounced a little further, in which case it’s out of bounds. But we’ll see. Either way, it’s a denouement in keeping with her dismal final round.Up on the green, Inbee Park pars to sign for a very disappointing 73. Like her namesake Sung-hyun, she wasn’t at the races today. She ends the week at -9, yet again tied for eighth, equalling her best finish in this event, a result she achieved in 2015 and 2018. The super grand slam still eludes her.One of the most important tee shots of Ko Jin-young’s life coming up. She plays it safe with a 3-wood ... and that sensationally smooth swing doesn’t let her down. Down the fairway. Two careful shots to the green, and this is all over! Fine drives by Kim and Park, too, as they realistically look for the final birdies that’ll improve their position. Feng wedges into the last. It’s decent, nothing more, and she’s left with a 20-footer for a closing birdie. Her putt is a fine effort, gently oscillating this way and that. But it somehow stops on the right lip. It’s a fine 66, and that’s a share of the clubhouse lead with Kupcho. And here’s the thin line between success and failure: back on 17, Ko curls in a left-to-right birdie putt! She’s waving her putter in the sky before the ball drops. A perfect putt, perfectly timed in narrative terms. As Kim and Park par, she walks off to the 18th tee with a two-shot lead.Ko sends her second at 17 over the flag. She’ll have a look at birdie from 20 feet coming back. That’s decent enough, given the state of play, and she shares a laugh and a joke with her caddie. Kim is just inside her, and really needs to make her putt if she’s to salvage this situation. Park’s approach is down a swale to the left every time she’s taken a step forward today, she slides straight back.Ko, Kim and Park all bash their tee shots at 17 straight down the middle. Up on 18, Feng lays up with her second. This is coming rather deliciously to the boil.Feng’s drive at 18 is arrowed down the middle. Exactly what’s required. Back on 16, the leader Ko knocks her tee shot over the flag to 12 feet, but the left-to-right birdie putt’s never dropping. Par for Kim. And birdie for Park Sung-hyun, whose world-number-one-style tee shot lands 12 feet to the right of the flag, kicks left off the bank, and stops three feet from the hole. She’s not quite out of it yet! This final round took quite a while to ignite - blame the incessant rain - but my word what a finish we have here! So many possibilities!It was a strong finish by Moriya Jutanugarn. Birdies at 16 and 18, the latter reward for a wedge sent to kick-in distance. She signs for a 68 and ends the week at -10. Then eagle for her sister Ariya, coming up behind, and she’s shot 68 as well, finishing a shot better off at -11. Meanwhile on 17, Shanshan Feng isn’t finished: she fizzes her second shot to 15 feet, and guides in the left-to-right curler for birdie! She’s just a shot off the lead at -13, and with the relatively easy par-five 18th to come!No bounce-back birdie for Kim on 15. She nearly curls in a big right-to-left breaker from the fringe, but par will have to do, and her head drops a little. Park duffs a chip from the side of the green, and then hits the flagstick again with another overcooked wedge. This one doesn’t drop, but the tap-in that’s left limits the damage to bogey. She’s -10. And finally Ko’s birdie putt slips by. Par.Jennifer Kupcho tidies up for her birdie on 18! That’s three birdies in the last four holes, and he’s one off the lead. A magnificent 66 of carpe-diem brilliance from the Augusta National amateur champion!Kupcho chips up from the bank. Her ball bounds ten feet past the hole, but stops softly and then is gathered back towards the cup by the camber of the green. She’ll have a five-footer to make that birdie. Though up on 15, Ko takes three careful shots down the middle of the par five, and she’ll have a look at birdie from 12 feet. It might be enough to seal the deal.Jennifer Kupcho has clearly decided that she’s not going to leave Évian-les-Bains wondering. Out comes the fairway wood at 18. She’s going for it, over the creek. And she only just makes it, the ball snagging on the bank on the other side. That was a yard away from a watery grave. You’ve got to admire her style. Up and down for birdie, and she’ll be signing for her second 66 of the week ... and setting a clubhouse lead of -13. If she can make it, she’ll be posing the leader Ko Jim-young a question.Kim was two shots clear not very long ago. Now she’s two behind. How on earth will she respond to the dramatic events on 14? Her tee shot back there wasn’t great, but even so, plugging right up against the face was outrageously bad luck. Consider the fortune of Sung-hyun Park, whose tee shot was no better, and whose bunker shot was really travelling. It sounds ridiculous, but it really is a thin line between birdie and triple bogey. Golf, right there, in a nutshell.Kim putts from the fringe and nearly sinks an outrageous bogey putt, the ball slithering this way and that over a couple of humps. But it rolls six feet past, and she can’t make the one coming back. A triple bogey. Meanwhile Ko lags a wonder putt from 70 feet to kick-in distance. Par, and she’s suddenly two shots in the lead! And if that’s not enough drama, up on 17, Kupcho sends her tee shot down the right, forcing her to go over some trees if she wants to reach the green. A sensational wedge over lands on the fringe, and she rattles in a 25-footer for her fourth birdie of the day! All of a sudden, everything’s changed. Major-championship golf, folks, right here!Less than half of Kim’s ball is visible. She does extremely well to blast it straight into the air, avoiding the face. But it lands on the bank and topples back in. Adding insult to injury, it lands in her deep footprint. That’s awful luck. But instead of bemoaning her luck, she quickly gets back to work, and splashes out before the situation overwhelms her. It’s a fine escape, though her ball only just reaches the fringe. Kim’s lie: it’s a horror show. Plugged, right under the lip. Before she can work out what to do, Park - also in the bunker - whips a hot one out. The ball would have flown miles past the flag, perhaps off the other side of the green ... had it not hit the flagstick and dropped into the cup! An outrageous birdie that brings her back to -11. And with Kim in all sorts of bother, she’s no longer out of this!Ko takes 6-iron on the par-three 14th. Not enough club, though it finds the front of the long, deep green. Kim sends her hybrid into the deep bunker to the right of the dancefloor. Advantage Ko, just about, though much will depend on Kim’s lie.Ko Jin-young makes a move on 13! She sinks a long right-to-left swinger for a birdie out of nowhere, and the gap is down to one again. Pars for the leader Kim Hyo-joo and Park Sung-hyun. And Jennifer Kupcho gets out of 16 with a par, lagging her long birdie putt to the cup and tidying up.Kupcho plays the game with a smile. She wedges her tee shot into the heart of the short par-three 16th. The ball screws back violently and nearly topples into the lake, but is held up by the fringe. So nearly a fine shot so nearly a disaster. But the young American simply laughs casually. Still, that’ll be a tricky two putts for par, up against the fringe.Jennifer Kupcho is the real deal. She’s had a year to remember already, winning the inaugural Augusta Women’s Amateur title, and turning professional. But now she’s threatening to win her first major in only her eighth start as a pro! Birdie at 15 now, her third of the day, the rest pars. She’s four back at -11, but remember there’s an eagle chance at the 18th. And if the leaders wobble ... well, what a story this would be. Whatever happens, though, she’s announced herself as a real talent.The start of a late surge by Inbee Park? It’s almost certainly too late, but having birdied 11, she drains a monster right-to-left curler on 13 to move up to -9. Hopes of a first Evian Championship for the seven-time major winner aren’t quite extinguished yet, but she’ll need a superb finish, and hope that Kim Hyo-joo and Ko Young-jin both collapse ignominiously.Park’s par putt at 12 is never dropping, and there goes yet another shot. The world number one is four over for her round today. Quite a contrast to her first three rounds of 67, 66 and 66. She really doesn’t like wet and cold conditions. Not that her partners do any better on the hole, which is playing as the hardest today. Both miss their par savers, and there’s a bit of backslide at the top of the leaderboard.Kim’s splash from sand is tentative, and only just creeps over the face and out. Her ball rolls apologetically onto the fringe. Ko clips crisply to eight feet, not good, not bad from where she was, down the bank in tousled nonsense. But Park, just off the side, chunks her chip. She’s left with a 20-footer coming back. The former US Open and PGA winner is way off her game today.Kim’s second into 12 takes a huge kick left and bounds into a greenside bunker. The door’s ajar for Ko, but her second lands hard on the green and sails long and left. She’s worried it’s gone out of bounds, but it’s OK, in so much as it’s in the filthy rough. Park follows her in. All three with work to do for their pars.Ariya Jutanugarn has been quite the entertainer around the turn. Birdies at 8 and 9, bogey at 10, birdie at 11, and now bogey at 12. She’s -9. Meanwhile Shanshan Feng, having turned in 32, bogeyed 10 and lipped out for birdie on 11 she’s four back at -12.Park Sung-hyun can’t say she hasn’t had the breaks today. Her second shot into the trees was abysmal, but her ball rebounds out of the forest and lands in the semi-rough again. And there’s a route into the green. She wedges a delightful third to 12 feet - the cream always rises - but her flat stick is stone cold. Her chance of saving an unlikely par trundles three feet past, then she yips the one coming back. A double-bogey six, and with the leader Kim making her birdie putt - Ko settles for par - the world number-one looks a beaten docket today.It could be the end of Park Sung-hyun’s bid, too. Her driving has been off all day, and on 11 she sends a big hook into the trees. She gets a member’s bounce back into the semi-rough, but she’s lost a lot of yardage. So out comes too much club. Not enough loft to get over the trees at the side of the gentle dogleg left. She fires her ball low and left, straight into the branches and more trouble. Meanwhile Kim and Ko both wedge their second shots to 12 feet, setting up good looks at birdie. There could be some significant separation at the top soon.Moriya Jutanugarn’s race is run. A double bogey at 12 after finding herself plugged in a bunker by the green. She slips to -8. She’s alongside Carlota Ciganda, whose consistency in the majors, without reward, is almost Rickie Fowleresque. She’s got the game to become Spain’s first major winner. Perhaps next week at Woburn. But it won’t be today. Still, birdies at 10 and 13 have lifted her up the standings. Shot of the day, perhaps the entire week, by Ko Jin-young at 10! The reigning ANA champ whips a wedge from 140 yards to a matter of inches, the ball nearly slam-dunking straight into the cup, bouncing a second time right next to the pin, and landing a foot past. She’ll tap that in to move to within a shot of the leader! Ko is the only player in the final group under par. She’s the one who looks like seizing the day, because that was simply sensational! Pars meanwhile for Sung-hyun Park and Kim, and this is becoming very interesting now.It’s taken the last group two hours and 48 minutes to complete the front nine. The conditions, the threesomes, and the lift, clean and place rules haven’t helped. But it’s been slow nonetheless. An awful lot of time being taken over some very short putts, to no apparent benefit in terms of quality. You have to wonder whether professionals across the board would be better served taking these short ones quickly, without too much thought, like Darren Clarke used to do. Park Sung-hyun’s speed-to-result ratio today has been particularly poor. Brooks Koepka speaks for the HBH report on this topic.Kim pulls her putt to the left. Par. Ko then prods with great uncertainty at her shorter effort, and it dribbles away to the right. And finally Park tugs her one left. Nobody will be particularly happy with that miserable collection of putts, though in the context of the tournament that’s a huge let-off for the leader Kim, who remains two in front."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a07db350cfcc05bb07ab7e16639b701ff6513b84/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b95e68265c968f21d7e4c55c375081d5","title":"f1 german grand prix live lewis hamilton pole bottas vettel verstappen leclerc","story":"Red Bull’s Max Verstappen took glory at Hockenheim, while Lewis Hamilton was left in a spinRight, that’s us - I’m off for a metaphorical lie-down. Stick with us for more reaction, and Giles Richards’ report from Hockenheim. Thanks for your company - ta-ra. Anyway, how do the driver standings look? “It’s a day to learn,” deadpans Mercedes honcho, Toto Wolff. He is not all that happy with life. What a shame if that’s the last German Grand Prix for a while. It does sort of look that way, but Formula 1 being Formula 1, you never know. The band strike up and what a race that was! The podium lads raise their trinkets and out comes the fizz! Podium and anthem time! Ok, let’s have a full list of finishers:Before the last safety car, Vettel thought he could do something because he felt like he was faster than the others, so passing them was relatively straightforward. “It was a long race,” says Vettel. “At some points it felt like it was never ending, but it was good fun.”Verstappen says it was amazing out there, he enjoyed it and it was all about trying not to make too many mistakes in really difficult conditions. “All credit in the world to Verstappen,” says Amanda Orson, “but Vettel going from #20 to #2 is just incredible. He should have been Driver of the Day.”Can’t argue with that. Verstappen gets out of his car and celebrates his second win in three races with his team. “What a race” says Vettel, an observation accurate both generally and specifically. “What a result!” says Verstappen to his team. He is delighted, and why not. And Sebastian Vettel comes second from the back of the grid, with Daniil Kvyat coming third! Lap 6364 Come on! Vettel absolutely mashes Kvyat on the straight and the crowd go wild! He’s second now, while Versatappen leads by more than four seconds! But what an effort from Vettel, who started at the back of the grid! Lap 6264 Albon blocks off Gasly and Gasly can’t stay away, bumping him and ruining his own chances± Lap 6164 Verstappen extends his lead - it’s 2.475s to Kvyat, who leads Stroll ... no he doesn’t! He can’t handle Vettel’s power, and Vettel takes him out!Lap 6164 Juna Pablo Montoya once finished second from the back of the grid can Vettel get onto the podium? He’s fourth, less than half a second behind Stroll!Lap 6064 Vettel gains on Sainz, who holds him off, then Vettel sorts him on the inside! Superb! Then Albon does Gasly to move sixth and it’s all going on! Lap 5964 The safety car departs and Verstappen steps on it! Five laps to go! Lap 5964 Right, our placing:Lap 5864 Bottas’ gaffer was proper vex when he spun off. Lovely stuff. Lap 5864 They reckon it’ll take three laps to remove Bottas’ debris as Hamilton pits again presumably he’s seeking a fastest lap point, though needs to get into the top 10 for that. Lap 5764 Back comes the safety car as we see Bottas’s spin - he slides on a bit of water and his rear tyres take him off. That will not be unwelcome to the 15th-placed Hamilton did I say 15th? I meant 15th and last. Lap 5664 Sainz is now in that battle for third with Stroll and Bottas, with Vettel behind them in sixth place. Lap 5564 Verstappen leads by 9.903 from Kvyat, while Bottas tries to relieve Stroll of his third place. Verstappen just got his tyres exactly right, while the rain came at exactly the wrong point for Hamilton. Lap 5464 Hamilton is 14th now, and pits for a change of tyres! He needs something out of Wacky Races! Lap 5364 It’s impossible to see anyone catching Verstappen now, and with Kvyat behind him we’re looking at a Honda one-two ... but then Hamilton goes off the track! He went wide at a corner, too wide, spun, and though he managed to right himself lost plenty of time in so doing. His run of 22 point-accumulating races is surely at an end! Lap 5264 Vettel is carving through the field, currently sitting seventh but lapping fastest of all of them. Hamilton has been extremely quiet since finding himself 12th.Lap 5164 Stroll was the first Canadian to lead a race since Jacques Villeneuve, but now he’s third - Kvyat passes him. The gap to Verstappen is 9.128s Lap 5064 Albon goes by Magnussen as the track dries out...Lap 4864 This is an absolutely ridiculous race! Verstappen nails Stroll and records the fastest lap of the race, then seconds later Kvyat beats it in between the two is Stroll, and fourth is Bottas, fifth is Sainz, sixth is Magnussen. Lap 4864 Hamilton pits and Stroll takes the lead! Verstappen is just behind - 0.176s - and Hamilton serves his penalty to rejoin the race in twelfth. Lap 4764 Bottas pits too and Hamilton leads the race now, 2.556s ahead of Raikkonen, from Vettel, from Giovinazzi, from Stroll, from Verstappen. Lap 4664 Off goes the safety car and Albon and Sainz both attack Hamilton! One on each side! But around the corner he holds it down! Albon then finds himself sliding from fourth to eighth, while in front Verstappen extends his lead to 3.964 before pitting for slicks!

What makes people do that? “I applaud your coverage these past three weeks,” says Loretta Ebert. “I am in the US and have been hospitalised with a fractured pelvis and your commentary and input from others has kept me sane. The race itself was one of the best in last few years and I applaud Alaphilippe’s courage. I was sorry to see Pinot’s abandonment. He might have made for a thrilling end in the last two stages. As for Paris, a great city but agree the food is overrated.”Gosh, hope you’re on the mend. We’re coming up to Versailles so let’s have a Versailles fact: despite not being in the capital, and not having been home to a royal family for quite sometime, it canes Buckingham Palace for number of visitors. Sagan and his domestique are at the front, Nibali behind them. Greater even than Frosties? 91.8km to go. Everyone’s having a nice time. “ As others have said, thanks for the Tour coverage,” says Gilman Miller. “I’m no tour historian but my general observations on what made this tour stand out are, first, only one inidual time trial and not a terribly long one (this helped Egan limit his losses, and meant that time trialing was not the most valuable skill in determining the winner), the team time trial is stupid, and I would expect and hope that future tours will have a couple time trials again. Second, the Alpsfinal mountain stage coming right at the end meant that so much more was in balance till the end, I feel like in most past tours the last few days before Paris have been without mountain drama. Third, I think that because JA was not considered a GC threat he was allowed to gain more time than was wise at the outset, and because he climbs pretty well and time trials very well, he managed to hang on to it longer than anyone imagined. Fourth, Froome’s injury seemingly made Ineos less dominant, and Ineos still had to deal with a two-headed team leader, which led to confusion, and less dominance, no real boss of the tour and its pace. Imagine if Froome was there and the two leaders were him and G, with Egan left to be their super mountain helper, following team orders and not pursuing his own glory?”Nicely done. We had a teacher at school called Mr Gilman, and he was once on what was known as bus-stop duty. This involved making sure everyone - and we’re talking around 1000 kids - got onto buses going down Camden Road in orderly fashion. Part of the job was also making sure members of the public were allowed to get on first, and he once ushered someone on, who took exception to the effrontery of being told what he could do. So he gave him a slap. I’d like to say no one laughed. “I used to be in the overrated camp,” says Michael Ireton of Paris. ‘Then I studied art and architectural history. Now firmly--VERY firmly--in the great city camp. So much art and architecture to see, from age-old to cutting edge contemporary.”I think it was doing A-level European history post-1814 that did it for me, then doing revolution stuff at university. There’s such a sense of serious stuff having happened on the streets. Steven Kruijswijk is pretty chuffed with his third place. “A great feeling,” he says. “Today’s not the day for a punch-up,” says Drew Goldie, “so apologies for this, but if Guy Hornsby didn’t think last year’s Tour was gripping (vis. his reference to Thomas’s speech) I think he’s missing out. The race up to La Rosiere when Thomas took yellow was amazing and throughout the race no-one - not FroomeThomasSkytheir opponents, especially Du Moulin, and me - knew if Froome would eventually fire, and the tension was wonderful. I actually thought Du Moulin might exploit the Sky uncertainty, but it turned out that Thomas exploited Du Moulin’s. Add the usual baffling Movistar tactics, and the permutations were endless. I know it’s fashionable, and very correct, to bemoan the Sky years, and only good manners has prevented most from cheering that Froome’s not here, but last year’s race was compelling.”It’s always the day for a punch-up. Just over 100km to go. Dey Bardet, king of the mountains, takes some congratulations. Paris, then. Overrated, or one of the greatest cities in the world? I’m the former and my missus is closer to the latter. I’d agree with her that the food is overrated - too rich, too bland - but the history is so emotionally overwhelming and there are very few cities of which that can be said. “Thanks to the  live blog team,” says the Costa Brava’s Gareth Thomas. “As I’m watching the TDF in a bar, it’s too noisy to hear the Spanish commentator. With the visuals on the big screen, the commentary from the  live blog, and of course a cold beer, it all works fine!”I just had a swing of water in my north London box room, so we’re in the same zone. I have a friend who reckons that Bernal’s Colombia is the greatest country in South America. I find it hard to see how anywhere can be better than Brazil (the obvious criticism ignored for a moment). Am I wrong? “He didn’t really get ‘that’ close,” tweets Jeremy CP. “Full stages yesterday and Friday and he may have been 10-20+ minutes down. For a Frenchman, talk about Pinot not Alaphilippe.”Wiggins is with Brailsford, who says winning never gets old, and agrees that Bernal’s maturity exceeds his age. It’s extremely revealing stuff. 114.4km to go. “This has honestly been the most enjoyable Tour for many many years,” reckons Guy Hornsby. “And I say this as a huge British cycling fan who’s been spoilt with a cavalcade of victories in Grand Tours since Wiggins broke through. While those were massive for cycling, the means in which they were achieved were seldom memorable, even with G last year (his winner’s speech was probably the highlight of the race). Sky’s dominance sapped so much enjoyment out of those wins. But this year they struggled to control things, and the race erupted into flamboyance, chaos and attacks, with a leader no one foresaw and a winner most didn’t expect for a few years. It’s almost a shame he’s part of the Ineos machine, but perhaps he wouldn’t have won without it. So thanks for the panache, Julien, the effort G, the climbs Pinot, and the skills, Egan. What a win. Thanks for you lot all too, for making the MBM such fun. My money’s on Caleb Ewan next.”“Hello Daniel,” says Alan Amos. With regard to your comment, ‘I wonder if Alaphilippe can make the necessary improvements between now and next term, or if it’s just a physiological hurdle that he’ll never overcome’: Would he want to try? As far as I can see it, neither he nor his team were aiming at GC in this Tour, nor have Quick-Step had a rider that was capable of taking on such a challenge in the decades that the team has existed. To radically change the aims of the team towards GC in a grand tour for next year would be such a change I couldn’t imagine it happening: at the same time, I can’t see Alaphilippe leaving them. We’ll see what happens next...”Yes, but he got so close – I know he sort of said he never thought it was on, but the way he responded on the first Alp stage suggested to the contrary. Once people have had a taste...What could they do to make this stage more of a thing and less of a jaunt? Wild animals en route? Sagan photobombs Bernal and Ineos’ moment, then they raise glasses and guzzle. Bernal has another, and Thomas enjoys one too. More news as I get it. We see it slowmo and actually that’s a pretty good neck from yerman, hurled straight down, no fuss. Bernal has champagne in his hand, and clinks flute with whoever’s in the car next to him. He sees it away, lad that he is. Wiggins says the bonhomie on this stage gets boring after a bit. “You just wanna race.” The stage starts! Alaphilippe pretends to attack, wag that he is. I wonder if Alaphilippe can make the necessary improvements between now and next term, or if it’s just a physiological hurdle that he’ll never overcome. It’s another belting day in France, after that little mountain interlude. Bernal and Alaphilippe blather togather, which is nice to see. Off they head to the start. Bernal looks pretty relaxed, all things considered.

She pulls up two red plastic chairs and sits herself down on one, her laptop open on her knees. The videos are part of an edgy multimedia tribute to Kathy Acker that sprawls across the ICA’s lower floors. Valk is here to add a final theatrical flourish, directing a previously unstaged script by the pirate queen of 70s and 80s counterculture.With its ornate cornicing and makeshift furniture, this deserted chamber could be a set for the Wooster group, the New York-based theatre ensemble to which Valk has belonged for the last four decades. Screens are everywhere in their shows, and at one moment – when trying to demonstrate the way in which she works – Valk puts her laptop down on the bare floor and starts to speak directly to it. “I can facilitate an encounter with the text,” she says. “This. Is. An. Encounter.”Though unknown to the wider world apart from through a couple of film cameos, most recently in Jonathan Demme’s The Manchurian Candidate, among Wooster Groupies, Valk is a legend. Described by one admirer as “the Meryl Streep of Downtown”, she has been a constipated, comically unco-ordinated Phedre (To You, The Birdie!), a blacked-up Brutus Jones (The Emperor Jones), a Betty Boop-ish Dr Faustus (HouseLights).Her most recent London appearance was in The Town Hall Affair at the Barbican last year, wreaking merry havoc as the radical lesbian Jill Johnston, one of the participants in a celebrated 1971 face-off between Norman Mailer and Germaine Greer. But all her attention today is on how to make sense of the late, great disruptor Acker.Though this isn’t a Wooster Group show, she has flown in with two young colleagues – another will join them later – for a collaboration with three UK-based performers, who were auditioned over Skype. The six have just three weeks to animate Desire, a mashup of dialogue, prose and stage directions, in English and French, featuring a roll call of potty-mouthed Shakespearean characters, and a walk-on for Wuthering Heights’ Heathcliff.“I didn’t pick it it picked me,” she says. “I don’t know what I’m trying to do yet, but this is a unique opportunity for me to have my moment as a director.” Then she corrects herself in the curious vocabulary of the Wooster Group, saying she is not the director but the instigator. “I like the term ‘instigating a performance’,” she says, “but, as a 62-year-old person with a lot of experience, I’m in charge of the instigation.”Desire is different, not only because it is being put together is such a short time and will run for only five performances. “It’s also exciting to me because this is not a theatre, it’s an arts organisation. So I feel at liberty to explore myself in a different way,” says Valk.Both the Wooster Group and Acker were idiosyncratic stars of the late-20th-century New York avant garde, but that doesn’t mean they inhabited the same space. Valk joined the Wooster group aged 21 in 1979, talking her way into lodgings above their theatre, The Performing Garage in SoHo, on the promise of being able to make costumes and props. A few miles away, Acker was holding court with a different sort of performance, based on her own highly sexualised persona.“There was something about her writing that was too aggressive for me,” says Valk. “I didn’t have the same relationship to sex. I wasn’t interested in taking on the male mind, getting inside it and taking it down. I’d gravitated towards a group with a woman in charge. The theatre was where I lived both in body and metaphorically.”But, on a visit to London in the late 80s, she was intrigued enough to take up an invitation to meet Acker at the Groucho club and was surprised by how “incredibly warm” she was. Maybe, she muses, “something in her writing wasn’t available to me at the time. It’s interesting to come back and confront that and to see what my way in is, because this is not just going to be an encounter with the text. I have to have a very intense encounter with Kathy Acker. That’s what the Wooster Group is all about: when we take on a project we have to investigate the whole ethos of the writer.”Does she feel afraid? “That’s the big question,” she laughs, snapping shut her laptop. “I almost said no to this, and there’s a huge risk of failure. But I only feel fear when I’m not working. As soon as I get in the space I don’t worry, because you just have to deal with what’s really happening.” And besides, she says as we head back down past the flickering screens, “this is a fabulous situation. It’s like the exhibition has done half of the dramaturgy for us.”• Desire: an encounter with a play by Kathy Acker is at the ICA theatre, London, 31 July-4 August, as part of I, I, I, I, I, I, I Kathy Acker.

Can there really be a right – or wrong – way to enjoy your favourite malt?It can often seem as if there are only two schools of thought when it comes to how you should enjoy your whisky. Some treat the drink with an almost austere reverence, insisting that it should only be taken neat or with just a touch of water – maybe, at a pinch, with an ice cube or two. Others, which in reality means most people who enjoy a tipple every now and then, are happy to mix it to taste with whatever works for them, use it as a base for a cocktail, or simply sip it from a mighty tumbler towering with ice.But is there a right way to drink whisky? It might be that you can do whatever you want with the house blend down at your local pub, but what about something more refined – in other words, what about a single malt?For the uninitiated, the distinction between a blend and a single malt is a fairly easy one to mark out. A scotch blend is simply a mixture of grain and malt whiskies from two or more distilleries. A single malt, on the other hand, is nothing more and nothing less than a whisky from a single distillery, bottled and sold as a whisky from a single distillery.But, of course, things are always a little more complicated than that. Blends are sometimes thought to be inferior to their single malt cousins, and while this is by no means a settled question, it is true that they don’t quite inspire the same scholarly devotion as single malts. So, while plenty of whisky purists may have no problem with you topping up an inexpensive blend with a yard of Coke, they’re likely to take a less charitable view of you doing the same with their favourite malt.Luckily, there is an answer to all of this.“It really just depends on what you’re looking for,” says Kirstie McCallum, senior blender at Distell International, which owns and produces Tobermory. “For me there’s a real difference between wanting to sit there and appreciate a whisky for all its flavours and complexity, and just actually wanting to sit there and enjoy a drink with friends.“If I want to appreciate all the flavours in a whisky and appreciate that maturation and the work that’s gone into it I love it with just a wee touch of water to open it up,” she says. “Then just sip it, let it rest in your mouth a bit so that you get a proper chance to take in all of the flavours. At the same time, if you’re just sitting around having a drink with your friends, do whatever you want with it.”McCallum’s refreshingly unpretentious take is rooted in her view that whisky – and that includes single malts – is on the whole a social, relaxed drink. That means there is plenty of room at the table both for those who want to contemplate their whisky – either neat or, as she prefers it, with a touch of water – and those who want to let their hair down a bit more.“I think for too long whisky has been seen as kind of standoffish,” she says. “There’s always been this view of whisky that it’s maybe a bit like how people see wine – they worry about not knowing what to ask for or about getting it wrong somehow. But whisky shouldn’t be like that at all, because it’s a drink for everybody.“We make the whisky for people to drink it, and whatever you like adding to it, as long as you enjoy it that’s how you should drink it,” says McCallum. “The great thing is that whisky is just such a versatile drink. You can do cocktails with whisky, you can do long drinks, or you can have a nice single malt with water.”With that in mind, McCallum suggests a number of tantalising options for enjoying Tobermory 12 Year Old. “I think with Tobermory being such a citrusy, caramelly, kind of sweet whisky, it mixes well with something that’s nice and light and fresh,” she says.“It works really well as a long mixed drink with lots of ice. I’d recommend trying it that way with either ginger ale or some fresh apple juice,” she says.On the cocktail front, McCallum says that the citrus and caramel notes of Tobermory 12 Year Old are particularly complemented by berry flavours – so a Scotch bramble, or perhaps a malt old fashioned with a blueberry garnish, could be well worth trying.“For me, whisky is a very personal drink,” she says. “I drink my whisky and it’s about memories of being places and being with friends – it’s not about ‘you can’t do this and you can’t do that’. In the end, it’s about enjoying it on your own terms – do whatever you want with it.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/103d7edb918046d27211514c4b0c8c65181c1521/77_1046_3951_2370/master/3951.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b84f7e3ec7414a27e2ddef745b420f77","title":"north carolina islands beauty outer banks dunes","story":"The remote, pristine islands of North Carolina are rich with dunes, wildlife – and the ghost of BlackbeardThere is no horizon: only the odd hint indicates what is water and what is sky. A dolphin shows its back, just for a second. A pair of oystercatchers draw two cursive Ms against the blue. Otherwise, the water of the Pamlico Sound is so still, and the silence so complete, it’s a disembodying experience. Slick cam, they call it.From his kayak, Bob Chestnut could reach down into the shallows and pluck out any number of treasures. Through the water he can see the dark ragged outline of oyster clusters, a shimmering of scallop shells and mussels pre-opened by the birds. In the summer, families come out here with long rakes to dig for clams.The Outer Banks – a narrow chain of barrier islands off the east coast of the US that separates the Atlantic from the mainland – are no secret to Southerners. Their 100-mile stretch of beach, running from Corolla in the north to Cape Lookout in the south, is a vacation magnet for families and spring breakers alike, as well as a pilgrimage for sporting types who can kite surf or land big game fish in the warm Gulf Stream waters. And while the Banks can claim no town with a population larger than 3,000, they still have a rich human history, inhabited by the Roanoke and Croatan people until the arrival of English settlers in the 1500s – not to mention the site of the Wright Brothers’ first powered flight.It’s not always this quiet in Ocracoke. The weather can be rough – Hurricane Florence blew in last year. And just because the North Carolinan island is hard to get to – three hours’ drive from Raleigh, followed by an hour’s ferry ride – it doesn’t mean people don’t try. A new passenger ferry from Cape Hatteras has recently been announced, because the queue for cars can be up to three hours in summer. But the locals don’t resent the visitors, says Chestnut. “The people we get tend to be the people who appreciate it.”Roanoke island boasts the quaint and well-heeled town of Manteo, complete with a yachting marina and Elizabethan garden. Across the Oregon Inlet – by way of a couple of epic bridges – are Nags Head, Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills, seaside towns with connecting shorelines stacked with stilted beach houses. Keep driving south to Hatteras island, across the newly constructed Bonner bridge, and you are rewarded with 70 miles of protected seashore. With the blessing of the islanders, the Hatteras shoreline was designated a national park in the 1930s and today its meeting of beach, marshland and maritime forest is a haven for wading birds, water mammals and more. “I’m anti-regulation in general,” says Chestnut, candidly. “But we have a better relationship with the park service than most.” Which is why on Hatteras and Ocracoke you are free to drive your 4WD vehicles across the golden sands, knowing that the nesting turtle population is well protected. And why while some come here to spot seals and harbour porpoises and snowy owls, others come to shoot ducks, or go flounder gigging – spearing flatfish in the shallow waters, a skill learned from the Native Americans who once used this place as a hunting ground.The islanders of the Outer Banks have always treasured their freedom. The waters surrounding them – known as the graveyard of the Atlantic, because their ever-shifting shoals are so perilous to shipping – were once a hideout for pirates and privateers. Edward Teach, aka Blackbeard, was killed (and then beheaded) while at anchor on Ocracoke. The island’s brewery – which makes an unexpectedly tasty oyster stout from the local catch – is named 1718, after the year of his capture.Still accessible only by boat – from Hatteras to the north, or Cedar Island to the west – Ocracoke’s past has been preserved by its remoteness. “Nobody stumbles across Ocracoke,” says Chester Lynn, whose ancestors have been here for 10 generations. “I can remember the days when you had to take three ferries to get to the mainland.” Lynn sells antiques out of every room of his single-storey family home and, as one of the older residents, still speaks with the brogue that is part of the island’s Elizabethan legacy – an accent closer to northern England than the American South.The community spirit, too, has been preserved. In the cafes and restaurants regulars talk across tables, sharing stories of their day and asking after friends. The buildings themselves are a glimpse of the island’s 1930s heyday, when it was a thriving fishing community and pilot town, helping trading ships to transfer their goods across the treacherous sounds on lighters.Back then, “Jack’s store” was the place locals gathered to collect their mail and their gossip that it’s still standing is no surprise. Make-good-and-mend is central to the island culture. Among the quirkiest results of that attitude are the tiny, walled cemetery plots where the island’s chief families have buried their relatives.“The problem has always been that the water table is so high it was hard to keep people buried,” says Amy Howard, who runs the Village Craftsmen store. “A good flood could pop up a casket.” Her family traces itself back to William Howard, Blackbeard’s quartermaster. “Luckily for him he was in jail in Virginia when the big battle happened, and he got a pardon,” she says.Some locals claim to have seen phantom pirates out at Springer’s Point, the site of Blackbeard’s last battle but visitors can have their own haunting experience with a boat ride to Portsmouth island, just a couple of miles away. Abandoned by humans in the 1970s, it is now a compellingly eerie ghost village, and tour guides like Wade Austin – whose father was a ferry captain – still have living memories of Henry Pigott and Marian Babb, the last man and woman to live there.Austin has travelled the world, but nothing would tempt him from Ocracoke. “I’m not much of the city to begin with. I saw the world, and I came back. It’s what most people here do.”• Wayfaring Stranger: a Musical Journey in the American South by Emma John is published by W\u0026ampN (£16.99).

Controversy over the deal forced the resignation earlier this month of the US labor secretary, Alex Acosta, who was US attorney in Miami at the time.The order is only one of several signals that prosecutors plan to widen their investigation into what they allege was a years-long scheme to recruit and sexually abuse dozens of girls.Epstein, denied bail and remaining in custody pending trial, has pleaded not guilty to federal sex-trafficking charges. He is on suicide watch in a Manhattan detention facility, after being found unconscious with marks on his neck.On Friday, it was revealed that pilots of Epstein’s private jets, including a Boeing 727 that carried high-profile friends to and from his home in the Virgin Islands, have been served with subpoenas.According to court filings, the pilots were responsible for keeping flight logs of passengers on the jets. Their testimony could be used by prosecutors to corroborate accusers’ accounts and provide details of Epstein associates.Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, who was named in a civil suit brought by Epstein accuser Victoria Giuffre in 2003, are regularly named among associates of Epstein.Clinton has denied flying with the financier as many as 26 times, as has been reported, although he did say he took “a total of four trips” with him in 2002 and 2003.In a statement, the former president said he “knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York”.Buckingham Palace has repeatedly denied the accusations against Prince Andrew.In 2015, Giuffre brought a defamation suit against Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, for publicly calling Giuffre a liar after she claimed Maxwell participated with Epstein in sexually abusing her for two years starting in 2000, when she was 16 years old.This month, Maxwell, who has long denied allegations that she played a central role in the procuring of young women, told a three-judge panel in New York a media “feeding frenzy” justified keeping documents from the defamation suit secret.But Josh Schiller, one of Giuffre’s lawyers, argued: “There is an overwhelming public interest both in getting access to these documents as well as the indictment of Mr Epstein and his prosecution.”The judicial panel agreed. As soon as next week, 2,000 pages of documents relating to that case, which was settled in 2017, will be made public.In its ruling, the panel said the documents included descriptions of alleged abuse by Epstein and other iniduals “including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known prime minister, and other world leaders”.In April, Giuffre filed a defamation suit against the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, Epstein’s longtime lawyer and friend, after he denied her claim that he abused her.The shockwaves from Epstein’s arrest on 6 July could travel further still. Central to the mystery of his operations is how he acquired his wealth, which was listed at his bail hearing as more than $550m.Last week, Deutsche Bank confirmed that Epstein moved millions of dollars through dozens of private accounts. Executives said they had believed they had severed the relationship with Epstein but had discovered accounts still controlled by him as recently as June.“Deutsche Bank is closely examining any business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and we are absolutely committed to cooperating with all relevant authorities,” a spokesman said.Authorities in Florida, meanwhile, have launched an investigation into whether Epstein was properly monitored during the 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution from underage girls that was the product of the controversial 2008 deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4440ffcd6c94dc3d6249264d623cae5063253a7e/0_115_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52b318d0ecafe1b3e101112cd1b7d4d8","title":"morbidly sensible adulting no way getting life insurance is empowering","story":"Does the thought of tackling life insurance send you into a slumber? Here’s why it could be worth giving it another shot …TV, takeaways and, erm, life insurance – I know which I’d rather commit to tonight when I get home. Admittedly, insurance isn’t exactly the sexiest of weeknight propositions, so it’s hardly any wonder so many of us choose to bury our heads in the proverbial sand when it comes to facing it. But before you fall into a slumber deeper than Snow White on a hangover, let me tell you why it might be worth giving it five minutes of your time (it won’t take any longer than that, promise).You see, life insurance is one of those things that makes perfect sense on paper - the kind of task you wonder why you didn’t get round to sorting once you realise what it actually involves (before swiftly ignoring it again for another six months, if you’re anything like me). I mean, think about it, how many important things have you taken the time to insure in your lifetime? I can name several - a car, the odd holiday, my home and a smartphone (or six). So why is it we’re neglecting to insure the most important thing of all?A quick straw poll of my friends reveals the many reasons we don’t. Some figure that not having children, a partner, or owning a home, means they don’t need it – they reason there’s no point spending money on something they don’t actually need yet. But if either of those things could plausibly happen in the near future, it might be worth planning ahead (after all, you’ll have more pressing things to worry about once any #wedmin kicks in, and doing it sooner likely means lower monthly payments, too). It’s also worth asking whether any dependants or loved ones would be financially stable without you, since life insurance could take care of that (something not many of us like to think about, granted).Life insurance could also be very useful for anybody jointly responsible for mortgage payments. What happens if one person dies before the mortgage is paid (nope, not a fun discussion but an important one)? Experts flag that we shouldn’t assume death-in-service cover or life insurance via your employer means we don’t need to worry about life insurance, either, unfortunately. While useful, workplace cover tends to pay out benefits as a multiple of salary (eg four-years’ salary) to ensure your family has cash available to make up for the loss of your salary to maintain their lifestyle it may not cover any large financial commitments, such as a mortgage.What are the available options? Well, Aviva offers three types of life insurance: cover that remains the same, and so do the payments cover and premiums that increase over time and cover that decreases.For the latter, the value of the cover goes down each month, but your regular payments stay the same. People usually use this product to cover a repayment mortgage, which also decreases.If you’re looking to help cover your salary and maintain loved ones’ living standards or to settle your mortgage and provide reassurance – then you may want to go for the same level, or increasing if you want some protection against the effects of inflation. Still with me? Good.The best part is there’s minimal legwork – most customers could get a quote and decision in just over five minutes (reading this is probably the most arduous part, sorry) and it might be cheaper than you think, with policies starting at around £5 a month. So we could all start protecting our loved ones immediately.Pretty awesome, right? And probably much smarter than putting it off until your next birthday, and spending more when we do bite the bullet (since policies tend to get more expensive the older you are). Making that decision suddenly feels like a no-brainer to me – what about you? Then we can all get back to that boxset and tikka masala …For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf6d882003f288fe71fb8e290c0aabe2a8009c1/0_166_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d0a797aefa752860073bd8b0980f56e","title":"mussolini birthplace cashes in on rise far right tourism","story":"Dressed in black T-shirts, their arms inked with tattoos, Fabrizio and Mameli Gamberini are on their yearly homage trip to Predappio, the birth town and burial place of Benito Mussolini.“We’re fascists,” Mameli proudly admits as she leaves Predappio Tricolore, a souvenir shop teeming with Mussolini memorabilia, on Friday morning. “We come every year at the end of July to buy a few new keepsakes, visit his tomb and leave some flowers in his honour.”The couple, from Varese, are in Predappio, a town nestled among the hills of the Appenines in the Emilia-Romagna region, to celebrate the 136th anniversary of the Italian dictator’s birth on 29 July.It is one of three occasions over the past two years, including the anniversary of his death on 28 April and the march on Rome on 28 October, that the Mussolini family crypt has been opened to the public since it was closed for restoration works in 2017.The anniversaries have always attracted thousands of fascist pilgrims from across Italy and beyond, who join a parade that leads to the tiny San Cassiano cemetery, where they pay tribute to Il Duce (The Leader) with a fascist salute, leaving messages of admiration in the guest book. A card attached to a bunch of flowers left recently said: “Thank you, Duce”.The Gamberinis are now thrilled to learn that they might again be able to pay their respects on any day of the year after the town’s recently elected rightwing mayor, Roberto Canali, last week announced controversial plans to reopen the crypt all year round as a way to boost tourism.Most residents in this town of about 6,000 accept the influx of fascists on the anniversaries as a necessary evil as they are the most fruitful days of the year for shops, bars and hotels, hence the reason why there has been little criticism locally of Canali’s plans.In fact his pledge, which has been supported by Mussolini’s granddaughters, Rachele and Alessandra, was an election campaign winner.“After the tomb was closed, so many businesses complained about the loss of custom,” Canali told the Observer. “Apart from those three intense days a year, we get a continuous flow of people who, dressed normally, come out of curiosity or to understand history, but who are disappointed to find the tomb closed.”Claudia Brunazzi, a representative from the local business association, Albero Rosso, said: “It’s a pity that Predappio is only remembered for this, as there is so much more – the wine, food, scenery – but ... opening the tomb is useful for business.”Needless to say, Canali’s plans triggered a sharp rebuke from Italy’s anti-fascist association, ANPI, which is planning to protest on Sunday (the day the crypt will be open).“This muddies the memories of the many victims of fascist crime, its racial laws and collaboration with the Nazis that led to the massacre of innocent women, men and children,” the association said in a statement.Luca Capacci, a spokesperson for Possibile, a small leftwing party, said: “It’s very sad and worrying that the opening of the tomb is seen as an attractive element in a territory that has much more to offer. It’s not a historic monument like the Colosseum … the people who go there do so to celebrate a dictator.”It is unclear when the tomb, whose opening to the public is at the behest of the Mussolini family, would be opened permanently, as town leaders still need to work out who will foot the €30,000-a-year bill for it to be guarded and maintained – the town or the family. One of the reasons it hasn’t been reopened since restoration works was because the previous custodian, a devout Mussolini fan, did the job for free for years.Nostalgic factions of the Italian population have long helped keep the spirit of Mussolini alive, but thriving rightwing populism has been further dismantling the taboo. Matteo Salvini, deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League, sometimes quotes Mussolini, and during a European election campaign rally in Forlì, close to Predappio, he addressed a crowd from the same balcony where the dictator watched his opponents being killed.Mussolini and his mistress, Clara Petacci, were shot dead by partisans in the final days of the second world war before their bodies were strung up at a filling station in a Milan square. His remains were brought to Predappio in 1957.One of the reasons his spirit lingers is because some Italians consider him to be the country’s last “strongman” leader, who not only restored law and order but who built better housing, roads, transport systems and schools, while also investing in industry and introducing a welfare system.People such as the Gamberinis still struggle to square up to his misdeeds. “It’s thanks to Mussolini that we have pensions,” said Mameli. “His main mistake was siding with Hitler – and he paid for it.”Canali is unable to provide official data on how many people visit Predappio, which was rebuilt on Mussolini’s orders in the 1920s, each year past estimates suggest 100,000. But without doubt, the town also pulls in a steady flow of people who come simply out of curiosity.Last October a week-long history tour of Italy, called “Duce! The Rise and Fall of Italian Fascism” and organised by a British firm, Historical Trips, sold out. Rachele Mussolini met the group on the Predappio leg of the trip to answer questions about her grandfather’s legacy.Other than the cemetery, people can wander around the house in which he was born.“It’s incredible that this place even exists,” said Pieter Floore, an archaeologist from the Netherlands who stopped in Predappio with his family on Friday morning as they made their way home from a holiday in the nearby Marche region.The rightwing surge across Italy helped to end more than 70 years of leftwing rule in Predappio upon Canali’s election in late May. Canali ran on an independent civil list, but was strongly backed by the small far-right party, Brothers of Italy, to which Rachele belongs.Unable to stop people coming to the town, whether out of intrigue or nostalgia, former mayor Giorgio Frassineti is still endeavouring to open a museum aimed at teaching people about Italy’s dark period, rather than glorifying it. Frassineti also fought to close the souvenir shops selling fascist paraphernalia during his time as mayor. Up until a few years ago the town had three or four shops. Only Predappio Tricolore, which sells everything from black shirts and fez hats to Mussolini busts, mugs, calendars and even baby clothes featuring one of his famous quotes – “who dares wins” – remains open today.The owner, Pierluigi Pompiglioni, was in a jovial mood as he poured red wine from a bottle emblazoned with Mussolini’s image for the keen customers who dropped by on Friday. Locals joke that Pompiglioni is Predappio’s richest man, having enjoyed a brisk trade for years.“But for the last couple, due to the tomb being closed, business has been bad,” he complained. He doesn’t see anything wrong in selling merchandise that celebrates fascism. “Fascism is dead, Mussolini is dead – those who buy these things are just rightwing people who want political change.”Others beg to differ.“If we think fascism is only about wearing a black T-shirt or a fez, we are very much mistaken,” said Capacci. “Mussolini may be dead but the ideology he created is not completely dead, as is demonstrated every day in the news and politics, not only in Italy.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dissident republicans used viable device in attempt to murder police officersTrainee teacher was carrying black satchel-type \u0026lsquoCAT\u0026rsquo bag when she was last seen 21 years agoChristian Brothers and Scouting Ireland are understood to be each paying half of the settlement costActor Pauline McLynn calls for sport to be outlawed at Dublin demonstrationPublic advised not to drink two types of water from shop chainsThieves believed to have cut Eir cables before stealing up to \u0026euro10,000 in cash and cigarettesRoyal Jordanian Falcons headline opening day during weekend of flying acrobaticsTramore native Jim Swift (37) undertook record-breaking feat to raise money for hospiceThe row is believed to have broken out at Hogan Place, near the National Maternity HospitalSammy Wilson reacts angrily to Simon Coveney\u0026rsquos criticism of UK Brexit policyDry, sunny weather coming but night-time temperatures to dipDUP describes as \u0026lsquounhelpful\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoaggressive\u0026rsquo Taoiseach\u0026rsquos comments on stability of unionBroken lifts and unstaffed stations among reasons for lack of accessibility, group saysSpecialist British-based insurers reluctant to quote for business in Ireland, operators sayChair of expert group warns Government against moves that \u0026lsquonormalise\u0026rsquo drug useA contentious agm will decide if the organisation\u0027s president is elected for another termResidential Tenancies Board concerned over \u0026lsquosignificant reduction\u0026rsquo in supplySeamus Walsh (38), from Co Kilkenny, is killed on a highway in New South Wales"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3969808.1564314676!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain operating on assumption of no deal brexit says gove","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove: Simply presenting Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement to parliament again would ‘not be enough’. Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergThe UK government is “operating on the assumption” that Britain will leave the EU without a deal on October 31st, Michael Gove has said.Mr Gove, who is in charge of no-deal preparations in the Cabinet Office, said there was a “very real prospect” that an agreement would not be struck with Brussels before the Halloween deadline.Writing in The Sunday Times, he said that while the aim was still to leave with a deal, the Government needed to prepare for every eventuality.“With a new prime minister, a new government, and a new clarity of mission, we will exit the EU on October 31st. No ifs. No buts. No more delay. Brexit is happening,” he said.“The EU’s leaders have, so far, said they will not change their approach — it’s the unreformed withdrawal agreement, take it or leave it,” he added.“We still hope they will change their minds, but we must operate on the assumption that they will not.”Mr Gove said the British government would do “everything in our power” to secure a good deal for the UK, but said simply presenting Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement to parliament again would not be enough.“You can’t just reheat the dish that’s been sent back and expect that will make it more palatable,” he wrote.Planning for no deal was now a “number one priority”, he said, as the paper reported that Mr Johnson had put together a “war cabinet” of six key ministers to deliver Brexit by October 31st “by any means necessary”.Chancellor Sajid Javid has said there will be “significant extra funding” this week to get Britain “fully ready to leave” the EU on October 31st, with or without a deal.The additional spending will include financing one of the country’s “biggest ever public information campaigns” to ensure iniduals and businesses are ready for a no-deal exit, Mr Javid told the Sunday .“Under my leadership, the Treasury will have new priorities and will play its full role in helping to deliver Brexit,” he said.“In my first day in office as Chancellor, I tasked officials to urgently identify where more money needs to be invested to get Britain fully ready to leave on October 31st — deal or no deal.”InfrastructureHe added that he planned to fund 500 new border force officers and look at new infrastructure around the country’s ports to minimise congestion and ensure goods can flow.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said she will back Boris Johnson as prime minister, but will not give her support to no-deal Brexit.Ms Davidson insisted that her position in the Scottish parliament exists independently of Westminster and that she does not have to sign any no-deal pledge to continue to serve.“When I was debating against the pro-Brexit side in 2016, I don’t remember anybody saying we should crash out of the EU with no arrangements in place to help maintain the vital trade that flows uninterrupted between Britain and the European Union, Ms Davidson said in the Mail on Sunday.“I don’t think the UK Government should pursue a no-deal Brexit, and if it comes to it, I won’t support it.Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn has said he is “not in the slightest” bit worried about going up against Boris Johnson in a general election.The Labour leader said the party has most candidates selected in marginal constituencies and a “summer campaign plan” is in place.Mr Corbyn said Labour also has many policy announcements ready.Speaking on Sky’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday, Mr Corbyn said he will do everything he can to stop no-deal Brexit: “We will do everything to challenge this Government, and we will do it at a time of our choosing.”Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said he was working on a cross-party alliance to prevent a no-deal Brexit.He told The Observer: “The political direction of travel under Boris Johnson is clear, and so it is more important than ever that we build a strong cross-party alliance to stop a no-deal Brexit.“That work will intensify over the summer, before parliament resumes in September.”Meanwhile, polls have suggested the Tories were boosted by a “Boris bounce” after the election of their new leader.Since Mr Johnson became Prime Minister after being declared party chief by Tory members, the Conservatives have gained 10 points to stand at 30 per cent, a survey by Deltapoll for the Mail on Sunday showed.That puts them five points ahead of Labour at 25 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent and the Brexit Party on 14 per cent.But if Labour was to drop Jeremy Corbyn as leader, the poll says the party would shoot into the lead at 34 per cent, with the Tories on 28 per cent, the Brexit Party on 14 per cent and the Lib Dems on 13 per cent.The poll came as Mr Johnson set out an eye-catching domestic stall promising a £3.6 billion boost for left-behind towns.He also pledged funding for a new rail link between Manchester and Leeds and promised action on housing and crime, despite insisting he was not preparing for a snap autumn election.– PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

She is derided by the far left for her pragmatism, despite being a long-time target for Republicans. Photograph: Getty I, the daughter of a DC cop, and Carl, the son of an Illinois plumber, were hilariously painted as decadent aristocrats revelling like Marie Antoinette when we should have been knitting like Madame Defarge. Yo, proletariat: If the Democratic Party is going to be against chocolate, high heels, parties and fun, you’ve lost me.And I’ve got some bad news for you about 2020. The progressives are the modern Puritans. The Massachusetts Bay Colony is alive and well on the Potomac and Twitter. They eviscerate their natural allies for not being pure enough while placing all their hopes in a colour-inside-the-lines lifelong Republican prosecutor appointed by Ronald Reagan. The politics of purism makes people stupid. And nasty. My father stayed up all night the night Harry Truman was elected because he was so excited. I would like to stay up ’til dawn the night a Democrat wins next year because I’m so excited to see the moment when the despicable Donald Trump lumbers into a Marine helicopter and flies away for good.But Democrats are making that dream ever more distant because they are using their time knifing one another and those who want to be on their side instead of playing it smart. House Democrats forced Robert Mueller to testify, after he made it clear that he was spent and had nothing to add to his damning yet damnably legalistic, double-negative report, because they were hoping the hearings would jump-start howls for impeachment.But it’s hard to get the mad blood stirring with Muellerisms like “This is outside my purview” “I can’t get into that” “I don’t subscribe necessarily to your – the way you analyse that” and “I’m not going to go into the ins and outs.” I never want to hear about the “OLC opinion” again. The Republicans were impressively craven and hypocritical. They are sticking with Trump, and no pallid reminder of his turpitude, his trellis of obstructions and his unpatriotic embrace of foreign interference in our elections will change that.The always blockheaded Texas representative Louie Gohmert shouldn’t even be allowed to hold the coat of Mueller, a war hero and respected public official. But Gohmert yelled such crazy stuff at the former special counsel that he appeared to be auditioning for a spot on Fox News’ The Five.The hearings were shameful for Republicans thirsting for re-election and a failure for Democrats thirsting for impeachment. It was many underwhelming hours of members of Congress reading to Mueller and Mueller saying, Yes, that’s what I wrote. Or at least what somebody wrote.The recipe for emotional satisfaction on the part of the progressive left is not a recipe for removing Trump from the White House. The argument about whether Trump is impeachable is the wrong argument. Mueller settled that. We know Trump did things worthy of impeachment. That is not the question we should be asking. The question is: should he be impeached? The progressive Puritans think we must honour the US constitution and go for it because it’s the right thing to do. You can argue that impeachment, morally and constitutionally, is the right thing to do.But you also have to recognise that, historically and politically, it is not the right thing to do because it will lead to disaster. The attempt to impeach Trump is one of the rare cases in which something obviously justified is obviously stupid. Unbelievably, Pelosi – long a GOP target for her unalloyed liberalism – is derided by the far left for her pragmatism. But she has been through enough Washington wars to know that idealism, untempered by realism, is dangerous. An impeachment could return Trump to power. The highchair king from Fifth Avenue would exult in his victimhood and energise his always-ready-to-be aggrieved followers. It could also lead to Democrats losing the House as their moderates fall and help Republicans hold the Senate. No Republicans would vote for impeaching Trump, and some Democrats might refuse as well. Even if the House acted, Mitch McConnell would smother it in the Senate, just like he did Merrick Garland.It’s better to pull out Trump by the roots in the election and firmly repudiate him. The Democrats should focus on the future, not the benighted past that we have been relegated to under Trump. Hillary Clinton’s campaign focused on what a terrible person Trump is. It turned out that enough voters knew that and didn’t care. They wanted a racist Rottweiler. Now the Democrats are once more focused on what a terrible person Trump is.Message received, many times over.The progressives’ cry that they don’t care about the political consequences because they have a higher cause is just a purity racket. Their mantra is like that of Ferdinand I, the Holy Roman Emperor: “Fiat iustitia, et pereat mundus.” “Let justice be done, though the world perish.”The rest of us more imperfect beings don’t want the world to perish. And maybe justice can be done, without losing the White House, the House, chocolate, high heels, parties and fun."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Iran to restart activities at Arak nuclear facility, says officialGerman soldiers offered free travel in uniform to \u0026#39boost army visibility\u0026#39Jeremy Corbyn mocked for \u0026#39fanciful\u0026#39 claim he could beat Boris Johnson in election Opposition leader Alexei Navalny hospitalised for allergic reaction in Russian jailNHS hot food suppliers claim safety concerns around frozen meals in wake of listeria cases are a \u0026#39myth\u0026#39M\u0026ampS customers complain as firm\u0026#39s cafes quietly ditch free biscuit with cup of tea in bid to cut down on food wasteIndian villagers beat tiger to death after attacksHong Kong plunges into pandemonium for second day in a row as protests continueCheck your sofas! 145m old £1 coins still haven\u0026#39t been returned, Royal Mint says as it is feared millions are lostComment: As dawn breaks on November 1, what awaits the markets on the first day in no-deal Britain?British woman who alleged gang rape in Cyprus arrested on suspicion of making a false allegationSupermarkets told to shut the door as it emerges open fridges use one per cent of Britain\u0026#39s electricityAshraf Ghani\u0026#39s running-mate wounded in Kabul blast as Afghan election campaign beginsFrance to train benefit officials in detecting lies through applicants\u0026#39 facial expressionsI\u0026#39ve been subjected to more racism since Brexit than rest of my career altogether, former children\u0026#39s laureate says Mother of British schoolboy who won almost £1m at Fortnite tournament admits trying to stop him gamingTaliban deny imminent formal talks with KabulRuth Davidson tells Boris Johnson: I will not support a no-deal BrexitWhy you need a weekly dose of good news – introducing The Bright Side Comment: The People\u0026#39s Front of Extinction Rebellion points to a deeper ide within the Green causeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"best telegraph audio smartphones making us less productive green","story":"The best of The  in audioEvery Friday the  will bring you a selection of our best articles, comment pieces and features in audio form to be listened to at your convenience.Here are this week\u0027s recordings.

He had flown for 11 miles at speeds of up to 87 mph, 50 feet above the waves.Divers from the refuelling boat pulled him out of the water unhurt with his ‘Flyboard’, which he designed and built himself.Stéphane Denis, a member of Mr Zapata’s support team, said: “It is a huge disappointment. He made his rendez-vous with the refuelling boat, but the landing platform touched his ‘Flyboard’. That threw him off balance and he fell into the water.” Mr Denis added that he would make another attempt, probably within weeks.  It took him 10 minutes to reach the boat and if he had managed to strap on a new fuel pack and lift off again, he would have expected to reach St Margaret’s Bay, near Dover, in another 10 minutes. It would have been the first Channel crossing on a hoverboard.Franky Zapata stands on his jet-powered \u0026#39flyboard\u0026#39 as he takes off from Sangatte, northern FranceMr Zapata, a former jet-ski champion from Marseille, was reportedly furious at the failure. He blamed French maritime authorities who had refused to allow him to refuel in mid-air. He had wanted to refuel twice, once over French waters and another over UK waters.British authorities did not oppose the plan, but the French deemed it too dangerous. French commentators said the French refused because they were more concerned about safety, while the “Anglo-Saxons” were more relaxed, provided other people were not put at risk.  Mr Zapata, nicknamed “Flyman” by French media, had planned the attempt to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the first cross-Channel flight by Louis Blériot, the French aviation pioneer.During an early test flight when he was developing the turbo-powered ‘Flyboard’, two of his fingers were torn off after he collided with a wall and caught his hand in the turbines.He delighted French leaders by soaring over their heads at the Bastille Day military parade in Paris. Emmanuel Macron, the president, compared him to James Bond.

Jaden, 15, will share £1.8m with his playing partnerA British teenager who won almost £1 million at a gaming tournament said he is happy to have shown his mother that he was not just wasting time in his bedroom.Jaden Ashman will split £1.8 million with his Dutch playing partner after the pair came second in the first Fortnite World Cup.The 15-year-old from Essex competed under the name Wolfiez at the three-day event held inside the Arthur Ashe tennis stadium in New York.More than 100 finalists were set to take part in the event\u0027s various competitions, having been whittled down from around 40 million who attempted to qualify for the tournament and compete for the £2.4 million top prize.More than 30 countries were expected to be represented at the finals, which featured a duo competition for pairs and a creative tournament where teams of four aim to complete different in-game trials.The online battle royale game has become a popular culture sensation since its launch two years ago - more than 250 million people have played the game, and its in-game celebratory dance moves have been re-created by some of the world\u0027s biggest sports stars.Jaden told the BBC: Me and my mum, we clash quite a lot. She didn\u0027t understand how it worked, so she thought that I was spending eight hours a day in my room just wasting my time.So now that I\u0027ve proved to her that I can do stuff, I\u0027m really happy.His mother, Lisa Dallman, told the BBC: If I\u0027m honest with you I\u0027ve been quite against him gaming. I\u0027ve been more pushing him to his schoolwork.I\u0027ve actually thrown an XBox out, snapped a headset. And then leading up to the games, getting his visa, we had problems with that so we had a week of a nightmare.Then the dog ate his birth certificate. And then my work messed up my wages, so three things went wrong before we started heading here so I knew we were on an even keel and everything was going to go right.Asked about the prize money, Ms Dallman said: I think Jaden\u0027s not really a materialistic person. He will have a lifetime supply of Uber Eats, and I think that will do him, to be fair.Just sitting there playing video games and eating takeaways, Jaden would be in his element.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

These are favoured by supermarkets because it means customers are able to grab products quickly.However, they have been criticised by campaigners and MPs as a massive waste of energy and money which are contributing to global warming.A study carried out with the support of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found that retail food outlets are responsible for around three per cent of total electrical energy consumption.It added that refrigeration systems account for between 30 per cent and 60 per cent of energy used.Most shops use open fridges, which use far more energy to stay cool than alternatives with doors Mary Creagh MP, who is the chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, told The : It\u0027s a terrible waste of money and some stores have introduced closing doors.From next April all companies of a certain size have to declare their greenhouse gas footprint, so this should spur them into measuring their gas bills and trying to work out ways to reduce them.A Friends of the Earth spokesperson added: “With the world in the midst of a climate emergency our shops and stores should make it a top priority to save energy and slash the emissions that are roasting the planet.“Supermarkets must ensure that their fridges and appliances operate to the highest energy efficient standards – and if they won’t, the government should make them.”Campaigners argue that supermarkets could cut their energy use by a quarter if they simply put doors on fridges. Many retailers have fitted their open fridges with energy-saving technology, but environmentalists say further savings could be made if doors were installed.Now, almost 25,000 people have signed a Parliament petition urging MPs to force supermarkets to use fridge doors.The petition states: Retailers in the United Kingdom unnecessarily waste huge amounts of energy on open fridges and freezers. Climate change threatens our planet. If all supermarkets had doors on their fridges and freezers it would save energy the equivalent of the entire residential population of Poland.Everyday food items sold in plastic packaging - zero waste puffThe campaign was started by brother and sister Jonathan and Gem Golding, from Brighton.Apparently this could inhibit shoppers though? Dunno about you but think I\u0027d still get my Ben and Jerry\u0027s.In France, supermarkets have signed up to a voluntary agreement to put doors on three-quarters of their 450 miles of fridge aisles by 2020.So why is no one else taking action?Her brother, 28, told the Mail on Sunday: I happened to be in a restaurant and they had given me a plastic knife and fork, so I was in an environmentally conscious mood. In the corner of my eye I saw a fridge and it was open, and I just thought that couldn\u0027t be very environmentally friendly.I think people are very happy to sacrifice convenience for the environment and that is the same with plastic as well.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said in a statement: The Government is taking action to improve product energy efficiency. Our minimum performance standards remove inefficient products from the market, and labelling raises awareness of the best ones.Minimum energy performance standards, otherwise known as Ecodesign regulations, are technology neutral so do not prescribe that manufacturers should increase efficiency by putting doors on appliances.Rather they set a minimum energy efficiency limit that all manufacturers placing products on the market must meet.The legislation therefore leaves it up to the manufacturer as to how they meet the requirements, which could include but is not restricted to putting doors on fridges, the statement read.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

To clarify, those negotiations will occur after we conclude our own agreements.”Taliban envoys are due to meet US negotiators in the coming daysSuch talks would take place between militant leaders and a broad negotiating team of “senior government officials, key political party representatives, civil society and women”.The Taliban have long refused formal talks with Ashraf Ghani\u0027s administration, deriding it as an America puppet government. Kabul officials met the insurgent envoys in Doha earlier this month to try to break the ice, but attended in a “personal capacity”.Zabihullah Mujahid, Taliban spokesman, said there has been no agreement on such a meeting and that has not been coordinated with Taliban.Mr Ghani\u0027s government has been sidelined for the past year as America and the Taliban have repeatedly met in Doha. Their talks are set to overshadowing campaigning for September\u0027s presidential elections. As the two-month campaign began, Mr Ghani told a rally “Peace is coming and the negotiations will take place”.America and the Taliban have tried to come up with a deal whereby US troops withdraw from their 18-year-campaign, while the Taliban guarantee that Afghanistan would not become a launchpad for international terrorism.The two sides have so far been unable to agree on a timetable for withdrawal, with the Taliban wanting US troops out in a matter of months, and the US wanting a longer withdrawal based on whether a peace deal sticks.

The 64-year-old embodies everything we love to celebrate about British entrepreneurialism and commerce. And it’s a story like hers that would provide welcome relief from the tales of misconduct and poor governance – of arrogance and greed – which these days seem to dominate the business pages.McDonough’s biopic would be about ambition, hard work and a healthy dose of risk. But above all it would be about humble success: few jewellers can claim to have their pieces in the permanent collection of London’s Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum. Even fewer can say that their designs are favoured by several generations of royals. But almost none would be able to tell you all that without sounding even just a little bit boastful. This charming mother of two from Battersea is one of the few.On a muggy Friday morning in June, I meet McDonough in the basement of her eponymous flagship store, just off London’s chic Sloane Square. The term “basement” really doesn’t do the space justice. Carpeted in soft pastels, and with a huge sofa covered in cushions, the light and breezy room is a seamless extension of the shop upstairs, decor-wise. It serves as an atelier-cum-office-cum-lounge for McDonough’s team, and as I take a seat I can’t help but feel like I’ve been invited over to a very stylish, very classy friend’s house for tea.\u0026nbspMcDonough is a fifth-generation jeweller and her immaculate taste and eye for all things beautiful could have been inherited from either of her parents. Her father owned an antique jewellery shop off Bond Street and prior to having children her mother ran fashion shows at Paris’ Galeries Lafayette. Initially, though, McDonough didn’t seem destined for a creative career. After completing her A-levels at Queen’s Gate School in Kensington, where – she casually drops into conversation – she was taught English by Eliza Manningham-Buller, who later served as director general of MI5, she attended secretarial college\u0026nbspand took an admin job in the offices of Vogue.“I did what girls my age were doing at the time. But it was in the 1980s that I had what I call my lucky break,” she explains, sipping her coffee, long legs elegantly crossed at the ankles, and smiling at the memory a little coyly.Kiki McDonough on Symons Street at this year’s Chelsea in Bloom, London’s largest free flower festival in London (Matt AlexanderPA WirePA Images)“A friend of mine had an antique jewellery shop on Grafton Street in Mayfair. He called me up one day out of the blue and asked if I wanted to design and sell modern jewellery for him. I thought it was a totally mad idea, but my then-husband, David, encouraged me to give it a go.”And so, in 1985, Kiki McDonough the company was incorporated. In the founder’s own words, her first baby was born. With no design experience, she sat at her desk on day one, staring at a blank piece of paper with a pencil in hand. “I was clueless. The only thought going through my head was that this is completely bonkers,” she says with a laugh. But as it turns out, it wasn’t really as crazy as she suspected.\u0026nbspGavanGetty)The first pair of earnings McDonough ever designed – crystal hearts topped with gold bows – were inspired by an antique brooch she’d spotted in her friend’s collection. They now have pride of place in the permanent collection at the V\u0026ampA, and even though they were created some 34 years ago, their style is echoed in many subsequent collections, including those that have caught the eye of royals.In the mid-1990s, Diana, Princess of Wales, wore a pair of McDonough’s earrings to meet Barbara Bush. Over the last decade, scores of glossies have vied for snapshots of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, in McDonough’s creations. In March, the Express splashed a story claiming that the Duchess has over £47,000 worth of jewellery from the brand. But ever the professional businesswoman, exuding poise and grace, McDonough is not about to be roused such reports, accurate or not.\u0026nbsp“Of course it’s flattering that she likes my pieces, but what really gives me pleasure is when I walk down the street and pass someone wearing one of my items,” she says. “That unexpectedness – that’s what really gets me out of bed in the morning.”Our conversation mid-flow, I suddenly get distracted by an elderly lady in a striking suede coat with dazzling blue earrings who’s quietly entered the room and is now shuffling past us. I quizzically look at McDonough. “This is my mother,” she says with a touch of pride. “She’s 95 and quite deaf, but she works for me one day a week stringing necklaces. She’s always supported me. In 1989 she took over the shop when I had chickenpox.”From everything that I’ve seen and heard, there’s no doubt that while McDonough success is obviously her own doing, support from her friends and family has been paramount to her ability to stay resilient and devoted despite the testing ups and downs of running a company.Of course it’s flattering that she likes my pieces, but what really gives me pleasure is when I walk down the street and pass someone wearing one of my items. That unexpectedness – that’s what really gets me out of bed in the morningThough neither of her sons, now aged 25 and 27, work in the industry, she says that from a very young age she made sure that they understood what she did, and appreciated that it was her hard work that allowed them to lead a comfortable life. She also speaks fondly of both her ex-husbands and describes how fortunate she was to have found partners that understood and promoted her passion.\u0026nbspThe business has just had its most successful year ever and as questioning turns to the future, McDonough says she’s confident that she can continue to expand in the years to come. Beyond her Chelsea shop, she distributes through some of the best-known department stores, including Fortnum \u0026amp Mason in London, and Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus in the US. But it’s online where she sees the greatest potential for growth. Though the UK remains her dominant market, about 35 per cent of sales already go to the US and the brand has a strong following in Canada, Australia and Asia, predominantly because of the internet.\u0026nbspHer international resonance and success might be at least partly attributable to the variety of her collections. Many of her pieces are elegantly understated with intricate florals and delicate pastel hues – “jewellery for everyday”, as she calls it – but others are show-stopping, unapologetic statement features in radiant greens, reds and blues.That spectrum means that she’s loved by women of all demographics and backgrounds, seeking jewellery for all\u0026nbspoccasions. And while prices are certainly not cheap, it’s always been the business’s mission to make beautiful, high quality products available at a price point that’s affordable to as many as possible. Prices currently range from a few hundred pounds to several thousand.Why women don’t need a science degree to be successfulSpotify for textbooks: Inside the revolutionary new book shopAs the interview draws to a close, I can’t help but mention a delicate gold bracelet that I’d seen some months ago and then spotted again on my way downstairs to meet McDonough. “Oh yes, I know the one you mean. It would really suit you.” Of course she’d say that.\u0026nbspA few minutes later – my wallet a little lighter – I step out into a now sun-drenched Sloane Square admiring my birthday present to myself and silently vowing not to make a habit of bringing my credit card to interviews with jewellery designers in future.\u0026nbspBut Kiki McDonough’s charm really did win me over. There might’ve been a more economical way of finding whether she’s a good saleswoman too, but a little indulgence is sometimes necessary.

Its kit can be found in just about every Airbus jet, for example.\u0026nbspFootasylum could run a lot faster under JD’s wing after £90m takeoverCobham hit by US defence spending cutsAdvent’s offer represents a 34 per cent premium over Wednesday’s closing share price, and it looks like a shoo-in to get the 75 per cent support from shareholders that\u0026nbspit requires for the deal to go through.The premium looks like a tasty one, and the majority of its investors will likely sign up in a heartbeat.\u0026nbspFor a start, the board has backed it unanimously, as has Artemis, one of\u0026nbspits bigger institutional shareholders. While the company has found its feet of late, its recent history has not been entirely happy. It issued a string of profit warnings between 2015 and 2017. In the last of those years it tapped shareholders for an emergency £500m to help with a debt-mountain built up in part through a botched acquisition.\u0026nbspThe new shares, issued through the cash call, were priced at 75p. Investors who signed up and held on to them are getting 165p in cash from Advent. Cha-ching.\u0026nbspCould Cobham have got there on its own, though? The shares were at a higher level than that as recently as the beginning of 2016. It might seem like a tall order given Britain’s desperate political climate, but the question is rarely asked even when things are going well. The rule in the City is you take the money and run when it’s offered. \u0026nbspAnother rarely raised question, unless the company involved is a big household name, is whether the deal is a good one for this country.\u0026nbspIn the case of Cobham, the government may not even need to lie about this being an investment in Britain that shows off its vim.\u0026nbspAdvent has surely been assisted by the climate that government has created. Its behaviour has so tarnished Sterling that shares denominated in the UK’s currency are unnaturally cheap for overseas bidders, which can therefore afford to make their offers look generous.\u0026nbspWith the requirement to act like a good little vassal of the US, any muted objections to the deal will fall on deaf ears. There’ll be no question of using the slightly beefed up powers the government has to halt takeovers involving sensitive companies like this one.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

He pointed out that the sharp fall in sales recorded in the June survey was at odds with a healthy rise in sales subsequently reported by government statisticians.However, the factors that have supported consumer spending this year may be starting to fade, he said. He pointed to a recent slowdown in employment growth and evidence from surveys that pay rises are running out of steam.In addition, with UK consumers saving a very low share of their income, they may “at the very least” want to stop dipping into their savings, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, he said.“Meanwhile, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit,” he added.The CBI survey was conducted between 27 June and 16 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018After the deal, Intel will retain the right to develop modems for non-smartphone applications, such as PCs, industrial equipment and self-driving cars.New iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakModem chips connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks, but Apple has always relied on outside suppliers for the part. Intel has positioned itself as the sole source of iPhone modem chips over the past year after Apple got into a prolonged legal fight with previous supplier Qualcomm over patent licensing practices.Apple, based in\u0026nbspCupertino, California,\u0026nbspreached a surprise settlement in April that called for the iPhone to once again use Qualcomm modem chips. Within hours, Intel said it would quit the smartphone modem business.Apple’s acquisitions have mostly been much smaller companies, making the Intel deal its second-largest ever after its $3.2bn purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014.The deal with Intel will bolster Apple’s goal to make its own modem chip. Two of Apple’s biggest global rivals – Samsung Electronics and Huawei – already have the ability to self-supply modem chips.Technology news publication The Information last year reported Apple’s efforts to develop its own modem, but the iPhone maker\u0026nbspnever formally acknowledged it. In February, Reuters reported that Apple moved its modem engineering efforts into the same chip design unit that makes the custom processors for its devices, signalling a doubling down on the pursuit of self-designed modem chip.Apple chief executive Tim Cook has also long said the company wants to control its own technological fate – analysts call this\u0026nbspthe “Cook Doctrine”.“We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make,” Tim Cook told investors back in 2009.The purchase of Intel’s assets could help Apple meet its aggressive timeline for producing a modem.A person familiar with the matter said Apple plans to use Qualcomm’s modem technology for a 5G iPhone in 2020 but wants to have its own ready for use\u0026nbspby 2021.But any replacement of Qualcomm is likely to happen in phases, this person said, as Apple builds up its ability to ensure that its modems work on all the networks and countries where it sells phones. Ensuring worldwide compatibility is Qualcomm’s historical strength, and Apple might still have to rely on the firm\u0026nbspfor some modems during a transition period to its own devices.“There’s a fierce desire (at Apple) to have independence, but they also realise it has to be done responsibly,” this person said.Apple’s licence deal with Qualcomm lasts six years and its accompanying chip supply agreement could also last that long, said one chip industry veteran who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Apple is likely to continue to use the San Diego firm’s chips in its flagship models even if it phases in its own silicon for lower-end and older models, this person said.Apple has engaged with Taiwan’s Global Unichip Corp, a chip design house in which Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is an investor, to explore a modem design, but the work is in early stages.“Clearly Apple saw the handwriting on the wall, because they came around and did a deal with Qualcomm,” this person said.Apple declined to comment on its plans, and Qualcomm and Global Unichip did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The most valuable aspect of the Intel deal for Apple could turn out to be patents. To sell a 5G iPhone, Apple will need to strike deals with the major holders of 5G patents, including Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei and Qualcomm. Apple executed a licensing deal with Qualcomm, but it has not disclosed whether it has deals in place with the others.Erick Robinson, a patent attorney who had worked in Qualcomm’s licensing ision in Asia, said the patents could give Apple better leverage in licensing talks.“I don’t think Intel has quite the portfolio that Qualcomm has, but they certainly have a large enough one to impact the valuations when it comes to a cross-licensing deal,” he said. “It’ll save (Apple) a huge chunk of change in cross-licence deals.”Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Another flame flew out of the top of the rocket, as can be seen on the video.The rocket itself appeared to survive without problems, but it is just the latest in a run of issues. It came a week after the Starhopper craft flew a fireball out of its bottom during another test.It was the first time that SpaceX has allowed one of the tests to be streamed.

Next time, send an emailOn Saturday, Mr Arnold said Mr O’Mara had asked him to stay on until a new MP takes the Sheffield Hallam seat.Mr Arnold said: “From 3 September, he’ll be resigning, triggering a by-election.”He added: “He’s going, there will be a by-election and a new MP before the end of the year.”Mr O’Mara’s announcement that he will resign as MP comes after allegations that he sexually harassed a former employee.However Mr Arnold said he had already made the decision to resign.Mr O’Mara took the Sheffield Hallam seat for Labour from former deputy prime minister and former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg in 2017.He had the whip withdrawn after apparently sexist and homophobic comments emerged, which he had posted on social media years earlier, but was readmitted to the party after receiving a formal warning.Mr O’Mara resigned from Labour in 2018, saying he had been “made unfairly to feel like a criminal”, and now sits as an independent.The Independent has approached Mr O’Mara for comment.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The overall decline marks the longest period of falling sales since 2011.“Despite the recent pick-up we’ve seen in households’ real earnings, the sun is clearly not shining on the British high street,” said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, which represents British businesses.Strong growth in grocers’ sales was outweighed by steep falls at department stores, clothing retailers and other shops.Another measure, which strips out seasonal variations in sales, also pointed to weakness: a balance of -20 per cent of retailers said sales were good for the time of year.\u0026nbspCompared with recent lows, firms expect\u0026nbspa slight pick-up in their fortunes in August, predicting sales will be broadly flat on a year ago.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson waves as he enters 10 Downing Street following his appointment as Prime Minster by the Queen.

He pointed out that the sharp fall in sales recorded in the June survey was at odds with a healthy rise in sales subsequently reported by government statisticians.However, the factors that have supported consumer spending this year may be starting to fade, he said. He pointed to a recent slowdown in employment growth and evidence from surveys that pay rises are running out of steam.In addition, with UK consumers saving a very low share of their income, they may “at the very least” want to stop dipping into their savings, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, he said.“Meanwhile, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit,” he added.The CBI survey was conducted between 27 June and 16 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We are pinning our hopes on the ongoing diplomatic efforts. So far the Iranian\u0026nbspauthorities have given the crew no\u0026nbspindication about a release, he added.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHis son said the crew were really terrified when the Iranian security forces first\u0026nbspapproached the boat and took control of the vessel.He said they came in helicopters and seized the ship. After the initial panic, the crew understood that they have been taken into custody and will not be harmed in any way.They are all doing fine and appear to be being treated well by Iranian authorities. He said several Iranian\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspwere on the vessel and all crew members were allowed to talk to their family members for a few minutes.”\u0026nbspThe Stena Impero was detained\u0026nbspalong with 23 crew members who are of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality.The shipping company released a statement on Thursday saying: Stena Bulk and Northern Marine Management continue to hold dialogue with all the governments and authorities directly involved in order to secure the release of crew and vessel.We await a decision from the local authorities on our request to attend the vessel,” it added.The news came as a report from Iran\u0027s semi-official Tasnim news agency claimed the UK sent a mediator to the country to discuss the freeing of the tanker, but this was later denied by senior foreign office sources.\u0026nbspOn Wednesday, Iran\u0027s president, Hassan Rouhani, suggested that Stena Impero could be released if Britain takes similar steps to hand back an Iranian oil tanker seized by the Royal Navy off Gibraltar earlier this month.Crew of British oil tanker captured by Iran are \u0027safe\u0027Iran rejects UK proposal for international maritime coalitionThe Iran crisis leaves the UK in a precarious positionJeremy Hunt announces joint European task force to protect UK shipsPompeo says ‘responsibility falls to UK to take care of its ships’The British Department for Transport announced on Thursday that it would be offering Royal Navy escort for British-flagged ships travelling through the strategic water way.\u0026nbspMr Pappachan said Dijo had only joined the boat from Gujarat, western India, a month before it was seized, and had little idea about the dangers of operating in the Strait of Hormuz.\u0026nbspThe family found out the\u0026nbspvessel had been taken when they received\u0026nbspa phone call from the Swedish company that owns the tanker.\u0026nbspIt was completely unexpected that his ship will be seized.

What they want us to do is deliver on their mandate, come out of the EU on October .In recent weeks there had been speculation that the new Conservative leader could take the country to the polls in a bid to consolidate his power base.If a snap election is called, Boris will battle it out to retain his title as PM - it would be a chance for him to understand how confident the British public are in his skills, as his current position as PM was voted for by members of the conservative party.A  General Election could see some big changes to the Conservative party, as it looks like Tories may have to accept the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, and back that in Boris campaign.Johnson would run against Jeremy Corbyn, who lost out to Theresa May in  with  per cent of the UKs vote.However, voices from within and outside the Labour party are allegedly urging Corbyn to quit as Labour experiences record slumps in polls in the wake of several anti-antisemitism scandals.A number of Labour MPs have been rumoured to be gunning to take over from Corbyn in Labours leadership, most notably Londons Mayor Sadiq Khan.Jo Swinson, who took over Lib Dem leadership this month would also run -

In other words, both the No Deal preparation and the proposed deal must be realistic.This is where his key Brexit lieutenants Dominic Cummings and David Frost come in.They might be backroom appointments but they are as —not more — important to the success of Boris’s premiership as the Cabinet appointments he has made.Cummings is a unique figure in Westminster. He is interested in getting things done with little regard to what people think of him and the political niceties.It is thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch that Cummings has attracted something close to celebrity status in political circles. Cumberbatch played Cummings in the TV drama Brexit: The Uncivil War.He captured brilliantly Cummings’ drive and determination to win as the campaign chief for Vote Leave, and the fact he doesn’t care whose ego he ruffles in the process.In his new job, Cummings’ determination is already clear.Yesterday he was meant to be on the operating table under general anaesthetic.But once the offer came from Boris, he cancelled the operation. I am told he won’t have it done now until after October , Boris’s deadline for getting Brexit done.Cummings came in because the chance of getting the Vote Leave team back together to deliver Brexit after three years of drt simply had to be taken. The big challenge for this team is to get the UK ready for a No Deal Brexit.Cummings is well suited to his task. He knows how Whitehall works and how to succeed despite intense opposition he drove through Michael Gove’s Free Schools, which have proved hugely successful, against the objections of the educational establishment.Strikingly, in Boris’s new Government it is now Gove who is in charge of the No Deal planning.Getting the logistics and the necessary contingency plans sorted is one aspect of No Deal planning, and one that was shamefully neglected under Mrs May. But there also needs to be a political strategy for it.Many in the EU are convinced — thanks to the antics of Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond and co — that Parliament will block No Deal.Or thatthe UK did leave without a deal on Halloween, it would come crawling back by Christmas.So they reckon there is no need to compromise as No Deal either won’t happen or will be only a temporary affair.The best way to deal with both the Parliamentary opposition to No Deal and the belief that the UK would come crawling back is for Boris to take a lead in the polls.If it was clear that a general election would lead to a majority for Boris, then Parliament would be less likely to throw obstacles in his way.That’s why Boris, in his Downing Street speech, tried to address the issues that cost the Tories their majority in : Social care, schools funding and police cuts.If the EU thought that Boris could do No Deal, and could politically sustain it, then it would have to decide whether it was prepared to compromise to avoid No Deal.The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, would have to decide whether it is worth sticking with a backstop that is going to cause the very thing it was meant to avoid, a hard border on the island of Ireland.Varadkar would also have to consider whether he really wants to go through with No Deal when it would do more damage to the Irish economy than the UK’s. This is where David Frost comes in.No, not the late, great TV personality but the former Foreign Office diplomat who is going to be Boris’s point man for negotiations with the EU.Frost knows his way round the chancelleries of Europe, he is a former Foreign Office Europe Director and he also knows what Boris wants on Brexit.He was his special adviser when Boris was Foreign Secretary and was there when Boris decided to quit over Mrs May’s Chequers plan.His role is to craft a Brexit agreement that delivers what Boris thinks the UK needs AND one that has a chance of being accepted by the EUthe alternative is No Deal. This isn’t going to be easy, and it isn’t going to be done quickly.Those involved admit thatthe EU is going to blink, it will not be until the October EU Council at the earliest, which is just two weeks away from the October  deadline. As one of those working in the new No puts it: “Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride.”But after years in which the EU thought they had the measure of the British Prime Minister, we now have a team who might just have what it takes to pull Brexit back from the brink. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There, they can enrol in a course on gender studies and emerge in three years with a degree which will not help them one bit to get a decent job.And as a consequence they will be at least £, in debt. But they’ll have a piece of paper which will tell possible employers: “Look — I’ve been a total mug for three years. Gizza job!”The unemployment rate for students at Britain’s worst universities, such as East London and London South Bank, is around about double the national rate for young people.In other words, going to university worsened their chances of getting a job.That’s not what they were led to believe, is it. They were told a university degree would open doors for them. Not slam the doors shut in their spotty faces. And leave them with a whopping loan to pay off.Our young people have been conned for far too long.We have a new Prime Minister now. And I think it would be a good ideahe took a very close look at higher education. OK, he’s got Brexit to sort out first, fine. But by November , this should be his priority.We are misleading our young people. Far too many -year-olds go to university and end up mired in debt, with rotten degrees in stupid subjects. While all students have to scrimp and save to get through their three years.Here’s what I would doI were Education Secretary.End all tuition fees right now. Make university education absolutely free, and make sure those who go get decent living grants.How do we pay for that  Easy. Cut the number of people going to university by  per cent. Not everyone is academically minded. University should be only for those who are.Back when I went to uni only ten per cent of my peer group got in.But for the rest there were apprenticeships. Learning in the workplace. And those sorts of options should be considered not inferior to university, but absolutely equal. And the benefits stressed to the kids.Three years after leaving school a university kid will be earning nothing. If you’ve been on an apprenticeship for three years you’ll be earning a decent whack.We have over-stressed the importance and attraction of a college education to our young people, given them unrealistic expectations and made them pay through the nose for it. And at the same time we’ve devalued education by doing this.So there’s the challenge, Boris. Get on to the private sector and get some more apprenticeships up and running.And close down the awful former polytechnics charging a king’s ransom for a crap degree.ONE of the best things about BoJo becoming Prime Minister is that the perpetually screeching Yasmin Alibhai-Brown has vowed to leave the country.Brown loathes the white English working class.So it was always a mystery to me why she stayed in the country. Seeing as there are quite a lot of white, English, working-class people.Anyway, she vowed to get the hell outJohnson became PM.Trouble is, people say stuff like this but rarely act on it.I suggest we set up a crowdfunding page for her plane ticket and maybe throw in some extra money for en-route snacks and stuff.Off you go to Heathrow, Yazza.I MADE a list a few weeks ago about the  things I most dislike in the world.At No was Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals.At No was Taylor Swt.And No was cats .So take a guess as to what new film I’m not going to be watching any time soon It’s my nightmare, all wrapped up in two hours.CARL BEECH made a series of outrageous claims of sexual abuse, torture and murder by members of the old Conservative establishment.This serial liar and fantasist will soon be sentenced for his crimes.The reason the police believed this madman is because they have been told they must. They are no longer allowed to employ common sense.In order to be politically correct they have had to shed all semblance of judgment.THE job of a bookshop, you would have thought, is to sell books.Trouble is, they are useless at it. They are politically biased and cater solely to a tiny minority of gibbering liberals.I’ve got a book out at the moment, called The Great Betrayal – The True Story Of Brexit. I’ve had complaints from people who want to read it that they can’t find it in bookshops.The bookshop staff say they thought there wouldn’t be any interest in it. But it was the No best-seller in the country and was No on Amazon worldwide. It’s pure political bias.If you want the book – go on Amazon.TOP prize in the “Most Rational and Measured Response to Boris Johnson Becoming Prime Minister” goes to – of course – .For this headline: “The Clown Is Crowned As The Country Burns In Hell.”Followed by , words of hysterical drivel.Brilliant. The Left really don’t like it when they don’t get their own way.Anyway, this is but the first example of BDS – Boris Derangement Syndrome. Don’t worry. Lots more of it to come.MAGIC grandpa has a cunning plan!The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced to the Press that he was going to “surprise Boris Johnson” by calling a vote of no confidence.Here’s a tip, you Jew-bothering, bearded c**kwomble.If you want something to be a surprise for someone, don’t tell every newspaper in the country.THE Islamist crackpots in Iran have hijacked two of our oil tankers.

They truly believed that those of us who voted to leave the European Union were all thick, racist bigots.There was never any real attempt to change the minds of the .million. There were only sneers, jeers and smears — and the full might of the British establishment committed to stop Brexit from ever happening.Brexit — a true Brexit — has not always seemed inevitable. There have been times over the past few years when the EU looked like the Hotel Calornia, where you can check out but you can never leave.But in the end, it did not matter what they wanted — the elite, the ones with power, the pampered factions of the British establishment, who are totally accustomed to getting their way.Because once the British people had made their democratic decision, Brexit was ALWAYS going to happen in the end.It is more than three years since the nation decided to leave the European Union.But it is only a matter of days that we have had a Prime Minister who actually believes in Brexit.Boris has electried Britain with his vision of a bright, shining future for our country outside of the  rotting EU empire.My heart says Prime Minister Johnson will get Brexit done. So do the bookies.He will probably need a General Election before Christmas to shake up the Parliamentary numbers, but Boris will make it happen.ButBoris can’t do it, then somebody  will make Brexit happen.Brexit is bigger than Boris.

And democracy still matters here.Democracy is deep in the British DNA, far deeper than in all those European nations where they have the national memory of a jackboot resting on their throats, far deeper than in all those countries where they have been invaded, occupied and tormented by tyrants.That is why the British establishment, in the end, could not veto Brexit. Sorry, chaps, you can’t dial down democracy. You can’t cancel the will of the people. Not in THIS country.The people decidedIn the end, democracy would not be denied. They could not reverse, overrule or cancel a referendum result in a country that has not been invaded for one thousand years.The will of the establishment — all those ex-Prime Ministers, all those well-heeled big shots, all those Right Honourable members and ermine-clad Lords, all those BBC executives, all those crisp sellers and ex-members of the Boomtown Rats — did not matter more than the will of the people.There is a historical inevitability about this country leaving the EU because, quite simply, it is what the people decided.And no matter what the establishment may believe, the people in this country are not their servants.Our great country is a democracy.Now and for ever, the people are the masters.And that makes Brexit unstoppable.NEW Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson wants a second referendum  but admits she would still campaign to keep the UK in the EU evenwe voted to leave yet again.Oh Jo.

He then took his own le eight years later.Given that one in  of the population identies as gay, this doesn’t exactly seem representative.And that’s probably why @FootballerGay’s account racked up so much support so quickly.The account’s profile said the player was a “proud gay man”. He posted numerous tweets saying his club had been informed of his decision to come out and had been supportive. He tweeted saying that on July  he would reveal his identity.But instead, the account was deleted a couple of days ago. And shortly before that, the bio on the account was changed to read: “I thought I was strong enough. I’m not.”Although his tweets had messages of support from people such as Gary Lineker, lots of other people doubted the authenticity of the account.That includes my husband, an ex professional footballer.His view is that these days no one, from other players to the club, would caresomeone were gay.He should know. He played with Justin Fashanu and says no one in the dressing room had a problem with Justin being gay and he wasn’t treated any dferently to anyone .Still, outside the dressing room, he was singled out.Just one example is the time the owner of the opposing team called him a faggot from the sidelines.Fashanusprinted towards this guy, who got so scared he locked himself in the Press box.Fashanu kicked the door down to find the guy pleading, crying and denying he said anything. Justin could look after himself. But that kind of thing took its toll.Although we’ve moved on since , hearing stories such as that does make you realise why some footballers might think twice about coming out.I don’t carethe Twitter account was real or not. After all, who someone sleeps with is none of my business. Butsomeone wants to come out to the world, it is a terrible state of affairshe thinks he needs to be strong and “brave” to do so.And the reality is that attitudes towards a lot of things have changed over the past couple of decades.I remember when I turned up at the Director’s Box of an away game when I first took over at Birmingham City Football Club in .When I asked where the boardroom was I was told that director’s wives go in the ladies room. When I mentioned that I was the managing director the old boy on the desk put his glasses on, looked at me and said: “Oh yes, you’re that woman . . . stay here and I will find out what to do with you.”Because, at that point, women where banned from entering the boardrooms.That was the first door I ever kicked down. So I know in a very small way how being the first and being dferent to everyone  in football feels.Nowadays I am proud to say there are so many talented women running clubs. And I like to think we have moved on enough that no one would bat an eyelid at a gay footballer.Still, the football world can be a fairly intolerant place for anyone who is anything close to a minority.Maybe it’s the case that until we create a tolerant, accepting environment and culture then footballers won’t feel safe enough to come out.But which will comes first: that . . . or, someone like this being brave enough to admit they are gay and face the possible backlash.Only time will tell.And what I’d really like to see is a football culture in which someone’s sexual orientation really is neither here nor there.DID anyone  wince looking at the photo of the man intercepting his girlfriend’s moment of glory when she was being awarded her degree – to drop down on one knee and propose I guess Edgaras Averbuchas saw it as a romantic gesture but to the onlooker it was just a bit, well, selfish.For a start it looked like he couldn’t bear to let Agne Banuskeviciute have her moment in the sun so muscled in. He attempted to eclipse her huge achievement and make it all about him.Plus, he put her in a very dficult position. I mean, whatAgne wanted to say no Why didn’t he just let her graduate and then ask her in the evening to marry him But also, Agne wasn’t the only person graduating that day – I wonder how everyone  felt about having their big day overshadowed by this big “romantic” gesture Sorry to say that this does not bode well for the relationship.And my advice to this young woman would be to run while you still have the chance and find someone content to allow you to be successful in your own right.[boxout featured-image introI LOVED reading about Mackenzie O’Neill, the -year-old from Canterbury, Kent, who found himself having a bit of a kickabout with Lionel Messi on a Caribbean beach – the stuff that dreams are made of for some kids.]This is the kind of memory that never goes away, but it’s not only children that live for a moment like this. My husband, himself a professional footballer, played on the beach with Diego Maradona about five years agoand he still can’t stop talking about it.[ boxout]KEVIN CASH, once hailed as one of Britain’s most successful property tycoons with a fortune of £million, was declared bankrupt last July with debts of £million.So it is no surprise that he and fourth we Carla are now going to have to make a few changes to their lives.But when you hear that they used to spend £,-a-month on groceries and “housekeeping”, it becomes clear how hard it might be for them to get used to bankruptcy and shopping, presumably, at Lidl.What on earth are they buying  Gold bars to eat Now they’ll be shopping in the bargain bin.As Arsene Wenger used to say about Arsenal’s performances: “One day caviar, and the next cabbage.”WHATEVER you think about Theresa May, no one could deny that she is driven by a sense of duty to the country.So it’s no surprise that she has shed a tear once or twice over the past couple of very dficult months of dashed hopes and disappointments.But what has struck me when she’s been caught crying on camera is how quick people seem to be to triumph over what they see as a sign of weakness.Meanwhile,a man in a position of responsibility is seen to show emotion or shed a tear, he is seen as admirable, noble and passionate.I mean, it’s one thing wearing one in bed, it’s another thing altogether wearing it in bed with a new girlfriend.But to do so on national TV Well, all I can say is, I hope he wasn’t in his socks as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But former Chancellor Philip Hammond has warned against squandering any extra money in public coffers. Meanwhile its understood that a cross-party group of MPs are already plotting how to prevent one.

Insiders say that with a slim majority, Mr Johnson will struggle to get legislation through.And with Brexit looming, Mrs May’s ­influence on the backbenches will be crucial.Mr Johnson killed off her deal this week and said the UK was prepared to leave without one.    And, in a move that infuriated her inner circle, he pressed for the backstop to be scrapped. Sources say she is making plans to set traps for the new leader. Her first step was consolidating her power base. Hours after leaving Downing Street, she watched England’s cricketers with two of her since-sacked ministers, David Gauke and Greg Clark, and ex-chief of staff Gavin Barwell. Earlier, Mrs May was spotted wearing a gold pebble bracelet that bore a striking resemblance to one that belonged to Mrs Thatcher.    This prompted speculation she had been the secret bidder at an auction in May. One Whitehall source said: “May might have bought ­Thatcher’s bracelet but she also plans to copy what she did when she stood down. “She’s going to bring together all her former Cabinet ministers. She’ll plot and give them orders. “They threaten a guerilla war against Boris. She’s angry and will get even.” As she left No Mrs May said she hoped for a Brexit “that works for the whole United Kingdom” – a remark seen as a message to her successor. The replacement of her Cabinet with hardline Brexiteers has given Mrs May a taste for revenge, insiders say.  Within hours of the new PM taking over,  full Cabinet ministers and four others who attended Cabinet were sacked or resigned. The clear-out included many of her old guard. International trade ­secretary Liam Fox and Greg Clark, the business secretary, left their roles, as did ­education secretary Damian Hinds, and James Brokenshire, the housing and communities secretary. Sources say Mr Johnson’s strategy was a gamble – and he is relying on outgoing ministers staying loyal.  One insider said: “They’ve fired people who they think will vote for the Government’s deal on Brexit. That’s why you’ve seen strange people brought in – they had to be bought off. “There are loads of people Mrs May gave positions to. They owe her.” If, as expected, the Tories lose the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election on Thursday to the Liberal ­Democrats, the Government’s working majority will fall from two to one. It will be the smallest of any PM since John Major. The insider added: “Can you imagine getting anything through ” Mrs Thatcher fell out with Mr Major over his handling of the economy just weeks after she resigned as PM. They had a row in January  over interest rates and she was furious about his plan to abandon the poll tax. Brutal reshuffle strategist is real power at No Leave campaign architect Dominic Cummings is believed to have pulled the strings on Boris ­Johnson’s brutal cabinet cull. The reshuffle, dubbed the Night of the Blond Knives, was the bloodiest many in Westminster remember as the new PM dished senior posts out to hardline Brexiteers. From the outside, it looked like a shambles. But those in the know say it was a highly efficient operation and unelected official Mr Cummings is now the real power in Downing Street.

Nevertheless, Carol took Katie to the GP, who advised rest and pain relief.Her leg looked fine, apart from a slight graze on her shin.But when Katie’s knee continued to hurt, they went back and this time Katie was sent for an x-ray.    ‘The radiologist took a long time and took lots of dferent pictures, so I started to wonder what was wrong,’ remembers Carol.‘When they told us to make an urgent doctor’s appointment for the next day, we began to worry.’ Carol’s husband Grant, , went with Katie to the appointment the following day.The doctor told her to wait outside the room, and delivered devastating news – there was a dark shadow on Katie’s knee, and doctors believed it may be cancer. After that, things moved quickly.Katie saw a surgeon that very afternoon, and was booked in for a biopsy the following week.‘We decided not to tell Katie at this stage, as we didn’t want to worry her, so she was quite oblivious at first – she just wanted to know what was wrong with her knee,’ says Carol.‘But she was in a lot of pain by the time she had the biopsy and was struggling to walk without crutches.’ A week after the biopsy, the family were given the terrible news that Katie had osteosarcoma, a rare type of bone cancer.‘Telling my little girl she had cancer was the worst moment of my le,’ says Carol.‘Her first reaction was, “Just get it out.”‘Later we found out that she messaged one of her friends and said she thought she was going to die.’    Katie started chemotherapy.‘In the oncology ward, we saw patients walking around with no hair, and Katie worried about the same happening to her,’ says Carol. ‘Seeing how ill the other children looked – with feeding tubes and wires trailing from them – opened our eyes to what Katie was about to go through.‘We wondered how we were going to cope.’ Katie became ill very quickly.Her hair fell out in clumps, so she got her hair cut into a bob.Doctors came up with a treatment plan that involved Katie having a large part of her shin removed and replaced with a special metal bar that could be ened as she grew. It was a high-risk operation, but the family tried their hardest to remain positive for Katie.The day of the surgery came around, but just  minutes before Katie was due to go in, doctors halted the operation with grave new concerns. Punishing treatment A biopsy found that the cancer had spread to her thighs, hips and spine.‘They told us she only had a % chance of survival,’ says Carol. ‘It felt completely unreal.‘Doctors upped the chemo dose because we were fighting a losing battle – I told them to do whatever they needed to do to get Katie through this cancer. ‘It was really gruelling.‘Katie’s mouth and throat ulcers were so bad she could barely drink.‘I told herI could take all the pain away and switch places with her I would – she just said, “But you can’t, Mum.”’ Carol and Grant made the tough decision to keep the seriousness of the prognosis from their daughter, because they were worried it would be too much for her to cope with.But unbeknown to them, Katie had found out from a nurse just how ill she was – and heartbreakingly kept it a secret that she knew. The best gt Katie began a punishing new round of chemo that lasted several months. Just before Christmas, she had a full body scan to check on her progress.‘The oncologist came running in to see us and gave us incredible news – the cancer had retreated from her spine and hips!’ says Carol. ‘Although it was still present in her shin and thigh, this meant an operation was now possible. ‘To be told that she had a chance of survival just before Christmas was the best gt imaginable.’ The over-the-moon family had their best ever festive season together, knowing that Katie would be able to have a le-saving operation in the new year.  In February, just before her th birthday, Katie underwent an eight-hour rotationplasty operation to remove the cancer from her leg.Katie was the first patient to have the complex operation at the children’s hospital in Edinburgh.Surgeons amputated her leg from the mid-thigh, removed the cancerous middle-section, before reattaching her calf and foot, rotated at  degrees, so that her heel joint became a new knee.Doctors hoped this would allow Katie to continue her active lestyle much more than a traditional amputation. Amazing recovery ‘Coming round from the surgery, with so many cannulas and wires coming out of her arms was one of the toughest moments of Katie’s le,’ says Carol. ‘She didn’t have any feeling in her leg because there were nerves attached to the cancerous bone, so she had to take medication for the nerve damage and completely retrain her brain.’ But  months on, Katie is thriving.She has regular check ups and x-rays to make sure everything is healthy, but so far she’s been getting better by the day.In August, she’ll be starting secondary school, but still plans to find the time to keep up her sports, as well as volunteering for cancer charities such as Cancer Research UK. After plenty of physio, she can now walk on her prosthetic using a crutch and is even more active than ever. In fact, she’s such a good swimmer that she’s been picked for an elite squad of paraswimmers and has won gold at the Junior and Senior Scottish Disability Sport National Swimming Championships.She’s also recently started to play football and do wheelchair racing, and has been approached by the Scottish Triathlon squad. ‘She has a determination that is beyond her years,’ says Carol.‘We are proud to be her mum and dad – she’s such a resilient young child.‘When she grows up she wants to be a surgeon like the ones who saved her le.‘If not, then a Paralympian!’ ■ "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit party bus loses control","story":"NewsBrexit Party bus abandoned after losing control while out and about on campaign trailMany found the vehicles misfortune hilarious, and branded it an analogy for the deadlock facing the UKShareCommentsByBronte HowardDave Burke:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsPictures of the bus have been widely shared on social media \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Brexit Party bus came a cropper in Wales - with critics branding it a perfect analogy for the political deadlock the country is facing.

The -year-old, from Paull in Yorkshire, says she was told by the woman ‘don’t worry. We’ll make sure the place is beautul and that your mum is in beautul pictures’. Sam is one of several brides across Hull and East Yorkshire that claim they have been duped out of money they gave to a Hull wedding planner.Araminta Waldron, Kaylie Norris and Kayleigh Enderby are among those who have spoken out, Hull Live reports.   The woman at the centre of the scandal has allegedly gone missing after reports emerged that she abandoned a couple on the eve of their wedding with the pair’s big day saved by radio listeners after an appeal on radio station Stray FM.Multiple people across the country have posted on Facebook about their experience.Sam was due to get married abroad in  but after learning six weeks ago that her mother had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, she brought the wedding forward to . The mum-of-one joined numerous Facebook groups to try and snf out the best deals ahead of the big day. She came across one wedding planner allegedly offering bargains which she initially thought were “too good to be true”.    After getting in touch, messaging her and meeting the woman face to face, Sam was convinced everything was “kosher”. She says she paid more than £ to cover the cost of decorations and £ to cover the deposit for the hire of a marquee. Sam says she last spoke to her on July  before going on Facebook on Friday to find posts and comments from people who said they had been scammed. She claims she attempted to contact the woman again having heard the news but has since heard nothing and she fears she may now have lost hundreds of pounds. “I felt upset, shocked and just absolutely gutted,” Sam said. “I just couldn’t believe somebody could prey on someone’s weakness like that. “Your wedding day is supposed to be the best day of your le and I knew that mine was going to be bittersweet because although I am marrying Phil we had to bring it forward so my mum could be there. “I feel taken advantage of and I did have doubts at first and everybody said it was too good to be true but the messages from her reassured me. She kept saying ‘don’t worry. We’ll make sure the place is beautul and that your mum is in beautul pictures’. “I even said to her that I thought she was myangel and it turns out along she was doing this.”  Sam, who has reported the alleged fraud to the police and is trying to get reimbursed through her bank, said she now faces a race against time to get everything ready for the big day. “It’s going to be hard for us,” she said. “The only reason why I had that money was because I sold some puppies that my dog had had. “I only had the dress to sort out and I was supposed to be trying some on today but I’m not going now because it just doesn’t feel right. “I think she saw us coming and I think she is disgusting and vile. I hope the police find her and justice is served because she could have done this to hundreds of people and I just hope people get their money back. Kayleigh Enderby is getting married to her partner Marc Hodge in just four weeks’ time. She was convinced by a friend to go with the alleged fraudster and was encouraged to hand over £ after seeing positive reviews on her Facebook page. This covered the cost of cars, a buffet and room decorations, and Kayleigh thought everything was in hand until she looked on Facebook on Friday and realised she had been the victim of an alleged scam. “My head just went,” said the -year-old mum from north Hull. “She gave me a package for a certain amount and everything was arranged and paid for but I kept in contact and last spoke to her on July . “Then I went on Facebook yesterday and was like ‘wow – what are we going to do  We get married in four weeksapos.”  Fortunately, Kayleigh has since been reimbursed through her bank and has even tried to help out other desperate brides affected by the alleged scandal. She questioned how someone could be so “horrible” and praised friends and family for rallying round her to ensure her big day still goes ahead as planned. “We’ve got four weeks to try and do it and we will get there – we’ve got a good family backing us up,” Kayleigh said. “She isn’t going to ruin our big day. “At first I said ‘we’re going to have to cancel it’ but then my family and friends said ‘you’re not cancelling it. We will get through it’. “I just don’t know how she can be so horrible. I’m complaining about it being just four weeks away but there are brides getting married today and it’s just lucky everyone is pulling together.” Kaylie Norrie claims she knows the wedding planner as an “old family friend” and after her services were recommended she saw no reason as to why she should doubt her legitimacy. The -year-old from north Hull, who is marrying partner Sean Lane next year, said: “She told us about all these offers and I trusted her. Someone  said she wouldn’t rip us off so we got all the catering off her and made a full bank transfer. “As far as we were aware everything was booked and she sent us a receipt and when we said we needed a photographer she said she had one we could use for the day.” In total, Kaylie claims she gave her £, comprising £ for the catering and £ for the photographer, and she was planning to give her another £ this weekend.

Staff told me theyaposd never experienced anything like it and those behind the violence were confined to a cabin for the last day of the cruise, waiting for police here in Southampton.  However, PO confirmed on Sunday there was no clown on board and said this was supported by ship staff. This was confirmed by Hampshire Police. After the Britannia arrived in Southampton, a man, , and a -year-old woman, both from Chigwell, Essex, were arrested on suspicion of assault. The pair were released from custody on Sunday but remain under investigation.

At , Lucy Krogdahl was an insecure girl who felt she was a failure. She started hurting herself before developing problems with food.Inspired by unrealistic pictures on Instagram , she was hitting the gym three times a day and nibbling salad leaves.But those days are gone and Lucy, now a confident -year-old, is in the Miss England finals this week after ­being crowned Miss Lincoln.    She is putting her title to good use by raising money for charity and giving talks in schools about ­mental illness. And she has found the inner strength to show off her scars during the swimsuit round at the pageant on Wednesday. Lucy said: “I want other young women to see that you can get through the worst, that it is ­possible. I almost backed out of the swimsuit round of Miss England because I was so concerned about my scars.  “Then I started to think, ‘They are part of me and I shouldn’t hide that.’ “I don’t have anything to be ashamed of and I hope I can give that message to othersI win the title. I want people to be inspired by my story.” Lucy, of Little Chalfont, Bucks, is studying biomedical science at the University of Lincoln and wants to join the RAF as a medic.  She left school with  A grade GCSEs and three A-levels. At university she is on course for a first class honours degree. But it is this quest for perfection that left Lucy emotionally struggling aged .

I stressed around exams.” It wasn’t long before Lucy started self-harming, leaving scars on her right thigh. But things got worse when she started to measure herself against ­women she saw on social media. She said: “I was following fitness ­influencers and celebrities, especially ones who got great bodies by working out. They all looked perfect, like they led the ideal le. “In contrast I’d always been athletic looking so I started to eat less. I’d live off salad and fruit and was working out three or four times a day because I felt the need to stay fit and slim.  “I’m a dancer too, so was regularly taking part in competitions as well. The weight just fell off.” By the time Lucy was  she had dropped from a healthy nine stone to a sickly seven and a half. “I put myself under this massive strain to be all-round perfect,” she said. “But I couldn’t keep going at that rate. I felt hopeless, like I was never good enough, like my le would never be perfect. “I wanted to be the best at everything. Looking back I was doing really well but I just couldn’t see it.” Lucy’s mum Lorna, , and stepdad Mick, , were approached by someone who told them Lucy was self-harming as well as extreme dieting. She was referred to the NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and saw a counsellor at school. Within a year she stopped hurting herself and has covered up the worst of her scars with an ornate tattoo featuring a bee, lavender and peony.

And now weaposre joining in. Sam Brook works at Sainsburyaposs in Bath and realised the scheme - which supports local communities through a wide range of initiatives put forward by each store - could help make shopping a far more straightforward experience for the  million deaf or hard of hearing people in the UK. That is why Sainsburyaposs colleagues turned their Bath store into a aposSignsburyapossapos for four days earlier this month.  With the new spelling applied to the sign above the door,  colleagues from the Bath Sainsburyaposs learned how to sign several common words and phrases when interacting with customers. That meant they were able to greet anyone at the door, askthey have a Nectar Card or even discuss the weather. This video explains the whole campaign:  We were so impressed by the idea, we decided to join up with the initiative and learn some sign language ourselves. In the video at the top of the page, you can see Daily Mirror columnist Eva Simpson getting a beginneraposs guide to signing from Sainsburyaposs Jonty Parry, finding out how to sign five key phrases that should allow anyone to communicate more easily with someone deaf. The speed with which Eva was able to pick up the phrases shows how easy it is to learn just a few useful bits of sign language - and how valuable that could be when it comes to having a chat with someone who is hard of hearing. About , deaf people in the UK use British Sign Language. British Sign Language isnapost a simple duplication of spoken English. It has its own syntax and grammar, and the order is dferent.  E.g. In English, you would say ‘What is your name ’ In BSL, you would say ‘Your name what ’There isnapost a universal sign language.  There are over  recorded sign languages.For example, American Sign Language is not the same as British Sign Language.  ASL alphabet is one handed, and BSL is two handed. In fact, there are so many dferent versions of sign language across the globe, you can here see how Happy Christmas is signed in  dferent countries!   Paul Robertson, the store manager at Bath, explained that was the exact idea behind aposSignsburyapossapos. “I thought it was the perfect time to use the opportunity to explore new ways to make our store more deaf-friendly, he said. We have many hard of hearing customers in Bath and always want to make their experience as brilliant as possible, and we hope Signsbury’s will help better their time in store even more.  The in-store drive to make the hearing-impaired feel more included is just one example of many initiatives being rolled out as part of the  Days of Community scheme. All , Sainsburyaposs colleagues are being given the chance to volunteer for a cause they feel passionately about in their local community. From community fundraising to hosting events and launching their own local campaigns, they are supporting causes ranging from community gardens to sports teams and elderly care homes. When in conversation with anyone deaf or hard of hearing, there are some very simple things you can do to make things a little easier…Relax Don’t panic! SmileMake eye contactCommunicate clearly – do not cover your mouth! Use your hands – point and gestureUse pen and paper, or a voice recognition app on your phone  Move to a quiet area or turn off the TV radio other background noise "},{"url":null,"title":"saira khan madness single out","story":"NewsopinionSaira Khan: Madness to single out going it alone as a mumAmy Hart from Love Island plans to use a sperm bankshe hasnt found a man before shes  — but that wont be a walk in the parkShareCommentsBySaira Khan:,  JUL NewsopinionAmy Hart has been applauded for decision to have a child completely on her own but it is not a straightforward undertaking \"Get the biggest Daily Love Island stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWe are living in a world of choice, where women are ­encouraged to be strong, independent and  in ­control. On Loose Women this week, I met Amy Hart from Love Island. She’s , bubbly and bright. She is strong. She quit the Love Island villa on her terms. She also casually mentioned she would head to the sperm bank before she hit Mr Right had not shown up by then. Her parents support her plans. We’d been discussing fertility check-ups, as an increasing number of women are getting their oies assessed to seethey may have problems conceiving in the future. I can see the appeal. I was in my mid-s when I discovered I had endometriosis, which caused my infertility. I wish I had been able to take a fertility MoT earlier just to check everything was OK, not when I was actually trying for a baby at the age of .    But for young Amy, she wanted to use these tests to plan exactly how and when she’d have a baby and when to freeze her eggs. I found that hard to get my head around. Part of me admired her independence and applauded the freedom of choice. We live in a society whereyou don’t have a partner, you can go to a sperm bank, introduce them to your frozen eggs and make a baby. Call me old-fashioned but it was Amy’s casual choice of, “fine, I’ll do it on my own”, that did not sit right. And I told her that no one in their right mind would set out to be a single parent by choice. I have two wonderful children, Zac through IVF and Amara, who we adopted. And it is tough enough bringing up kids in a partnership.    I know from my single-parent friends and family, while they are doing an amazing job bringing up happy, healthy and adjusted children, there is a personal price to pay. And a new role model for solo parenting emerged this week, when singer and actress Natalie Imbruglia declared she was expecting her first child, aged . Natalie said she was “blessed that this is possible with the help of IVF and a sperm donor”. The Pill shook things up in the s, giving women more control over when to start a family. And now we have the science to give us even more choice. But having a baby and raising a child are two completely dferent things – and both can have major health impacts on single parents, no matter how well they have thought it through. Studies also show single parents are hit by more financial pressures and a physical and mental overload that can also affect the children.

Striker Sam Cosgrove netted a penalty in the second half, awarded for hand ball.Aberdeen face Chikhura in theleg at Pittodrie on Thursday, and up for grabs is a clash against HNK Rijeka of Croatia in the third qualying round.Ojo said: “In a game you know things like thatcan happen.“I just thought that because it wasn’t a penalty we would go and correct it.“We were dominating the game and I knew we were going to get off the pitch with a good result.”Ojo was pitched straight in from the start for his debut, having signed from Scunthorpe in a £, deal.Aberdeen beat Premiership rivals Hibs to the signature of the former PSV Eindhoven midfielder.Ojo held talks with Hibs boss Paul Heckingbottom just days before travelling up to the Granite City for discussions with Dons boss Derek McInnes.Ultimately McInnes’ sales pitch convinced the former Belgian Under- international to commit to the Dons on a three-year contract.Ojo missed the first qualying round defeat of RoPS Rovaniemi of Finland because he was signed after the UEFA deadline to register players. He was delighted to get a full  minutes of action.Ojo said: “I was happy to play and initially the plan was I would play  minutes, but I got  in. I managed to get in that extra time and we also got a decent result.”Ojo experienced European action during his time at Dutch side PSV. The midfielder admits playing at that level was a factor in signing for the Dons.He said: “I have played in Europe before and it is something I wanted to do again.“So it was a big factor in signing for Aberdeen.”Former Beerschot, Royal Antwerp, FC Dordrecht and Willem II player Ojo operated in midfield alongside Lewis Ferguson and fellow summer signing Craig Bryson for most of the game. Scotland international Bryson was named on the bench having recovered from an ankle ligament injury sustained at his former club Derby County at the end of last season.He made his debut earlier than anticipated when Taylor was taken off.Ojo said: “I am looking forward to playing with them .“This was our first game together and it is just a case of getting to know one another.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes the limit for dancer jessica","story":"Janet WestUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith Highland Games season in full fling, one talented Ardrishaig dancer scooped three first places in three dferent events last week.Eight year old Jessica McCrae, a pupil at Ardrishaig Primary, was crowned winner in the beginners section at Rosneath, Inveraray and Taynuilt Highland Games.

not with a crook in hand as the young Saint, it was to be many years later as a young man clutching St Ronanrsquos Blue Banner.The childhood dream became a reality on Friday, when he graced the stage and raised high the Blue Banner over fellow townsfolk as the Standard Bearer for .His moment in the spotlight came after outgoing Standard Bearer Jamie Boyd, ed it unsullied and untarnished to Games

My year in office has been a very eventful and enjoyable one.

Guard this Standard securely and bear yourself well that you may long retain the trust of your fellow townspeople.\"Standard Bearerrsquos Lass Caitlin Urquhart, was then called upon to invest Ronan with his sash and buss his colours.After cheers that raised the roof off the historical hall, Caitlin was presented with her Cleikum Brooch.Addressing the audience, the newly installed Standard Bearer said: \"It is a great honour for me to be chosen as Standard Bearer of my native town, which at this time celebrates the traditions associated with its history. To our Dux Boy, Aaron, who tonight keeps alive the memory of our Patron Saint, St. Ronan, I tender my congratulations and best wishes for a successful year in office.\"As Standard Bearer for , it will be my earnest endeavour to honour the memory of the founders of St. Ronanrsquos Border Games by carrying the Blue Banner of St. Ronanrsquos for the ensuing year.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this area."},{"url":null,"title":"clive-storey-s-masquerade-takes-supreme-st-boswells-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers Show took place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.The

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more. And I, along with the people of Innerleithen, head safely home after truly enchanting evening."},{"url":null,"title":"government-s-no-deal-assumption-faces-tory-labour-opposition","story":"Boris Johnson is facing Tory and Labour opposition to the Governmentrsquos assumption that Britain is now looking at a no-deal Brexit from the EU.Scottish Tory chief Ruth Davidson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have both attacked the idea of quitting the bloc without an agreement on October .The push back came as Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the Government is ldquooperating on the assumption that Britain will leave the EU without a deal.Writing in The Sunday Times, he said that while the aim was still to leave with a deal, the Government needed to prepare for every eventuality.ldquoWith a new prime minister, a new government, and a new clarity of mission, we will exit the EU on October .

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":null,"title":"county-talent-fore-fringe-sea","story":"County residents are putting on a large number of shows and workshops over the  days.North Berwickrsquos own historian and author Ailsa Fortune, who will be presenting a talk on the Elgin Marbles, said: ldquoIt is encouraging that the Fringe by the Sea organisers include local performers and authors in their programme ndash itrsquos really good for the collective morale of this vibrant community.ldquoTherersquos always a great buzz about the place when the festival is in full swing.ldquoFor me personally, appearing at Fringe by the Sea is an opportunity to share my work on some of the little-known but intriguing East Lothian characters, like Mary Nisbet of Dirleton, whose lives have influenced our national history, and Irsquom hoping the connection with the Elgin Marbles, currently the subject of international debate, will stimulate lots of interest.Ailsarsquos book, Par for the Ladies, looks at the women who shaped the golfing legacy of North Berwick.

and Daniel McCabe, all , to speak to Prestonpans Community Council about their work and the potential involvement of much younger participants.The school was recently successful in achieving its UNICEF Rights Respecting School gold award, which means that it had proved that it incorporates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into the school through both teaching and actions.It now aims to take this further and bring this ethos into the surrounding community.The children were given the chance of addressing the meeting, which included ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell and Neil Gilbert, to ask questions and discuss the best ways to engage young people with what is going on in the community and to ensure their input is noted.The children asked about the plans for the site of the former Cockenzie Power Station and whether more activities for young people such as Rainbows and Scouts could be introduced to the areaWhen addressing the councillors and community councillors, Daniel, a house captain from St Gabrielrsquos, said: ldquoItrsquos important for us at this stage to know what our future is going to hold, and to try and make a dference when and where we can.ldquoTo be involved in the community council in some way would be fantastic, as it would give us comfort to know that the community is being taken care of, as well as what decisions were being made that might affect us.It was decided that the community council would send the agenda for each meeting to the school a few days before the meeting took place so that the children could see it and comment on any issues being raised.The community council said in a statement: ldquoWe would like to thank the four fantastic pupils from St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who attended the community council.ldquoIt was so refreshing to have such polite and knowledgeable young people along to one of our meetings to share their opinions and views on our agenda topics and ask the questions they feel most relevant to their lives.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming them along to future meetings and collaborating with them on the issues that affect all of us living in

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

A spokesman said it is not just sunburn, dehydration and hayfever which people need to be mindful of, but also respiratory problems, particularly the elderly.Dr Emilia Crighton, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clydersquos deputy director of public health, said: ldquoA number of Scottish people are fair-skinned and need to take adequate steps to ensure their skin is protected. As the weather forecast is for sunshine over the next few days everyone should take a few simple precautions.ldquoChildren are especially vulnerable and care should be taken to ensure they are covered up adequately.

With both sun-creams and sun protection clothing designed for babies and children there is no need for children to be over-exposed to the sun.Charity Age Scotland, which campaigns on behalf of the elderly, urged people to look out for their older relatives and neighbours, who are particularly vulnerable to high temperatures.Michelle Supple, director of charity services, said: ldquoWe would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything. Something as simple as helping open a window or popping to the shops to pick up some sunscreen can make a huge dference to someonersquos comfort and wellbeing.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWe would of course advise sensible precaution in all extreme weather conditions, and recommend people monitor and act on any weather warnings from the Met Office."},{"url":null,"title":"trans-rights-questions-yaniv-male-genitals-waxing-case-must-answered-scotland","story":"Concerns frequently pooh-poohed as misleading nonsense, the sort of scaremongering that never happens in real le. Unfortunately - for all concerned - fears have been realised.A trans woman, Jessica Yaniv, approached a number of female beauticians to ask for a Brazilian bikini wax, all - perhaps by coincidence - were lone home workers, the majority of whom were immigrant women.Unfortunately, Ms Yaniv was unable to find any beautician willing to carry out the intimate wax because she still retains male genitalia and each of these women only worked on female genitalia.:Are you trans  Next Scottish census to ask questions on gender IDMs Yaniv, a trans rights campaigner, then raised action against  of the women at British Columbiarsquos human rights tribunal, alleging discrimination and seeking damages of several thousanddollars from each.It was too much for several of the women to fight and so they folded their businesses instead, losing their livelihoods.The case cleaves opinion in two: either it is discriminatory of the beauticians to refuse to wax a trans womans genitals regardless of what they look like, or it is discriminatory to force a woman to handle male genitals against her will.The tribunal will make a decision - and that decision may well be to disregard womens boundaries and dignity by finding for Ms Yaniv and asserting that the law believes it is discrimination for women to refuse to touch a penis when that penis belongs to a trans woman.Ms Yaniv has posted deeply troubling comments on social media about young girls, although she claimed at the tribunal her account was hacked. There are those who would say she is vexatious and should be disregarded. Fiona Robertson, the SNPs National Womens and Equalities Convener, says Ms Yaniv is a female predator and that women predators often use their womanliness to gain access to victims.Critics of Ms Robertsons stance would strongly dispute male predatory behaviour being attributed to women.I would not dream of speaking for trans people but Im going to take a stab that the vast majority just want to get on with their lives peaceably and,asked about the Yaniv case, would be of the \"not in my name\" persuasion. Trans people cannot want this sort of legal action either, yet activists and allies have remained silent on the case.However, it cant be ignored and certainly not by a Scotland where there is a bitter ide between trans allies and, for want of a better shorthand, womens allies.Trans woman are women has become a political slogan in support of self ID and of respecting the rights of trans people but to take it to its conclusion is to fundamentally redefine the word \"woman\" and remove the element of sex from the words definition.The argument from some feminists is that the introduction of self ID is the beginning of a creep towards removing womens sex-based rights.Currently \"sex\" is a protected characteristic and so, for example, womens refuges have the right to refuse to house male-bodied people or, indeed, employ male-bodied people.Jo Swinson, the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, has been highly vocal in declaring that trans women are women but less clear in defining exactly what she means. If it is the Liberal Democrats stance that trans women are literally women then it suggests the Liberal Democrats would support the removal of the sex-based exemption.To avoid Yaniv-style legal cases, the Scottish Government must be explicit in how the Equality Act will apply to any new law.But explicit answers to troubling questions are exactly what this public conversation is lacking and no wonder when you have an MP, Mhairi Black, calling women who disagree with self ID \"Jeremy Hunts\", a rhyming slang it takes no genius to work out.The Scottish Government already confuses \"sex\" with \"gender\" in its consultation on self ID. Pro-self ID campaigners have pointed to the reassurance that there will be the protection of up to two years prison term for those who abuse self ID. Butyou cannot define \"woman\", how can you legislate effectively to determine who is or isnt really living as a woman : years of Stonewall: The fight for LGBT rightsIn Canada too, a woman has reported to the human rights tribunal that a womans shelter for recovering addicts made her homeless because she refused to share a twin room with a trans woman. The woman was a rape victim and felt frightened at being in close quarters with a male-bodied person who was \"masc presenting\", that is, maintained a beard and wore typically masculine clothes.There was no suitable alternative space in the refuge and so the woman was asked to leave. This is another scenario women have raised questions about but been given no clear answers.Scottish Womens Aid and Rape Crisis have both made statements saying they are in support of self ID. Rape Crisis also supports men so its no surprise the charity supports trans people - it would be an odd developmentthey did not.Scottish Womens Aid, the umbrella organisation for womens aid groups in Scotland, focuses on policy and research, it does not run refuges and so, while it supports self ID and takes a clear line that domestic abuse affects trans women too, its position is largely academic in that it will not have to deal with the frontline practicalities of balancing rights.Inidual womens aid charities in Scotland have gone on public record to say they have real concerns about self-ID.Wouldnt it be useful, instead of sloganeering and calling women c****, for politicians and charities to give explicit, detailed answers to questions being asked  The only way to allay fears is to tackle them head-on.Women are told their boundaries are not under threat - the Yaniv case contradicts this. They are told there is no conflict when it comes to women-only spaces such as refuges, they are told men will not pose as trans women to gain access to womens spaces - there are multiple cases in Canada of this happening.It will only help the debate to progressquestions raised in Canada are answered in Scotland - for the benefit of everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"english-mp-appointed-scotland-office-minister","story":"The Prime Minister passed over  Scottish Conservative MPs to give the role to Robin Walker, the MP for Worcester, who will also double as a Northern Ireland minister.A huge honour to be made Minister for the union working with @BorisJohnson @ScotSecofState  @NIOgov - our precious union deserves to thrive through brexit  beyond.

Irsquom in the business of finding things. I donrsquot want to notfind things.He said he had decided to take on the challenge at last after recent research and evidence gathered by another group of explorers convinced him that Ms Earhartrsquos plane might be found on the uninhabited Nikumaroro Island.His team will search the land and surrounding sea for proof Ms Earhart and Mr Noonan ended up there.

Not only were the team from VisitScotland a great bunch to work with but the countryside we crossed in pursuit of our payload is one of the most beautul and dramatic landscapes we’ve visited. “Once the Coosmonaut was back in our hands, we were genuinely sad to leave and head back to England.”A new tourism map highlighting Scotland’s links to space exploration and the first moonwalk has also been released.On the new trail...among the Scottish landmarks on the new VisitScotland map is the dark sky observatory in Dalmellington, Ayrshire.The Scotland is Out of this World trail is part of the new VisitScotland campaign of the same name.The trail features Scottish connections to each planet in the solar system, as well as fun facts and details of science centres and the best places to stargaze.Highlights incude:data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.gallowaygazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"This is what , can fetch you across the UK\"  This is what you can rent for £, per month across the UK viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GALL | Article Teaser\"Mars – Glenelg, Highlands: In  the village twinnedwith a geological feature on Mars, called Glenelg.Jupiter – Loch Airigh, Isle of Harris: The loch in the Outer Hebrides portrays the planet Jupiter in the  Stanley Kubrick directed film, : A Space Odyssey.Uranus – Braemar: The birthplace of Johann von Lamont, an astronomer who calculated the mass of Uranus.Neptune – Jedburgh, Scottish Borders: The birthplace of th century science writer Mary Somerville who theorised that dficulties in calculating the position of Uranus may point to an undiscovered planet, which inspired the discovery of Neptune.Venus – Parton, Dumfries and Galloway: The resting place of th century physicist James Clerk Maxwell, whose name was given to Maxwell Montes, the planet’s only feature named after a man.The Scotland is Out of this World campaign marks the th anniversary of the Apollo  mission and US astronaut Neil Armstrong’s historic walk on the lunar surface.But it also celebrates the th anniversary of VisitScotland.Malcolm Roughead, chief executive, said: “For  years VisitScotland has helped position Scotland as a must-visit destination to audiences across the world.“It is therefore fitting that in our anniversary year we set our sights even further and travelled into space in what can only be described as a truly out of this world campaign.“Scotland is Out of this World offered the opportunity to delve into the past and celebrate the country’s contribution to space exploration and its ancestral links to one of the greatest moments in history.“The new trail reveals some of the country’s stellar attractions and locations to visit to firmly cement Scotland’s place in astro-tourism. “After all, our best views aren’t confined to our awe-inspiring landscapes but reach up high into the night sky above as well.”Ohio-born Neil Armstrong was proud of his Scottish heritage.

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything. Something as simple as helping open a window or popping to the shops to pick up some sunscreen can make a huge dference to someone’s comfort and well-being.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference. The more volunteers we have, the better it’ll be for our seas.”To get involved, call   and find out how you can organise your own.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

How could anyone watch Boris Johnson – a liar and a cad, with all the poise of a rutting walrus – talk up a No Deal and pledge to bring in an Australian-style immigration system without concluding: “Enough is enough” Each fresh cabinet appointment was a bell chiming the need for urgent action: Priti Patel, advocate of capital punishment, as Home Secretary Dominic Raab, supporter of proroguing parliament, as Foreign Secretary Michael Gove, butcher of the English education system, as head of the Cabinet Office. If those names weren’t enough to convince you to put your X beside the Yes box on a putative independence ballot paper, then what would it take  Katie Hopkins as Propaganda Secretary  The Big Bad Wolf as Minister for Housing In the three years since Leave’s victory, the two countries have drted further and further apart. And Johnson is the best recruiting sergeant the SNP could have asked for, which is why Nicola Sturgeon was quick to say she would consider accelerating plans for the second independence referendum she has already pledged to hold before .There are huge logistical obstacles to overcome we know the new Prime Minister is even less likely than Theresa May to grant a Section  order for a legally binding plebiscite. But with a UK government now aping Trumpian politics and refusing even to feign interest in its northern neighbour, there could be no better opportunity to win over No voters.Unfortunately, this opportunity has presented itself at the worst possible time for both the SNP and the wider Yes movement, which are in the process of tearing themselves asunder. Divisions between the left and right wings, the gradualists and the revolutionaries, the newbies and the old-timers, which were kept in check by the party machine and the need to unite behind their common cause in , have exploded into the open. The internal feuding is now so visible, and the atmosphere so poisonous, the campaign is faltering, just as it ought be gaining momentum. One of the most volatilefaultlines has been the reform of the Gender Recognition Actwhich –passed – would allow trans people to self-identy and remove the requirement for medical evidence. Less than a year ago, this was regarded as an easy win – a human rights issue that would consolidate the party’s reputation as a progressive force. But this gambit backfired. Every day now, political Twitter resounds to the angry exchanges between party members who have positioned themselves on either side of this fractious debate. Disagreements over policy are not unusual what sets this apart is the rancour of the rhetoric, and the bad faith, with some members of both camps resorting to abuse and others regarding it as a make-or-break issue for their continued membership of the party. So problematic has it proved that the reforms have been put on hold. However, instead of providing a cooling-off period, the delay appears to have created space for acrimony to fester and grow.Further isions are being caused by a perceived inertia at the top of the party. Johnson’s election has increased the pressure for action. With no obvious mechanism to achieve a second referendum, some on the fringes are demanding a Unilateral Declaration of Independence .Given there is no evidence of a majority in favour of separation, this would be reckless in the extreme. It would leave us isolated and raise the spectre of civil disorder. And yet those who resist the idea – many of whom were campaigning for independence before their critics were born – are having their commitment questioned.Throw into this melee, the implosion of All Under One Banner– the flag-fixated organisation beloved of the Trumpian tendency, but scorned by much of the mainstream, and you have a highly combustible set of circumstances. That AOUB would self-destruct – the director of operations Manny Singh was sacked earlier this month after being reported to the procurator fiscal in connection with breaching the Civic GovernmentAct – was entirely predictable, but cries of “I told you so” are hardly likely to placate those who may now be deprived of an outlet for their frustrations.Some of the party’s current problems are of its own making. It failed to recognise that the reform of the GRA, which could be seen as pitting the rights of two oppressed groups against each other, would be trickier to steer through Holyrood than the Marriage and Civil Partnership Act. It also ignored warnings about the need for senior party figures to clamp down on the extremists who frequently threaten its credibility. It is too late now to tame those wilder elements who shout about UDI.Though, for some, the isions are the product of sincerely held beliefs, for others they are proxies for a power struggle between those who continue to support Sturgeon and those who support Alex Salmond. Ever since a series of sex allegations were made against the former First Minister, and particularly since he was charged, the party appears to have been in the grip of a major power struggle between the two camps.Whatever the outcome, and however unfair this seems, the court case has the potential to bring down the First Minister and it has been clear for some time that Joanna Cherry fancies herself as the successor.Meanwhile, the UK political chat is of a possible general election in the autumn. With no likelihood of Johnson experiencing a change of heart on Scotland’s right to self-determination, this could provide the best route to the SNP securing a Section  order. A large rise in support for the SNP would be interpreted as a mandate for a second referendum and might allow the party to hold a position of power in a Labour minority government just as the DUP has done in the minority Tory government since June .In order to capitalise on this opportunity, however, the SNP would have to mobilise speedily and effectively. It would need to remember that only by parking its dferences and uniting behind a common goal did the movement drive the Yes vote up from  to  per cent in the last campaign.This time round, the dferences are more entrenched. The efforts to undermine Sturgeon have been concerted. With the court case pending, there is little she can do but hold her nerve against the plotters and conspiracy theorists to refuse to pander to those who fail to understand that independence – to be legitimate – must be the settled will of the Scottish people.If the party cannot see past its internal struggles and marshal itself into some sort of fighting force, it will squander the chance to rescue Scotland from the grips of the Tory cabal and the potential catastrophe of a No Deal Brexit. That battle can only be won by convincing the majority of Scots that independence will produce a better, more consensual kind of politics not merely a tartan version of the back-stabbing, ego-driven lust for power which has inflicted so much damage on the UK over the last five years.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"wanted nurse for remote scottish island with population of 170","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Isle of Raasay, which has a population of around  people, has not had resident medical cover for a decade, despite a long campaign by islanders to get a community nurse.The island, considered to be one of the most beautul parts of Scotland, is reliant on medics travelling from neighbouring Skye, with one GP surgery held once a week on a Wednesday, and three district nurses working on a rota Monday to Friday.: Historic Burns Monument reopens following major restoration work: Wanted: Teacher for remote Scottish islandFor the past four years, residents have been campaigning to get a nurse who lives on the island, as there is no out-of-hours medical provision.In December , NHS Highlands unsuccessfully tried to recruit a resident nurse.But hopes are high that a new recruitment drive could bring someone looking for a slower pace of le to the island, with a job ad closing next month.Anne Gillies, chair of Raasay Community Council, said: \"A resident nurse on Raasay will be a huge boost to the community.\"It will make an enormous dference, particularly to families with young children and our elderly population.\"Were all very happy at the prospect of having a nursing presence on the island again.\"Kate Earnshaw, district manager for NHS Skye, Lochalsh and Wester Ross, said: \"This is an exciting opportunity for a suitably qualied and experienced nurse to join the CommunityNursing Team and make a real dference to healthcare provision on Raasay.\"We hope this opening will appeal to candidates looking for a real sht in lestyle.\"Raasay is a wonderful place to live and work and we look forward to attracting lots of applications.\"The Band  post is permanent, can be full-time or part-time, and comes with a salary of £, to £,.He or she would be the first clinician on the scene in the event of an emergency on the island, would be required to provide on-call nursing cover, and would be the main point of contact on the island for the Skye-based GPs and rural medics at the MacKinnon Memorial Hospital in Broadford, on Skye.The role promises \"considerable autonomy\" as Raasays nurse will be responsible for assessing, planning, implementing and reviewing the islands healthcare needs.NHS Highland said it is seeking \"qualied, confident, competent and experienced\" candidates who must be \"adaptable and resourceful, working without a hospital or GP at hand\".Up to date clinical knowledge and skills are required, as is a desire to work in a remote, rural setting.The health board hopes to be able to hire more than one nurse for the island.A spokesman said: \"The post holder would have a lot of iety in their job every day is likely to be dferent as they would be dealing with patients from young children to the elderly.\"In addition to the professional challenges of working predominantly on their own, the remote location could present some challenges to everyday le, such as transport.\"For the community, the presence of resident nurse cover is greatly anticipated and will bring reassurance.\"Raasay is a wonderful place to work and live and to bring up a family.

The Prime Minister picks the cabinet,” he said. “Of course she would have preferred that I stayed in the cabinet, because we have a longstanding and very close relationship… [but] he wanted his own person.”Mundell stressed the dferences between the political cultures in Scotland and the rest of the UK – symbolised by the radically dferent editorial lines taken by the UK and Scottish editions of the Sun – as he urged Johnson to follow the Scottish Tory leader’s advice.“There is no doubt that Ruth has transformed Conservative fortunes in Scotland and has a lot of data and facts and experience about how that’s been achieved, and she does want to work with Boris to demonstrate what messages are important in Scotland, what people want from their political leaders, what they want in Scotland, what they want in the UK.“Scotland is a distinctive political environment… the newspaper environment, the political environment, the political priorities, they’re completely dferent. That has to be recognised.”Mundell pledged to hold Johnson to account as a backbencher over his promises to boost UK investment in Scotland and create a “Union unit” to scrutinise government policy – something he told the Prime Minister at the meeting where he was sacked from his job.“I’ve never asked a PMQ, so I’m quite keen to break my duck… I will have a PMQ submitted every week. I won’t be standing up asking Boris to agree he’s great. It won’t be one of those.”Mundell cited the  Scotland Act, which devolved income tax and welfare powers to Scotland – “perhaps people feel negatively about it when they’re paying more income tax” – as well as the £.bn worth of city-region deals as the highlights of his four years as Scottish Secretary.“One thing that I hope my successor [Alister Jack] will be able to do is complete that and make sure every part of Scotland has benefitted from a growth deal,” said Mundell. “When I visited the new concert hall in Edinburgh, the site of it, I pushed for that to be included in [the Edinburgh and Southeast Scotland] deal.“I persuaded the chancellor to back it even though it was devolved spending, so you can make a dference across the whole of Scotland, and that’s what I like to think I’ve done.”He said he was also proud of boosting the UK government’s promotional work in Scotland from the “pittance” being spent previously, arguing: “The UK government needs to make the case every day for what it does in Scotland, the way the Scottish Government makes the case every day for independence.” A new “hub” at Queen Elizabeth House in Edinburgh would be a “focal point” boosting awareness of the UK government’s work in Scotland, he added.Asked what his greatest regret in office was, Mundell joked: “As the st century philosopher Adele says, regrets and mistakes are memories made.“I was very disappointed that we didn’t get Jock the cat into Dover House. It was blocked by health and safety.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

At such a critical juncture, we need someone who is detail focused and sensitive to the complexity of the challenges ahead. In short, we need a statesman, not a showman.“Boris Johnson’s road to the Conservative Party leadership has been paved with destructive half-truths, bluster and outright lies, many of which helped precipitate the crisis from which he is now personally benefiting. With an impending no-deal Brexit and the stark choices facing us, we need substantive answers from him to what are incredibly serious and complex questions.“To date he has failed to demonstrate any real understanding of the needs of Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit and especially in a no deal scenario # needs that require more than merely a can-do attitude to resolve.“The Irish border is a delicate and nuanced issue, with resonance far beyond trading arrangements and with the potential to unpick the fabric of the Good Friday Agreementmishandled. It is also impacting on the ability of parties to restore the political institutions here. He now needs to demonstrate his ability to act with sensitivity and impartiality in his engagements with local parties.“It#s time to cut the bluff, bluster and bombastic rhetoric and start to provide the kind of reassurance business and civic society needs. Whilst I remain sceptical he will do that, I wish him well and will be more than happy to be proved wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories. Incidentally, Stephen is playing in the Black Box in Belfast on October . Make sure you go along. I’ll be back.Following Stephen we were treated to the haunting Gaelic sounds of Diane Cannon and Manus Lunny, followed by Clann Mhic Ruairi. Another rousing ending to another Arranmore evening was brought courtesy of the impressive Honeyfeet.You can check out the final weekend of entertainment at the Earagail Arts Festival at eaf.ieWe stayed on Arranmore island at Early’s Bed # Breakfast where you will get a great welcome from Jerry and his we Pat.We travelled to Arranmore Island on the Blue Ferry – https:arranmorefastferry tickets "},{"url":null,"title":"eilis ohanlon as a publicfunded broadcaster either it is impartial or it is not ","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The other is that it is not the BBCs place to tell licence fee payers what to think. Both are correct. Its certainly not necessary to share the views of those who still regard gay people as second class citizens, or who are uncomfortable with the reality that not everyone conforms to the same sexual or gender template. At the same time, it is not unreasonable to expect the BBC to stay out of the fight, not least whilst same-sex marriage remains such a bone of contention.Read MoreChurches ided on whether BBC should be taking part in PrideBBC NI denies that letting staff join Belfast Pride event risks its impartialityThe BBCs editorial guidelines do \"not require absolute neutrality on every issue\", but they make clear that \"where our content highlights issues on which others campaign, we must take care not to endorse those campaigns, or allow ourselves to be used to campaign to change public policy\". That sounds like an entirely sensible compromise.Of course, it could be argued that the BBC takes stances on any number of issues, even whilst pretending that it doesnt but at least the corporation usually makes a show of being impartial. In this case, theyll be taking part in what is billed openly as a \"weekend of protest\".Why then should the BBC not be equally free to back demands for a standalone Irish Language Act or second Brexit referendum Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetBBC employees are as entitled as any other person in Northern Ireland to hold whatever views they choose on political and social issues. If they want to take part as private citizens in the Pride march, or any other protest, thats their business.Gay people who work in the BBC should also be reassured that they are valued and protected.It is still misguided to use one of the countrys most powerful institutions as a propaganda battering ram, despite Section . of the guidelines requiring staff, presenters and \"others who contribute to our output\" to take due care that their \"external activities\", including social media use, dont raise concerns of a conflict of interest.How can those who hold conservative views on matters of sex and morality be confident they will be treated fairly by the BBC when the organisation has torn up these guidelines to put its official stamp on a campaign so antithetical to their views Traditionalists may well be on the wrong side of history, with polls here showing an encouraging two thirds support for same-sex marriage. The fact remains that many older people in Northern Ireland do still hold old-fashioned Christian views on homosexuality, and using the power and resources of the BBC to drag them reluctantly along the road to a rainbow-flagged Promised Land is just boorish. There are plenty of opinions held by the younger generation that future ages may judge them harshly for as well. Its not about who is right or wrong. Section  of the BBC code states explicitly that \"we should take account of the dferent political cultures and structures in dferent parts of the UK\". Either those words mean something, or they dont. The BBC has to be for everyone, not just those that bigwigs at the Beeb would be happy to invite to their dinner parties.Forgetting that mission is why the BBCs Director General Tony Hall was forced to admit back in March that the publics perception of the BBCs impartiality has \"weakened in recent years\". It really shouldnt take a genius to figure out why."},{"url":null,"title":"full of life and fun tributes paid to northern ireland chef who conquered kilimanjaro","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Punters zip-lined over kayakers and SUPers on the lake. Whoops spilled from the Wild Water Rapids. Activities booked ranged from Bollywood dancing to indoor bowling.Lodges smelled new.

No s. No buts. No more delay. Brexit is happening,” he said.“The EU’s leaders have, so far, said they will not change their approach — it’s the unreformed withdrawal agreement, take it or leave it,” he added.“We still hope they will change their minds, but we must operate on the assumption that they will not.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Boris Johnson has reportedly put together a ‘war cabinet’ of six key ministers to deliver Brexit Mr Gove said the Government would do “everything in our power” to secure a good deal for the UK, but said simply presenting Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement to Parliament again would not be enough.“You can’t just reheat the dish that’s been sent back and expect that will make it more palatable,” he wrote.Planning for no deal was now a “number one priority”, he said, as the paper reported that Mr Johnson had put together a “war cabinet” of six key ministers to deliver Brexit by October  “by any means necessary”.Chancellor Sajid Javid has said there will be “signicant extra funding” this week to get Britain “fully ready to leave” the EU on October , with or without a deal.The additional spending will include financing one of the country’s “biggest ever public information campaigns” to ensure iniduals and businesses are ready for a no-deal exit, Mr Javid told the Sunday .\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sajid Javid will announce new funding to prepare for a no-deal Brexit “Under my leadership, the Treasury will have new priorities and will play its full role in helping to deliver Brexit,” he said.“In my first day in office as Chancellor, I tasked officials to urgently identy where more money needs to be invested to get Britain fully ready to leave on October  – deal or no deal.”He added that he planned to fund  new Border Force officers and look at new infrastructure around the country’s ports to minimise congestion and ensure goods can flow.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said he was working on a cross-party alliance to prevent a no-deal Brexit.He told The Observer: “The political direction of travel under Boris Johnson is clear, and so it is more important than ever that we build a strong cross-party alliance to stop a no-deal Brexit.“That work will intensy over the summer, before parliament resumes in September.”Meanwhile, polls have suggested the Tories were boosted by a “Boris bounce” after the election of their new leader.Since Mr Johnson became Prime Minister after being declared party chief by Tory members, the Conservatives have gained  points to stand at %, a survey by Deltapoll for the Mail on Sunday showed.That puts them five points ahead of Labour at %, with the Liberal Democrats on % and the Brexit Party on %.ButLabour was to drop Jeremy Corbyn as leader, the poll says the party would shoot into the lead at %, with the Tories on %, the Brexit Party on % and the Lib Dems on %.The poll also found that opinion was evenly ided on the question of whether Mr Johnson’s partner Carrie Symonds should live with him at Number .While % backed such a move, the same number were opposed to it.Asked how they would feelMr Johnson married their daughter, % said they would be sad, while % said they would be happy.The poll came as Mr Johnson set out an eye-catching domestic stall promising a £. billion boost for left-behind towns.He also pledged funding for a new rail link between Manchester and Leeds and promised action on housing and crime, despite insisting he was not preparing for a snap autumn election."},{"url":null,"title":"catglowup twitter users share photos of cat

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon. Karen Patterson will provide a fluent French translation for European visitors.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face. He is the most lovable, happy and determined boy.It was during Matthewrsquos recovery in hospital that Louise learnt about Swim Labrsquos water-based physio technique from another mum.She first took him to a programme in Lanzarote in March but has since took him to Swim Lab programme in Fivemiletown last month. He will be ing in September and December.Louise added: ldquoWe have exercises and activities to do with him every day which I video and send to the instructors to view and they then set other exercises so the work continues between the sessions.ldquoMatthew is doing things like riding a pony which he enjoys, but he doesnrsquot realise that this is helping strengthen his core muscles while he is doing it.The next local fundraising event is a charity golf day and barbeque at Bright Castle Golf Club on Saturday, August .To donate please visit www.gofundme f matthews-wish-to-walk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down Rally has surprise winner  ","story":"REIGNING World Rally Esports champion Jon Armstrong secured victory at a sensational Carryduff Forklt Down Rally, which was round four of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Stage Rally Championship.Armstrong and co-driver Noel OrsquoSullivan mirrored some of his success in the virtual gaming world by taking victory aboard a McGeehan Motorsport prepared Mini WRC at the event which was jointly organised by Ballynahinch and District Motor Club as well as Rathfriland Motor Club.It was his first time driving a World Rally car competitively and after using the opening miles to settle Armstrong quickly became a major contender.He was fourth overall after the tricky opening stage before climbing to third after setting the fastest time through stage two.He was gradually building his pace and looked set to challenge for the lead during the second loop of stages when he got a puncture during the fourth stage. The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals.

Arthur, earl of Donnegal, the sole proprietor of this place, and of a fine estate adjacent, hath been pleas’d to send orders to several workmen here to draw up a plan of a Linen-Hall, conformable to the one erected at Dublin, but not quite so large and proposeth to have such a one forthwith built, at his own expence, on the ground which his lordship lately caused to be wall’d in off the sea in Catharine-Street, in Belfast, and hath now generously granted l. for that purpose[about £, in today’s money]. As this north part of the kingdom exceeds all other parts thereof for making Linens, where that manufacture hath been, for some time past, carried on to such height and perfection, and this port being a very safe one, where ships are already stationed to carry Linen cloth and yarn from hence to London and other parts of England, and shipping very plenty it’s not doubted but on erecting of a Linen-Hall in this place under proper regulations, and other suitable encouragement from his lordship, merchants from all parts, who formerly bought quantities of Linen in Dublin, will be inducted to buy here, where it can be afforded much cheaper, by which means this place may become a principal mart for Linen cloth and yarn. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button [Arthur Chichester, earl of Donnegal , was great-great-grandson of Edward Chichester, the governor of Carrickfergus and younger brother of Belfast founder Arthur Chichester, born in .

Northern Ireland was represented by eight bands and  drum majors who were all expecting to contribute to a decent haul of prizes and more especially seize the opportunity to get their names in the frame ahead of the World Championships which are now less than three weeks away. Sadly as with so many of the major contests this season it was a wet day to such an extent that the finale had to be cancelled. Our local competitors did not disappoint as they won  trophies which made the journey home that bit more memorable. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button In Grade  Field Marshal Montgomery had to settle for third place as Inveraray  District collected their second title in a row to move level in major wins with St Laurence O’Toole who had a disappointing day as they were placed fourth with second placed Scottish Power winning the drumming. In Grade  it was a Northern Ireland one-two with Closkelt winning the grade by a healthy margin ahead of Raa who won the drumming prize. In Grade A the much-fancied St Mary’s Derrytrasna could only finish fourth to St Joseph’s Clondalkin from Dublin while Battlehill took six place. Cullybackey, who are celebrating their centenary this year, had a brilliant win in Grade A. Our local drum majors continue to dominate as they claimed the three section titles. Louis Anderson lted his fourth major junior title of the year while four of the remaining five places went to local competitors. Kara Gilmour became the Juvenile champion and again four other places were secured. James Kennedy made it a Scottish double for both himself and his Closkelt band as he lted his second major title in succession which is particularly remarkable considering this is his first year in the Senior grade.Can he follow in the footsteps of Emma Barr who last year won the worlds title in her first year in the section RESULTSGrade : st Inveraray  District, nd Scottish Power [also Best Drums], rd Field Marshal Montgomery, th St Laurence O’Toole, th Boghall  Bathgate, th Police Scotland Fe. \"  \"  Reported On This Day  Years Ago : Plan for a linen hall in Belfast Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Grade : st Closkelt. nd Raa [also Best Drums], rd Portlethen  District, th Uddingston Strathclyde, th Buchan Petersen, th Royal Burgh Annan.

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

The pension applies to both Vale and Cardf council workers.Friends of the Earth Cymru congratulated the council.Spokeswoman Bleddyn Lake said: ldquoAfter years of lobbying by Friends of the Earth, itrsquos fantastic to see Cardf councillors taking the historic decision to stop supporting the fossil fuel companies that are fuelling the climate crisis.ldquoNow itrsquos time for all the local authority pension funds in Wales to follow Cardfrsquos lead.ldquoToo many have been hiding away from taking meaningful action, but a climate emergency means we cannot afford to be investing money in the very companies driving climate change.ldquoResearch has shown esting from fossil fuel companies is better financially and will minimise future financial risks for those with pensions in these funds.ldquoClimate change is the challenge of our age. We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.
