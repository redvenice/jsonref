He’s got a very busy schedule I imagine.Asked why Harry seems so at ease with the competitors, he replied: I think it’s because he’s around military people. It’s hard to explain if you haven’t served. I think that’s why he’s so comfortable, he’s around like-minded people.After meeting Meghan for the first time he said: “She was lovely, like you see on the TV. Very polite and humble, so just great.

That makes him a lot different.“I couldn’t imagine living the life he has and having that of normality and being able to do that, he must be really grateful for that.

It is cheaper than an egg donor and relatively unheard of.\u0027It still blows me away whenever I talk about it and I have to break it down into simple terms with explaining it to others,\u0027 Nancy, a fertility coach, said. \u0027Trying to explain IVF is hard enough, let alone telling people that our daughter had actually been frozen for 13 years.\u0027I had never heard of embryo adoption before then, it\u0027s not something that\u0027s overly popular, few people know about it and it\u0027s much less expensive than other treatments.\u0027Our embryo adoption process was under $5,000 which makes it so much more accessible to families because using an egg donor can cost up to $30,000.\u0027It baffled us, I had no idea how old the embryos were when we adopted them, I thought they would have been frozen for a couple of years, but she was created in February 2004.\u0027The success rate is 50 per cent with embryo donation, but with the first one we had transferred it worked and she became our Luna.          Nancy gave birth to Luna  in December via c-section after being in labour for close to four days      Nancy describes Luna as their \u0027miracle girl\u0027 who was frozen in time for a little over 13 years          Nancy and Chris started trying to conceive shortly before her 40th birthday. After six months without falling pregnant they decided to visit fertility specialists          The new parents are now trying to raise awareness of embryo adoption as another option for couples to fall pregnantThey kept hopeful even after a chemical pregnancy in 2016, which means she miscarried in the first two weeks prior to the foetus being detectable on scans.  \u0027No matter what happened, I remained constantly positive, I was determined that one day I would become a mother,\u0027 Nancy said.The pair found out about embryo donation, where embryos are donated from couples who have had a successful IVF cycle. After having their child, the IVF couple can choose to have their remaining frozen embryos destroyed, used for science or donated to other hopeful parents trying to conceive.\u0027Our nurse coordinator matched us with donors who had similar characteristics and were the closest match,\u0027 Nancy said.Princess Charlotte will make history once her new sibling...Children born after intensive IVF treatment may have a...Share this article\u0027Everything from their physical looks to their personal and health history, including things like cancer or psychological issues.\u0027We had three sets to choose from and the one we went for would give us Luna.\u0027It\u0027s weird that our daughter was here waiting for us both. We were warned it could take up to a year for us to be matched, but it happened within three months.\u0027After being implanted with the adopted embryo that had been frozen for 13 years, Nancy says she felt different straight away.\u0027It was incredible, it was like I knew I was pregnant and just had a feeling, I woke up that morning to take the test and it came back positive,\u0027 she said.\u0027I told my husband I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s real but it\u0027s positive, we were very excited and cautiously optimistic, but remained calm until we had tests done at the doctors.\u0027After the positive results were confirmed, Nancy had a \u0027blissfully wonderful\u0027 pregnancy apart from severe morning sickness for her first 14-weeks.          After the positive results were confirmed, Nancy had a \u0027blissfully wonderful\u0027 pregnancy apart from severe morning sickness for her first 14-weeks          After five failed IVF attempts and a chemical pregnancy, the Atlanta couple discovered embryo adoption, which is how they eventually conceived Luna          Nancy and Chris, who moved from New Jersey to Atlanta shortly before trying for a child, believe it was almost \u0027fate\u0027 that they conceivedShe was in labour for close to four days but after hearing her Luna cry for the first-time, she said it all became worth it as she was finally a mother.\u0027I was in labour from Wednesday night to Sunday morning and wanted a natural waterbirth, but after developing a fever I had to have a C-section,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was told that babies born through C-section are quiet, but not to be afraid or worried if I didn\u0027t hear her make any noise. But Luna came out crying, it was like angels singing and the best sound I have ever heard.\u0027There\u0027s something about birth that erases all of the struggles, we had been trying for two and a half years to fall pregnant and finally had our daughter.\u0027Nancy and Chris, who moved from New Jersey to Atlanta shortly before trying for a child, believe it was almost \u0027fate\u0027 that they conceived.She said: \u0027We moved down here for a better quality of life and our little Luna was waiting for us here, it was like it was all meant to be.\u0027I always focused on being happy and nurturing myself instead of consuming myself with doubts that it would never happen for us. It was hard work but I credit it for giving me unshakable faith.\u0027When you are dealing with fertility issues, I think it\u0027s about layering everything from healthy eating and taking the proper supplements but above all practicing and developing a positive mindset.\u0027If you don\u0027t believe you\u0027re going to be a mom, it can just get further and further away from you.\u0027Once you start to focus on being loving yourself and life regardless of being pregnant, it helps you follow a path that will lead to success no matter how that baby comes into your life.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/08/09/4AF04D0D00000578-0-image-a-47_1523177989691.jpg","title":"Yulia Skripals family fear held detention Britain","story":"\u0027She has a life here\u0027: Cousin of spy poisoning victim claims Yulia Skripal is desperate to return to Moscow"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/08/17/4AF0578000000578-0-image-a-27_1523204637191.jpg","title":"Photographer captures breathtaking images icicle formations","story":"    Stunning: Incredible photographs capture the beauty of Russian ice caves on Lake Baikal, where large icicles have formed          The stunning ice structures inside the frozen grottos look like upside down gothic architecture spires and some are over 10 feet longCamouflaged… and probably very cold!

It might be his last word on architecture. There is the city – specifically Waterloo Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and the grimy lead-shot factory opposite the balcony on which he is working – and there is the ever-changing play of climate, atmosphere and light around them. The buildings are just a pretext for painting the sublime.Weather and waterlilies, haystacks, poplars and seascapes: Monet (1840-1926) is not an artist of bricks and mortar. And even after seeing almost 80 paintings linking him with architecture, I doubt anyone will have their mind changed on this score. Of course he is indelibly associated with certain cities – there are seven paintings of London, eight of Rouen and nine of Venice at the National Gallery – but the show’s premise is at the very least counterintuitive. What does Monet have to do with architecture? An early surprise is just how many different structures edge into his paintings. He paints a pitched fishing shack against a blustery sea near Le Havre and scarlet windmills cartwheeling across a flat Dutch horizon. One Parisian scene shows the side of an apartment block emblazoned with a massive advertisement, another centres on pedestrians milling along the stepped quays. A shadowy figure stands framed in a medieval doorway. Light filters through the sloping glass roof of the new Gare Saint-Lazare. In Giverny, in winter, the houses are like loaves of soft snow.So far, it seems as if Monet is drawn to them all purely as shapes, combinations of rectilinear or triangular forms subjected to weather. And many of these built structures conjure classic Monet – cottages shaped like haystacks bridge struts recalling stands of poplars or gondola poles. But it soon becomes apparent that architecture, both complex and primitive, offers Monet far more.The Pont Neuf in rainy smog is a study in the innumerable different nuances of taupe, grey and pearl. A red-tiled roof sharpens up the predominant green of a landscape. A tiny house is like an index to the vast scale of the surrounding countryside. Monet is always preoccupied by what the eye can take in of each scene, near and far, at the fullest scope and all at once. An early driver, he motored so fast around Giverny the mayor gave him a speeding ticket in 1904.Architecture is a constructive element, so to speak, in Monet’s picture-making. It might be a way of taking the eye into or around a painting. A vision of clifftops, sandy shore and the great opening blur of the sea is pinned together, for instance, by a little steeple. It is not much more than a circumflex, but enough to orientate the eye. And one of the most exhilarating works in this show, The Hollow in the Cliff Path at Varengeville, shows the eponymous path as a hot, dark gully leading to a tantalising glimpse of wild blue yonder. The sense of anticipation is intensified by a cottage high on the cliff, a kind of human surrogate that seems to see, and even to be looking at, what we cannot – the glittering sea beyond.The opening galleries are brilliantly selected to disrupt any conventional view of Monet’s evolution as an artist. In the early 1870s he is depicting windmills and Dutch houses, their gable ends traced in paint as stiff and thick as royal icing. And then here he is again, barely moments later, with a view of Amsterdam so hazy it’s nearly vanishing from the canvas and you think it’s all there, the substantial world transmuted into air.And then he jumps back, next decade, to lush strokes and oily accretions that build thick on the substrate and even, occasionally, to quite detailed cobblestones. His trajectory was never straight from old realism to modern abstraction. Subject always dictates style. Steam in the Paris stations is diaphanous damp sand at the new resort of Trouville is almost claggy the Doge’s Palace melts like golden butter.A notion, a recollection, an effect: his kind of impressionism does not deal in hard data. You couldn’t make an exact blueprint of the facade of Rouen Cathedral from any of the paintings in his great 1890s series. But you can deduce season, rainfall, the beauty of the circumambient air around the medieval structure above all, the passage of time.Monet worked variously in an empty apartment and a ladies’ clothes shop opposite the cathedral, for up to 12 hours a day. The effects were so fleeting – a colour, he said, lasts no more than three or four minutes – that he might alternate between several different canvases. At 8am the cathedral shimmers in lemon light but the streets around it are still in blue shadow. Later that morning the sunshine turns golden and the traceries have higher definition. At dusk, the portals fill with gloomy purple shadows.The angle shifts, the light changes, the focus pulls from one view to the next – in sequence, the paintings almost move.Monet compared the cathedral to a cliff. Architecture is nature by other means for him. Each subject is a structure on which to hang the memory of a gradual dawn, a glowing form or fog. That is what this marvellous exhibition reveals through its clarifying emphasis on one limited subject – that for Monet, the experience of seeing always comes first.And it is the same for the viewer standing before these ever-modern works. Rouen Cathedral, in rare loans from Belgrade and Cardiff, is translucent as fragile honeycomb or thick as rose and lavender blossoms, the surface muzzy and matt. In Venice, Monet floats on water. His cropping is so radical that the paintings put you right in the middle of the Grand Canal watching the buildings dissolve in the late light. What beauty there is in the art, the mind and surely the working days spent before the palaces and churches. People talk of the melancholy in the Venetian period, but it is not obvious to me. This late room is dreamily ecstatic.Boat-loaders on the Paris quays, the tricolour blur of fluttering French flags, the dark chimneys of the lead-shot factory on the South Bank: there are many unexpected scenes in this show. But no matter how erse, all are concerned with optical experience: the total effect on the eye, then the mind and memory. Each is a complete vision, not pieced together in fragments or details the very antithesis of architecture in that way.And from the Savoy, the bridges cross the Thames like the wooden structures over the pond at Giverny. Parliament becomes an apparition, its spikes softened by fog and dusk. They are all still there, the recognisable s, domes and towers, but not as stony structures so much as an ethereal stage for the ceaseless and ever-changing play of Monet’s art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee204099e044de123a4bc85db11afe8356f0587d/0_410_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=77f433c31b4b17f1281cb3ae5be18d05 2600w","title":"new centre point hoover building london luxury flats review","story":"Denounced as vulgar when they were built, these newly desirable London landmarks have been reborn as luxury flats boasting distinctive dimensions as well as chequered pasts“With Britain’s entry into the EEC,” barked an early 1970s advert, “Centre Point, London, offers an unrivalled opportunity to organisations with imagination to occupy this spectacular office complex.” How times change. Now, with Britain’s impending exit from the EU, the same building offers an unrivalled opportunity for iniduals wishing to spend £1.8m on a one-bedroom flat or £55m on a penthouse, the first of whom have been gradually moving in since last Christmas. A Crossrail station at its base will whisk owners from Tottenham Court Road to Heathrow airport in 28 minutes and thence to the new global opportunities promised by Brexiters.Meanwhile, nine miles west of Centre Point’s central location, the celebrated former Hoover factory, whose colonnaded art deco billboard of a facade merges ancient Karnak with American roadside industry, is also turning into flats. For there’s an entropy in the contemporary property business, its own second law of thermodynamics, which states that eventually everything becomes residential.These two white edifices, the temple and the tower, have something in common. Both were deplored by Nikolaus Pevsner, the architectural historian and postwar cataloguer of British architecture who made deploring into a one-man, quasi-nationalised industry. The Hoover, for him, was a “modernistic atrocity”, Centre Point “coarse in the extreme”. Both buildings, decried for their commercial vulgarity, have now inveigled their way into public and official affection. Spun around in the great washing machine of taste, both are now listed as buildings of architectural interest.Centre Point, completed in 1966, has a special status in cultural history, for the fact that it stood empty for years while its owner, Harry Hyams, tried to find the one big corporation that would take it at the rents he wanted. It was claimed that the developer kept it purposely unoccupied for accounting reasons, as he could watch his paper profits grow as property values shot up. Hyams, a publicity-shy man who once wore a Mickey Mouse mask to a shareholders’ meeting to avoid being photographed, took successful legal action against such claims, but empty his tower nonetheless was.At a time when, as now, there was seen to be a housing crisis, Centre Point managed to unify the Tory minister Peter Walker and the folk group Lindisfarne in opposing its sterile, antisocial pursuit of profit. The former attacked this “incredible scandal”. “Your madness is making a machine of everyone,” went the latter’s 1972 single All Fall Down, which featured the tower on its sleeve. Architectural reviews were more varied. Not everyone shared Pevsner’s scorn: some critics scented swinging London in its slender profile and zigzag rhythms. Neither Hyams nor his pipe-smoking architect, Colonel Richard Seifert, was exactly Mick Jagger or Marianne Faithfull, but you can see what these observers were thinking.It is indeed London’s most stylish tower, even now, when, in quantity if not quality, there is so much competition. Broad on its two convex faces and miraculously thin at its ends, it has the merit of changing in proportion as it appears from different parts of the city. It tapers towards the top, like a classical column. Its skilful and bold structure, by the engineer Wilem Frischmann, is worn on the outside, in the form of that zigzag lattice, precast with a concrete mix of almost marble-like whiteness. The tower occupies its singular spot with confidence and bravura, terminating Oxford Street and calling across Fitzrovia to its equally idiosyncratic contemporary, the BT Tower. It has presence, its mass energised by the design’s devotion to angles other than 90 degrees.Centre Point is the outcome of particular forms of talent, not all of them concerned primarily with beauty: Hyams’s as a developer, for example. It grew from Seifert’s special skill at working the planning system to his clients’ advantage, in this case giving the local authority a traffic gyratory system that they wanted in return for unexpected height. Seifert’s design partner, George Marsh, whose name is attached to a majority of the practice’s most memorable buildings, borrowed liberally from the great buildings of the recent past to give Centre Point its distinctive look. The profile owes much to Gio Ponti’s Pirelli tower in Milan, the expressive concrete to the mature work of Marcel Breuer. You can call it homage, or copying, but it works.Cynical and expedient though it partly was, Centre Point had architectural qualities – form, composition, detail, depth, light and shadow – that are hard to find in most speculative buildings, then as now. So it is welcome that it should be given a new life by the developer Almacantar and the architectural practice Conran and Partners in an updated version of Seifertian louche luxury. A pedestrianised open space, to the designs of another practice, Mica, will open in phases from this summer.The worst part of Seifert’s design was always the gyratory system that the planners saw as its main benefit, which, together with some wilfully mean pavements, made for an obnoxious and dangerous public space. The revamp loses some of the dynamism and distinctiveness of the old, but it’s preferable not to be asphyxiated and run over.The Hoover factory, now known as the Hoover building, never reached Centre Point’s heights of controversy, but when it opened in 1933 in the nascent suburb of Perivale, it was still seen as a dangerous manifestation of an arterial-road Americana that the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 would eventually stamp out. Like Centre Point, it combines stasis and motion, with the venerable forms of ancient Egypt repurposed to attract the attention of drivers on the roaring A40.It, too, has been set to music, although more affectionately than Centre Point, in Elvis Costello’s Hoover Factory of 1980. “Must have been a wonder when it was brand new,” he carolled. And it has always been a delight, for its powerful horizontals offset by insistent verticals, for the exuberant ornament that plays off its solemn columns, for its absolute indifference to stylistic propriety, which allowed its architects Wallis Gilbert and Partners to throw Bauhaus glazing, expressionist corner windows and Native American forms into the eclectic mix. Its colours too: its sunny white concrete, the hopeful minty green of its steel window frames, the outbursts of red and rich blue in its glazed bricks.“One of these days”, as Costello sang, it’s “gonna be all the rage in those fashionable pages”. And here it is, its value enhanced by the shocking demolition in 1980 of the nearby Firestone factory, also by Wallis Gilbert and Partners, over a bank holiday weekend. (Its owners wanted to pre-empt the Firestone’s probable listing.) The Hoover building is now in its second reincarnation, having been taken over by Tesco in the 1980s. Its less glamorous rear buildings were replaced by a superstore that still stands. Its front, used for offices by the retail giant, is now apartments, laid out to the designs of the engineering and architecture practice Interrobang.The most interesting thing about Interrobang’s conversion, a light timber frame designed to minimise loading on the existing structure, is sadly not visible. It would have been nice to keep a sense of this, as if installing an inside-out Amish village in the old factory, but the conventions of the residential property market don’t allow for such adventure. What you get instead are flats of proportions and spatial complexity that come from their adjustment to the old fabric.There is some weirdness – the noise from the road and from Tesco deliveries means you mostly can’t open windows and have to rely on a ventilation system for fresh air – but the spaces are still livelier and richer than you’d get in a new building.Centre Point makes for nice flats too (as they should be for the price): long and slightly curving glass walls combined with the reassuring depth of the structure. This makes one grateful for the listing of relatively modern buildings, eccentric though the system sometimes is. As the rest of the planning system gets ever more flaccid, listing at least obliges architects to come up with non-standard designs and developers to pay them to do so.The pioneering engineer of Centre Point looks back on the London landmark’s construction and the new type of building it ushered inThe engineer Wilem Frischmann, now aged 87 and still working, was not yet 30 when he designed the structure of Centre Point in central London. He says the site was made so complicated by pre-existing sewers and tube tunnels that no one had thought it possible to build much more than a single storey there – “only some shops”. “When I grew up,” says Frischmann, “I was told you can’t build tower blocks on clay” – the stuff on which London stands – so he made a point of showing that you could. Frischmann’s method was to drill close-packed piled foundations into the ground (he inspected the holes himself, got stuck in one and had to spend the night there until it was discovered how to get him out). The tower above is then unusually light, using thin floor slabs and the system of external structural elements that are the building’s signature. Precast in Portland, Dorset, and trucked to the site by night, these enabled the tower to rise at a rate of a storey a week. Their concrete was exceptionally strong, and its steel reinforcement has not suffered from the sort of corrosion that often forces structures of Centre Point’s age to be demolished.Frischmann, a man unafraid to point out his achievements, is most proud of the glazed walls of a horizontal box that is a bridge between the tower and a lower block, over what was until recently a busy road. This, he says, is the first use of structural glass – panels that support themselves without the help of frames. It has become commonplace in sleek modernism since. How did he come up with the idea? “I just tried to do things differently,” he says.

Helen Mayo, resident of Upper Sweet Dog Lane, reports that her neighbour, Bob Honey, is doing weird stuff.Cactus Fields, a care home in the desert that has been deserted – summer 2016. A man takes out a mallet and kills three old people.Meet Bob Honey. He lives alone after his wife left him. A woman who concentred candy smells to her crevices offering him only her identity-infidelity and her abhorrent ascensions to salacious sessions of sexual solitaire. Bob doesn’t know what any of this means. Only that he thinks it sounds tough and grown-up. He now wakes up to the thrum of his throbbing thesaurus in search of ever more woeful whimsy, ever more aggravating alliteration.It wasn’t always like this. Previous he did other stuff. The hyper-reality of real estate, the pandering picnic of commercial waste. In 2003, Bob went to Baghdad to breathe the Muslim air, feverishly figuring the faeces of Iraqis would be flowing in the streets. There he met the Guineans, foot soldiers of the Bilderberg Group-funded Scottsdale Program, aimed at reducing the methane in the atmosphere by wiping out the sharting seniors who were prone to frantic, feral flatulence.The doorbell never rings. The doorbell rings and Bob answers. “Hi,” says an unmanly male man. “I’m Spurley Cultier. A jobbing, jotting journalist jizzing with journalust. I’d like to talk.”They talk and Spurley leaves. Bob thought back to the last time he felt like he wasn’t just doing stuff. It had been with Annie. They had met on a park bench. She may have been young. Too young. But Bob never bothered with those distinctions. Annie was airless with alopecia. For reasons known only to Annie, she decided to have sex with bouncing Bob.“You have a magical vagina,” he said, the sensation of Roman arrows careening chaotically within his skull. “Though I could do with a bit more Vietnam.”“Next time I’ll wear my moistest merkin,” she replied with tantric teasing.Whenever he felt these collisions of incubus and succubus, he punched his way out of the proletariat with the purposeful inputting of covert codes, thereby drawing distraction through Scottsdale deployments, evading the viscount vogue of Viagratic assaults on virtual vaginas.Three days later, while Bob is moulding his molecular mallet, a text arrives from Annie. A photo of a black dildo. He drives to Vegas and finds it lying on the pavement and takes it out to the sand where he subatomises it with Semtex. When he gets home, Spurley is waiting for him. The journeying journo makes notes about Bob’s monumental mono mentalism unaware Bob can decode the script by sacred sense. Next door, a helicopter hovers over Helen Mayo’s house, before helicoptering hellishly into the ravenous roof and incinerating all the insipid inhabitants into crispy creme croaks.“I guess I’d better leave,” Spurley shrugged. Neither man was that concerned about the conflagration. Bob left to do more stuff. Both with his marvellous mallet and without. On one trip back from brachycardiac Bolivia, he sailed on a boat with a drug dealer who later absquatulated alone into the varietal void.There was another ring on the doorbell that never rang. This time it was Sean’s editor. “We need to talk, “ he said. “The confluence of cosmic conversation,” Bob curlewed. “Thing is, this book just isn’t working,” said the editor. “Worse than that, it’s an embarrassment. Stringing together random words under the impression you’re a latterday Hunter S Thompson isn’t writing.”“How about I put some drugs stuff in then?”“Have you listened to a word I’ve said?”Bob believes Scottsdale has been infiltrated by Loodstar. Don’t ask. Unaware that only one person is still reading, he stops off in New Orleans to take seven tabs of litmus-red lysergic acid before heading to Florida. “Are you Annie?” he asks, having taken his magnificent mallet to 17 shuffling snivelling geriatrics.“No, I’m Anasmyrma.” Really, don’t ask. It’s not worth it. An operative pulls out a Magnum and shoots Bob through the head. Rarefied resins liquefied during a life languishing unloved were beginning to create new free radical initiation of polymerisation. Or, to put it another way, Bob wasn’t badly hurt.“You will still publish this shit?” he beseeched beggingly.“Cool. While I’m here, I’d also like to write a poem.”Things can get worseWhen Bob turns to verseHe rises real earlyTo do in spod Spurley"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/091219d8a820d12d3e2caada66a72c7bd5105597/0_733_4662_2798/master/4662.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d0303b1d0a5046db055d9ae1d8351978 1240w","title":"uk living rooms have shrunk by a third survey finds","story":"The living rooms of newly built homes in Britain are nearly a third smaller than equivalent homes built in the 1970s, according to research that charts how living space has shrunk to levels last seen 80 years ago.The study also found that modern-day master bedrooms were on average 13.4 sq m (144 sq ft) in size, compared with 14.7m (158 sq ft) in the 1970s.“Overall, Britain built the biggest houses in the 1970s,” said a spokesman for LABC but from the 1980s onwards “Britain’s houses started to regress”.The research points to a reduction in the number of bedrooms, which peaked in the 1980s at an average of 3.6 compared with just under three bedrooms today - the first time the figure has fallen below three, according to LABC Warranty. Overall, today’s homes are the same size as those built in the 1940s, the research found. The figures are based on an analysis of 10,000 floorplans of homes built since the 1930s and taken from property sites such as Rightmove and Zoopla. LABC Warranty started its analysis for 1930s homes because of the lack of data available for properties built before then: “Whether they have been knocked down to make way for new housing developments or turned into student accommodation, there simply weren’t 10,000 houses available for us to analyse,” they said. The figures will add to the growing controversy over “rabbit hutch Britain”, with the boom in office-to-residential conversions, particularly of urban 1960s tower blocks free from the usual space standard requirements, resulting in a spate of “shoe-box homes”.The Guardian found one property in the centre of Croydon measured just 14.9 sq m, even though government guidance states that the minimum floor area for any new home should be 37 sq m.“We were also passed drawings of plans for an eight-apartment development in Archway, north London – in Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North constituency – where two of the units measured just 13.5 sq m (145 sq ft). That’s a room measuring just 12ft by 12ft. The plans were rejected by the council. In 2014, researchers from Cambridge University found that, at an average of 76 sq m, the UK’s newly built homes were the smallest by floor area in Europe, some way behind the next worst, in Italy and Portugal, at 81.5 sq m and 82.2 sq m respectively. Danish homes were by far the most spacious, at 137 sq m, followed by Greece, at 126.4 sq m.Developers of modular homes, pre-fabricated cheaply in production-line factories, argue that micro-homes offer a solution to the urban housing crisis. One social housing provider in south-west London has pioneered factory-made units that are 26 sq m in size, which it says is suitable for single young people to rent while they save for a mortgage deposit.

But 30 years ago, when the author was growing up there, Canary Wharf was a wasteland. She tracks the shifts and asks: was it worth it?The house I lived in, growing up on London’s Isle of Dogs, was beside a huge gate and high walls – impenetrable barriers even to the naughty kids who wanted to explore the docks beyond. My friends and I remember glimpses of watery wastelands as we walked off the Thames peninsula that we all called “the Island”, on rickety bridges whose gaps and creaks featured in our nightmares.When, 30 years ago this month, Margaret Thatcher drove the first pile for Canary Wharf and promised a land of opportunity, those high walls came down. But by the time its celebrated pyramid roof was placed on One Canada Square in 1991, Thatcher had been ousted and the London commercial property market had collapsed. It was quite possibly the worst time to launch and, within a year, Olympia and York, the company charged with making the neoliberal dream of turning redundant docks into the reality of a gleaming financial citadel, filed for bankruptcy.But now, Canary Wharf provides as many jobs as the docks did when they acted as a linchpin between the City of London and the global trade of the British empire. Canary Wharf’s first building, the second tallest in the UK after the Shard, is now as much a part of London’s skyline as the Empire State in New York and the area, with a further massive expansion already under way, is now more Wall Street than wasteland.Yet the past three decades have not only tracked the boom and bust of the UK economy but have left the Isle of Dogs a microcosm of the social revolution that has changed the face of Britain. At the same time, the extremes of income inequality – from great wealth to desperate deprivation – have revealed social tensions that bedevil the country as a whole.My mum and sisters still live on the island and I go back all the time when the development first started, I had just gone to university and each holiday brought a new road network to negotiate and a new building site to discuss. I thought things could only get better for everyone living there, yet it took the surprise of Brexit to make me realise that the reality has been very different.Local deprivation levels are among the worst in the country and a sense of powerlessness, which may have started as a reaction to the unaccountable regeneration scheme, now seems more widespread. The transport, shopping and leisure opportunities might have been revolutionised, but for a surprising number living there, Canary Wharf appears just as impenetrable as the docks were when I was a child.Someone who remembers these times keenly is the Right Rev Nick Holtam, now the bishop of Salisbury. He was appointed to the local church in 1988 with an episcopal remit to try to improve community relations. Residents objected to the unelected nature of the London Docklands Development Corporation, the quango in charge of planning: there were marches and protests, one involving 60 dog-driven sheep and more than 150 bees.Holtam remembers taking his congregation to a special service beside Millwall dock. “For lots of people, that was new territory, but there’s an invisible wall now, isn’t there?” he says. “People who live round the edge don’t all feel as though it’s their space to go into and it feels quite smart and City and businesslike.”There have been enormous successes, of course, many of which were trumpeted in a special report commissioned by Canary Wharf to mark this year’s 30th anniversary. Canary Wharf Group has presided over the largest urban regeneration project in Europe, with more than 17m sq ft of London real estate providing the head offices for many global firms, from Barclays to Reuters. With 120,000 jobs, Canary Wharf claims to be the biggest single centre of employment in the UK.The change in the transport system has been even more remarkable. Young people at my old school on the island look at me like some sort of relic when I tell them that a 277 bus was the only form of public transport in the 1980s. It could take as little as 15 minutes or three times as long to get to my Saturday jobs in Poplar because of the way the bridge system played havoc on the roads. When the Docklands Light Railway was opened in 1987, everyone scoffed at its toy train driverless cars but, with a network that extends to Stratford and Woolwich in the east and Bank and Tower Gateway in the west, some 122 million people use it every year. Throw in, too, the underground lines: the Jubilee line opened in 1999 and, by the end of this year, a new east-west Elizabeth line station will be in place at Canary Wharf.Looking back, the regeneration was a help to me personally. I was the first in my family to go to university and during college holidays I got lucrative work as a temp in some of the office buildings sprouting up. Yet for many residents, such employment has been harder to come by. Now, just one-tenth of the people working in Canary Wharf are residents of the borough, Tower\u0026nbspHamlets.The larger companies moving in, such as Citibank and HSBC, may have taken advantage of the big business rate concessions, but they have tended to bring their staff with them. Jill Skeels has lived on the island for 48 years and describes the difficulties her daughter faced trying to get a local job. “I walked round the whole of Canary Wharf with my daughter, giving out CVs … never heard another word. So imagine how we feel. When you think of all what we’ve put up with and our kids can’t even get anything. I don’t think you’re bitter, I don’t think that’s the right word, but you just feel walked\u0026nbspover.”Years ago, talking to students from my old school about becoming a journalist, I remember one teenager saying she wanted to work in an office but couldn’t imagine getting a job in Canary Wharf. At the time, I think I brushed it off as one 14-year-old’s lack of confidence but it stuck with me and now I realise she wasn’t alone.Time and again, talking to people in bingo halls or community associations, it’s the older white generation who are angriest about the changes. Rich Gerrard is an ex-docker: “The people in this area feel that no matter what they do, it’s a plan that they ain’t part of,” he says. “We are in the path of a runaway train.”Howard Dawber, who has been managing director of strategy at the Canary Wharf Group since 2004, says much of the early anger was from people such as Gerrard who “wanted the docks back”. Very few middle-aged dockers got jobs in Canary Wharf, though one, Peter Wade, was appointed as the development’s first community development officer in 1988. He became a local cause celebre, a “poacher turned gamekeeper”.The Canary Wharf Group, which has gone through several changes of ownership and now belongs to the Qatari state investment authority and global property company Brookfield, has spent millions investing in community projects or offering in-kind help such as mentoring for schools.Insiders say the biggest barrier to those wanting a job in Canary Wharf is education. There is one 11-18 school on the Isle of Dogs, George Green comprehensive, my old school. When I left to go to the local authority sixth form college at 16 – not enough of us warranted the school running a sixth form – I was one of only two students to pass my maths exam at the first attempt. Yet, pre-league tables, I can’t remember anyone but the handful of us who wanted to do A-levels really making much of a fuss.Far smaller when I was there, the school prided itself on an informal approach – no uniform and often chaotic classes. One friend of mine, an undiagnosed dyslexic, remembers skipping classes to take the books home to learn the biology syllabus. It was a tough school in some ways, with discipline often an issue, but there were, as there are now, some brilliant, dedicated teachers. Now there is a far more systematic approach and a relatively new head, Jill Baker, who has introduced tougher disciplinary measures.Given these demands, it is little surprise that the teachers are grateful for any philanthropic support they can get from Canary Wharf and others. Ian Cullenbrooke, the assistant head, says trips and careers advice would be pretty much impossible without it.It is true that several George Green pupils have benefited from mentoring programmes run by firms in Canary Wharf and even impressive internships, all of which would be far harder to get outside London. Talks from local high-flying employees are popular, but the teachers recognise that while many pupils say they want to be a bankerlawyerjournalist, far fewer of them have a realistic idea of how to get there from where they now are. There are, though, still norm-defying academic success stories.Wafa Mohbubul is the school’s 17-year-old head girl and hopes to apply to read natural sciences at Cambridge. With 12 GCSE passes and a regular job looking after the elderly, she is currently deciding between a summer internship at Citibank or Morgan Stanley in Canary Wharf. The height of my Saturday job success was working for Marks \u0026amp Spencer in Marble Arch, which meant leaving the island very early in the morning to get there on time.As in the country as a whole, the biggest underachievers tend to be the white working classes. The reasons are many and complicated and Cullenbrooke, who recently taught in a comprehensive in Dagenham, saw the same trend there.Recognising that there are exceptions to any rule, he says: “Students who come from immigrant families tend to be more aspirational. You know their families have come here more recently. They’re looking for opportunity and you know they’re trying to move on and to try to achieve as highly as they can. I think that with the ‘indigenous’ communities possibly you find more entrenched levels of low aspiration.”Of all the changes on the Isle of Dogs over the past 30 years, housing is the most extreme and the thing most likely to cause a sense of despair. Once an area with the highest concentration of council houses in England, it is now one of the top 10 locations for foreign investors looking to buy London property.The difference is in the extremes: estate agent Knight Frank found that a majority of Canary Wharf tenants are from overseas and the area can still feel a bit empty at weekends. By contrast, the busiest part is still the ring of largely substandard housing sandwiched between the river and the docks, the road I used to live on.Fourteen-year-old Josh Holmes is angry about aspects of life on the island and many of the changes. He lives with his grandparents, single mum, aunt, uncle and two young cousins in a three-bedroom house near the school. “Looking at the current housing state, what they’re doing is building for the rich. They should be affordable,” he tells me. “Looking at these houses they’re building down the road from here, I’m not going to be able to afford them. My aunt’s not going to be able to afford them.”Again, high-achieving Wafa is highly unusual in liking her council accommodation. She was moved, with her parents and three younger siblings, to a four-bedroom high-rise after their last flat caught fire. “We were emergency rehomed – it was life-changing because now I see the island differently,” she says. “I love it now.”She has a view of the river from her bedroom and neighbours who include homeowners in the penthouse flats: “You’ve got many contacts, so if you’re from a very low-income family, you’ve got your neighbour who’s from a very high-income family and you can just relate and increase your network.”Howard Dawber suggests that planners are now recognising the downsides of housing policies, which, though incredibly lucrative for many, have failed to provide a big enough mix, a failure to “create the steps for people moving out of social housing into low-priced, reasonable private accommodation. We as a society need to look at that gap in the market”.Newfoundland, a high-rise currently being built with stunning views west across the Thames, for example, will have 700 new flats to rent with a gym and concierge on site. The 300-plus social tenants will be in separate lower-rise buildings in Poplar. This is to provide low-rise housing for families and to avoid the “poor back door” of some developments, but it still suggests a kind of\u0026nbspsegregation.Wood Wharf, set for completion in 2023, is a further sign of the relentless pace of change on the island. But I have rarely known a time when the skyline wasn’t filled with cranes.One woman I interviewed who works in the Canary Wharf Waitrose but refused to give her full name wants to move out of the area, partly because of the nonstop building work. She used to work in several pubs, but all were closed down and turned into lucrative private housing, she says.Local objections have stymied some new plans, however, including proposals to build 2,000 homes in 33-storey towers, plans that would have meant the loss of a garage and, more importantly, encroachment on to the Mudchute, the island’s biggest – indeed, only – large area of green space.The Mudchute, created by conveying silt and slurry from the creation of Millwall docks was one of the places I loved most growing up and residents obviously still feel the same way. People started to keep animals and grow food on the Mudchute when Canary Wharf was still a disused warehouse named after the islands that produced its fruit and vegetable cargo.A 32-acre green space was the site of a sort of riding school and some weirdly generous scheme allowed me and a handful of horse-mad girls to skip PE once a week and learn to ride. I was so proud of the subsequent certificate in secondary education in horse mastership that I kept it on my CV for years. It was also helpful when I found myself studying at Cambridge, in proving I had “posh” habits.The ramshackle place of my youth is a now a fully certified equestrian centre with prices to match. Yet entrance to the farm and fields is still free, partly financed by a highly successful nursery that offers wraparound care.The fight to call a halt to high-rise development, to say “enough” to any encroachment on this incredible green space and example of community spirit – founded in the 1970s and still going strong today – feels somehow in the same spirit as all that talk of trying to get the balance between life and work right in Wood Wharf. Vicky Strong, assistant director of the Mudchute, doesn’t live on the island, yet she understands local concerns: “When I look at Canary Wharf, I think it’s amazing – to have something so grand on your doorstep. I still feel it’s an exciting time for the Wharf, but I think it needs to stop now.”Canary Wharf is amazing. Every time I use the DLR, I marvel at the access it provides, not just to the shops and towers but to Stratford and beyond. The new Elizabeth line will make the trip to Heathrow less than 40 minutes. Yet, while the development has brought jobs and prosperity to some, the fact that poverty and deprivation have increased for those living on the island is astonishing. It’s as though the shadows cast by these feats of engineering have left such dark spaces that nobody saw what was happening inside.The Long Shadow of Canary Wharf, presented by Jane Martinson, will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4’s Archive on 4 on Saturday 21 April at 8pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d1de64def104912af3a34cd0af48a0050b4ebb/0_256_832_499/master/832.jpg?w=645\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0da0aed1d9520db01b0fe3e953215f97 1290w","title":"energy home heating uk cities geology","story":"Scientists are finalising plans to exploit the vast reservoir of warm water that fills a labyrinth of disused mines and porous rock layers underneath Glasgow. They believe this subterranean store of naturally heated water could be used to warm homes in the city. If the system proves successful, such water could then be exploited in other cities and towns across Britain, they say.The £9m project will initially involve drilling narrow boreholes filled with instruments to survey temperature, seismic activity, water flow, acidity and other variables to establish the state of the water in the rocks below the city. The aim will be to establish whether this warm water can be extracted for long periods to heat Glaswegian homes.“The rocks below Glasgow are crisscrossed with tunnels that were hewed into the rock by coalminers in the 19th and 20th century,” said Professor Michael Stephenson, the director of science at the British Geological Survey (BGS), which is funding the project. “Eastern Glasgow was once the location of some of Scotland’s busiest mines. These old, long-abandoned tunnels should now be allowing water to flow freely beneath the city.”Because the reservoir of subterranean warm water is now linked by the tunnels, engineers believe they will not have to worry that water will dry up at an inidual location when they drill a borehole.Drilling of the first test boreholes – at sites yet to be selected – is the first part of an initiative by the BGS: the creation of several UK geo-energy observatories. Where other observatories look up to the sky, these will monitor conditions underground, say scientists. One test system has been selected for Scotland: the Glasgow Geothermal Energy Research Field Site. A second has been proposed for Cheshire – where scientists want to study rock conditions to assess the possibility of using underground vaults as storage for heated water.“At present it is very hard to store energy and that is a problem when using renewable power plants – such as wind plants – which operate intermittently,” said Stephenson. “Our second borehole array, again crammed with instruments, would allow us to test the feasibility of storing water – heated by renewable power plants – and then releasing that energy later when it is needed.”Heating of homes is set to become a crucial issue, researchers have warned. The UK is on target to decarbonise electricity generation as a result of the growing numbers of renewable power plants. However, the nation is still heavily reliant on North Sea and imported natural gas to heat its homes. Combustion of these fossil fuels forms a substantial part of the carbon dioxide emissions which the UK has pledged to reduceto help limit global warming.“One solution would be to use the energy beneath our feet,” said Stephenson. “The temperature of the water that is sloshing through the old mines and in the rock layers under Glasgow is about 12C. That is not red hot, obviously. However, there is a great deal of water down there and by using heat exchangers we can turn that mass of lukewarm water into a moderate supply of very hot water which could be pumped into homes to provide hot water and heating in winter. At least that is the idea.” “Our underground observatory will determine whether it is feasible or not. It will analyse rates of replenishment, acidity, temperature and many other features. Based on that data we will know if we are on to a winner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93b01a3bd8a98aec5dfea49833fe7d6f236e8ae2/29_49_1792_1075/master/1792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=18a5facff2d7cd4b2b6199b59a92271c 1240w","title":"all women programmes female film makers on demand streaming","story":"Seasons celebrating women behind the camera redress the balance while showing that gender is not a genreWhich makes curated programmes such as Mubi’s current The Present Is Woman, the Woman Is Present season, however unideal, spirit-lifting. If anything, the broadness of its female-film-makers-only remit serves to underline the pointlessness of pigeonholing an entire gender. On the mainstream side of the spectrum, there’s Elaine May’s once-maligned buddy comedy Ishtar, an absurdly wild and woolly Hollywood bro-farce that has been critically rehabilitated of late. At the distant opposite end is Hungarian Márta Mészáros’s Diary for My Children, an aching, hope-streaked and unjustly little-seen study of mourning and coming of age in post-Stalinist Budapest. Selections in between run the gamut from a sensual, honey-slow double shot of shorts from French-Senegalese actress-film-maker Mati Diop to Kathryn Bigelow’s punk-rave-era sci-fi kaleidoscope Strange Days, a still-electric vision with only Ralph Fiennes’s extravagant locks to tip you off that it’s somehow 23 years old.There’s also Documenteur, a teasing, well-picked deep cut from French New Wave queen Agnès Varda. If you’re looking to further brush up on your Varda ahead of the imminent UK release of her Oscar-nominated documentary Faces Places, however, head to Curzon Home Cinema, which has a pleasing eight-film retrospective of her work on offer, including 1962’s seminal, swinging vérité character study Cleo from 5 to 7 her later, tougher, more fractured feminist masterwork Vagabond and Jacquot de Nantes, an utterly beguiling early-years portrait of Varda’s late husband Jacques Demy, tenderly made a year after his death from Aids.Curzon’s menu also highlights a modest playlist of films by women, though not one as ersely or inventively selected as that on offer at the BFI Player’s Women With a Movie Camera collection, which includes modern essentials from the likes of Andrea Arnold (Red Road), Céline Sciamma (Tomboy), Lucrecia Martel (The Headless Woman) and Joanna Hogg (Unrelated), but also more esoteric, rarely exposed finds such as Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen’s theory-riddled 1970s mindwarp Riddles of the Sphinx, Sally Potter’s early experimentalist beauty The Gold Diggers and, of a more recent vintage, Anocha Suwichakornpong’s Kermode-endorsed By the Time It Gets Dark, a woozy meditation on art, activism and tobacco leaves.Finally, to Festival Scope, whose current, unsexily named Festival of French-Speaking Belgian Cinema, streaming until June, may not be gender-themed, but has a gratifyingly high number of strong female-directed selections. These include Amer, Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani’s visceral, bewitching psychosexual homage to Italian giallo horror, and a discovery in Rachel Lang’s short For You I Will Fight, a flinty, moving study of a female army recruit. Best of all, they’re all free to stream. So if you’ve never seen the collection’s most famous title – Chantal Akerman’s trailblazing Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles – a mesmerising study of weathered female psychology revealed through painstaking domestic routine – it’s never been easier for you to tackle it.Star Wars: The Last Jedi(Disney, 12)The all-slaying juggernaut makes its way to living rooms, and the harshly polarised debate over its merits can continue apace – though this agnostic thought it more idea-driven and visually dynamic than any of the franchise’s last five entries.Gook (Kaleidoscope, 15)You may have blinked and missed it in cinemas, but Justin Chon’s raw, funny, politically fiery Korean-American view on the 1992 Los Angeles riots is worth catching up with at homeThe Disaster Artist(Warner Bros, 15)Sexual harassment allegations against James Franco halted the mounting buzz for his Tommy Wiseau biopic – but even putting that aside, there’s not much to be gained from this japey stunt that you wouldn’t get simply from watching The Room.Stronger(Lionsgate, 15)Through no fault of his own, Jake Gyllenhaal saw awards hopes dwindle for this straightforwardly affecting biopic of Boston Marathon bombing survivor Jeff Bauman: his piercing performance, and that of Tatiana Maslany as his wife, deserve a second look.The Three Faces of Eve(Signal Hill, PG)A welcome Blu-ray release for this unavoidably dated but still-fascinating 1950s study of dissociative identity disorder in picket-fence suburbia, anchored by Joanne Woodward’s Oscar-winning double-somersault of a tour de force."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46fbdaa47632679136809b31330fc7b39ce7c1eb/0_685_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=364484e00162124aa03f5439ea792940 1240w","title":"john krasinski a quiet place emily blunt horror","story":"Nepotism alert: John Krasinski, the 38-year-old actor-writer-director, discovered the co-star of his new film, A Quiet Place, sitting next to him on the sofa. To be fair, though, the American’s wife is Emily Blunt, the Bafta and Golden Globe-winning British acor. A smart, stylish horror flick, A Quiet Place is Krasinski’s third film as a director, but he is best known for an eight-year stint as Jim Halpert in the US version of The Office. He and Blunt live in New York with their two daughters, aged four and one.A Quiet Place has a clever, innovative premise: the Alien-style monsters can’t see but have exceptional hearing, so the humans in the film have to be almost wordless. Are you someone who knows and loves horror films?No. Completely the opposite, which is crazy. I never was a big horror guy, because I was just too scared. That’s the truth. Then these producers called me one day and said: “Would you ever act in a horror movie?” I said: “I don’t know, I’m kind of a scaredy cat, but if it’s a cool idea maybe.” And they said: “Well, the idea is that this family can’t make any noise and you have to figure out why.” And I thought: “That’s as good a one-liner as you can get.”As part of the online publicity for A Quiet Place, you did a skit with your wife where you called yourselves, “The Krunts”. Are you going to regret coining that?Yes! I immediately regretted that – I’m not going to lie to you. I just wish I could do better for my wife, because we could have made Bluntinski, we could have done a lot of things. But Krunt is what comes out of it. I mean, just imagine if we came back to England and had a lovely estate, we’d have to call it Krunt Manor.What do people in Britain say about The Office?One of my favourite encounters was with a customs agent who said: “Are you an actor? What would I know you from?” And I said: “The Office, but don’t worry, the American Office.” Then, as he stamped my passport, he very under his breath went: “Well, I like it better.” And I went:“NO WAY!”You beefed up a lot for the 2016 film 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. What’s the best part of getting into that kind of shape?I remember Matt Damon saying this and it’s true: you pick your kids up and don’t have back pain. Like nothing. You can pick them up, toss them in the air and not feel like you’re going to the hospital that night.Do you get the feeling that your wife has a preference either way?I don’t think she does, but I’m sure she wasn’t upset that I was in great shape.You’re about to be the latest incarnation of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan in a new Amazon series. What’s your spin on him?Well, the whole thing for me is I’ve been a huge fan of Jack Ryan – I feel like he’s our James Bond. I mean, a lot less sex, but Bond nonetheless.So you want to play him with more sex then?No, I tried and they wouldn’t go for it. For me, he’s a character that I think resonates really well now: we’ve had so many stories about superheroes who can fly, superheroes who can shoot things out of their hands and I think to have a real person do heroic things is kind of a nice thing to put out in the world right now.You’re better qualified to talk about Paw Patrol then?Exactly, correct. That’s probably what I should do next: the reboot of Paw Patrol. That’s your headline: here comes the live-action Paw Patrol from John Krasinski.You have a reputation – in your roles and in press – of being a good guy, a gentleman. Is that important to you?Well, that’s very nice, first of all. And second, my parents definitely brought me up to carry myself without being negative, so there’s probably part of me that always wants to be a worthy son. But overall, hey, there’s worse things than being seen as the nice guy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14aa8d65b66e38bc77e5ca477a561e81539f455a/576_28_2869_1722/master/2869.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=13f729e355feff7669cd0723ac4bc637 1240w","title":"chelsea west ham united premier league match report","story":"The life of Ray Wilkins had been celebrated with gusto in this arena prior to kick-off, his death marked with the banners in the stands and flowers and a vintage No 8 shirt placed on the assistant manager’s seat in the home dugout. Both sets of fans had warmed to glimpses of the former Chelsea midfielder turned coach in action, clips that ned eras beamed out over the big screens at either end of the ground, with West Ham’s support bellowing out their own admiration in unison.The tributes were heartfelt and fitting. So it was to the 2016-17 champions’ exasperation that their side could not then produce the victory that would have so thrilled Wilkins from his seat just in front of the pressbox. The season-ticket holder would have rejoiced in some of his favourites’ attacking play, particularly when they were dominant through a one-sided opening period, and might have enjoyed the frantic intensity of the last quarter-hour once the visitors had plucked parity from nowhere. But, in reality, he would have cursed the fact Chelsea’s campaign is petering out in frustration.This draw left Antonio Conte’s side 10 points off Tottenham with only six games still to play and there was a smattering of boos at the final whistle. Chelsea have won only three league games this calendar year, their prospects of qualifying for the Champions League fading with each hiccup, and the head coach bemoaning the same inadequacies. Profligacy means the gap to fourth widened.“We must be realistic: if we are not able to win this type of game, we are talking about what?” the Italian grumbled. “You must win this game if you want to reach a target, the Champions League. Because the other teams are clinical, they are ready to suffer and win the game. At the end of the season, we’ll have struggled a lot. This game describes our whole season.”That summed it up. There were hints of brilliance, not least in the zest of Chelsea’s early approach play, which had threatened to sweep aside West Ham, but it was not only Joe Hart’s brilliance that kept the scoreline decent. The home side’s front three seemed to feed off N’Golo Kanté’s energy through the centre, the Frenchman a frenzy of interceptions and short passes, cajoling Cesc Fàbregas into action at his side.Willian and Eden Hazard were a blur of movement ahead of them and, when they clicked, that combination sliced through their opponents almost at will. Some of their more intricate play took the breath away, summed up when Fàbregas slid a pass from deep to prompt a rat-a-tat exchange at pace between Hazard and Álvaro Morata, with the Belgian smartly liberating Willian.Only Hart’s sharp save with his outstretched left leg denied the Brazilian as he bore down on goal. It was a fine intervention – the first of many from England’s current third choice – so to ship a goal from Hazard’s resultant corner, played short, seemed horribly careless on the visitors’ part. Victor Moses’ centre was looped towards the far post and nodded down far too easily by Morata, in amid grounded opponents. César Azpilicueta duly flicked up and away from a dozy Marko Arnautovic, dangling a leg weakly, with the Spaniard able to poke the loose ball into the far corner from five yards out. West Ham’s defenders had rather stumbled into the concession, concentration lapsing while they marvelled at Hart’s original save. “It was a really poxy goal to concede,” David Moyes offered.Yet, crucially, the visitors survived everything flung at them thereafter. Willian and Moses fired wide. Morata, with goals in his previous two games, was twice rightly flagged offside as he poked home – a reflection perhaps of anxiety as much as eagerness – with the script increasingly predictable. Arnautovic had fluffed the visitors’ best first-half opportunity, from Arthur Masuaku’s delicious diagonal, but the Austrian would make his presence felt before the end. Mark Noble launched an optimistic pass into the penalty area 17 minutes from time, with Gary Cahill’s header indecisive, neither a pass to a team-mate nor a clearance, with Arnautovic quick to the loose ball to pull back a centre. There loitered Javier Hernández, a regular scorer as a substitute against these opponents, to fizz a shot inside Thibaut Courtois’s post with his first touch of the contest.Everything in what time remained was frenetic, from Hart’s fine stops to deny Marcos Alonso and Olivier Giroud, to Kanté’s timely challenge on Arnautovic, bustling free of the home side’s backline. “Any player other than Kanté wouldn’t have caught up with Marko but I’d rather talk about how well the team kept at it,” Moyes said. “That level of form will be good for Joe, too. We played against a really slick Chelsea team, particularly in the first half, so I’m not disappointed with a draw.” His team are now six points clear of the bottom three and can sense safety. For Chelsea, the frustration merely mounts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d49e3805095a9db05e8a508012f0238a4c40815/97_110_3199_1919/master/3199.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=73d86766df4f36547ae06b6c4adf83f6 1240w","title":"pep guardiola manchester city hangover cure liverpool champions league","story":"Pep Guardiola has admitted that Manchester City’s inability to maintain a two‑goal lead against Manchester United could weigh on players’ minds when seeking to overturn a 3-0 deficit against Liverpool in the Champions League quarter-final second leg on Tuesday night.City led 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday through goals by Vincent Kompany and Ilkay Gündogan.

If Liverpool score once City would need five goals to knock out Jürgen Klopp’s side.Guardiola admitted concern at not being able to ensure his teams can maintain focus. “I thought many times about that. I’ve dropped a lot of Champions League games in the space of 10 or 15 minutes,” he said, offering an example of when he was Bayern Munich manager for a Champions League semi-final first leg in May 2015. “We were playing Barcelona and after 77 minutes it was 0-0, then after 90 minutes – 3-0. This has happened many times – maybe it’s my fault. I have to think about it.”“Always when you don’t win you will have made mistakes but the first half was good. The second was not.

Now it’s a test of masculinity fuelled by cheap airfares and alcohol. Sirin Kale hears about those who lost so much more than just a night’s memoriesReturning to his Ibizan hotel room, the stag notices that his best man is missing. Mike Rutter last saw Luke Rhoden when he put him to bed, after Rhoden suffered an adverse reaction to cocaine and ecstasy. Rhoden’s bed has been made. His shoes are lined up. Knowing instantly that something is wrong, Rutter begins calling his friend. As the call disconnects, Rutter turns around and sees the hotel manager standing in the doorway. His stomach rolls away from him, bouncing like a coin down Balearic cobblestones.“The last thing I said to him,” Rutter tells me, “was ‘Go to bed and sleep. If you need me, ring me.’ So that was the last time… yeah.” He trails off.After being put to bed, Rhoden jumped from a balcony. Observers described him as frightened and hallucinating. Police officers, apprehending him, pushed a plastic baton into his neck. Rhoden died. In 2016, a British coroner recorded that the cause of death was asphyxiation caused by the excessive restraining methods adopted by officers, as well as the drugs in his system.Back home, Rutter got married without his best man. “It was very difficult, to be honest,” he tells me. “It was a different wedding, let’s just say that.”For a long time, Rutter was haunted by the fact that he wasn’t there when Rhoden died. “I nearly lost everything,” he explains. “Bad depression. Counselling. There was a lot of guilt.”What happens when your stag do ends in tragedy? The loss spreads outwards, like a blight: contaminating everyone who comes into contact with it. “It takes a toll on the people around you. You end up treating people like shit. Wife like shit, kids like shit, everyone around you like shit.”All nine men on Rutter’s stag weekend have been affected. “Every single person in the group has struggled,” Rutter tells me. “To the point where one of the lads has moved to Australia. He just had to get away.”I first became aware of the horrifying trend of British men dying on stag dos when a girlfriend whispered in shocked tones of a man we knew who had gone on a stag weekend. By the time they went to wake the stag up in the morning, he couldn’t be roused. He was dead.To me, this seemed to be an astonishing and exceptional tragedy, but the more I researched, the more I realised that it was not. Although UK coroners’ courts don’t collate data on whether deaths are stag-do related, at least 30 British men have died in the past decade alone while on stag dos. Others have suffered life-changing injuries. And fatalities seem to be increasing: about a third of deaths over the past decade took place in 2017.Typically, the victims are men from tight-knit communities: family men, with partners or children. They have steady jobs and often play team sports. Many deaths happen overseas, in stag party hotspots, such as Budapest, Magaluf, Hamburg or Ibiza. Often victims don’t have travel insurance and fundraising pages for repatriation costs are necessary. “Bring Watson home to his family,” reads one. “An amazing guy deserves an amazing send-off.”The deaths I tracked fell, broadly, into three categories. There’s death by misadventure: often related to alcohol or drug abuse. Men die of heart failure after drug binges that leave them car-jacking vehicles, or they drink so much they die of alcohol poisoning. Balcony falls merit their own sub-category: typically, men try to climb back into their rooms while drunk. One Ibizan hotel, the Pisces Park, is notorious for stag-do balcony deaths – two British men died this way in 2015. The second category is death by suspicious causes, such as Rhoden’s death at the hands of police. Then there’s death by brute bad luck unrelated to stag-do activity: undiagnosed heart conditions, or blood clots.A covenant of silence, forged in party capitals around Europe, persists around stag dos. What happens on tour, stays on tour. But when men die on stag weekends, silence becomes codified into omertà. People don’t want to talk about the fatalities: interview requests fall on deaf ears.Sometimes, families are ashamed of the circumstances in which their loved ones died. “You don’t want people thinking bad things about your son,” explains one mother over the course of a tearful phone call.For others, the grief pounds as strongly as a new hangover. “I hate talking about Paul’s passing – it just makes me too sad,” writes the Racing Post columnist Steve Palmer, whose best man, Paul Bush, died on his stag weekend. Palmer sends me the column he wrote after Bush died. “Returning from Budapest with an empty seat beside me on the plane was a soul-destroying experience. I was due to get married just five days later, something I considered almost impossible… A week after the worst day of my life, came the best.”I make inquiries, pushing into people’s grief. As I’m writing, news breaks that a 29-year-old Scot named Liam Colgan is missing. Liam is his brother Eamonn’s best man and was last seen in Hamburg’s Reeperbahn district, an area popular with stag parties. When I speak to Eamonn, it’s been two days since Liam’s disappearance, and he’s returning home. He sounds weary.“I’m beyond worried,” Eamonn says. “It’s totally out of character for Liam to go missing. He doesn’t use drugs or anything like that. Obviously, he was under the influence of alcohol quite heavily, as anyone would be on a stag do. But for him not to have any contact with anyone…”Eamonn trails off, panic edging into his voice. “He doesn’t have his passport. He’s missed his flight.”Many cultures have rituals by which boys become men. In Brazil, male initiates to the Sateré-Mawé tribe plunge their arms into gloves full of stinging bullet ants. Afterwards, they are welcomed by the tribe, as men.Like the men of the Sateré-Mawé tribe, Brits are also expected to demonstrate their masculinity through the complicated and often costly ritual of the modern stag do. Dentist’s chairs – a game where you sit and have alcohol free-poured directly down your throat – were banned in the UK in 2010 as part of a package of proposals aimed at tackling binge drinking. However, they remain popular in many European stag hotspots. In 2013, a British man, Paul Tobutt, died at his own stag party in Benidorm, after playing the game. Sateré-Mawé men suffer trial by venomous ants British men endure trial by dentist’s chair. Both practices are likely to prove poisonous and painful.It wasn’t always like this. The modern British stag do as a performance of masculinity exploded in the late 2000s, with the advent of cheap airfares to European capitals – where alcohol is cheap, strip-clubs are plentiful and beer is super-strength. Films such as 2009’s The Hangover captured the spirit of this emerging phenomenon, and reinforced the narrative that a stag do isn’t a stag do unless something stupid or dangerous happens.“A generation ago, the stag night would have been the groom and some friends down the local pub,” says Dr Thomas Thurnell-Read, lecturer in cultural sociology at Loughborough University. Now, stag dos are a ritual of male friendship. “The stag passes from unmarried man to married man. The cultural urge to mark that transition causes all the hedonistic and ostentatious behaviour you see on stag weekends.”Reckless behaviour, as well as excessive alcohol consumption, is part of the tradition. “There’s this emphasis on ritualistically punishing the stag for this change of status. You humiliate him with fancy dress and make him get drunk,” Thurnell-Read says.Above all, the group takes precedence. “Being seen to not be drinking is an affront to the male-bonding ritual, to the idea we’re all in this together,” says Thurnell-Read. During his fieldwork in Krakow, Thurnell-Read witnessed men furtively tipping drinks into plant-pots, rather than admit to the group they didn’t want to drink any more.I want to know how stag do antics can devolve into dangerous behaviour. In a London pub, I meet 35-year-old Kit. He’s a veteran of more than 20 stag dos. “This is how people can die on stag dos,” he says casually. “When you’re in a group of guys, you regress back to how you were as boys. And there’s an amount of peacocking involved. You’re always egging someone on.”On a recent stag weekend in Hamburg, Kit witnessed a stag – dressed in a hamburger outfit – climbing a telegraph pole. “We’re chanting: ‘Have you ever seen a burger up a pole?’ So he’s like, fuck it. It’s 30ft and he’s pissed. Everyone’s chanting. Falling from that height, he definitely would have died.”Kit sips his drink. “But you don’t want to be the guy who spoils it. That’s why no one wanted to stop it being dangerous.”These often extreme stag dos offer up a romanticised version of male friendship but by contrast they also result in violence or injury. When masculine ideals are collectively being performed by groups of drunk men, it’s easy for things to go wrong.James Thorpe, 29, knows this first-hand. After breaking his neck on his own stag weekend in Magaluf in 2016, the former firefighter is now in a wheelchair. “I suppose a little bit of stupidity was involved,” Thorpe remembers. “We’d had a couple of drinks and saw some friends swimming and we were trying to get into the spirit of it, so we went for a swim. I’m not quite sure if I tripped or ed – I can’t remember. But I banged my head on the sea bed and broke my neck.”Luckily, a friend dragged Thorpe out of the water. “If they hadn’t found me within the next 30 seconds, I’d probably have drowned.”Since his accident, life has changed dramatically. “Day-to-day stuff is difficult. Getting yourself up is an effort getting dressed is an effort. I still have dark days, but I’m starting to get my independence back.”Despite everything, Thorpe would go on another stag do. “I haven’t changed my mind on stag dos,” he tells me. “They do have the potential to get out of hand, when you’ve got that laddish behaviour, a bit of peer pressure and showing off. That’s where they tend to go wrong. But I’d still go on one.” He laughs. “I probably wouldn’t return to Magaluf, though. Too many bad memories.”Messing around near water has proved fatal for other British stags. In 2015, 24-year-old Dale Joint drowned on his stag do after jumping into the water near moored boats in Salthouse Docks, Liverpool.“Until it touches you, you don’t really think about it,” his aunt, Gaynor Isherwood, tells me. “In one fell swoop, a night out ends up with this. It’s hard to take in.” After Joint died, Isherwood says, she felt like she’d been hit by a bus – and finally understood what that metaphor means. “He was just larking around with his mates.”Isherwood feels that not enough has been done to prevent similar accidents taking place at the docks. After we speak, I go online. “The recently renovated Albert Dock area is an ideal place to start any stag night out,” I read.Not all deaths are down to drunken misadventure. Sometimes, nefarious or criminal factors are at work. “Being in a foreign city tends to make people vulnerable,” Thurnell-Read says. “Especially if you’re in fancy dress. You’re very obvious. If anyone wants to mug or attack some foreigners, they stand out.”When men die on stag dos, it’s easy for them to be victim-blamed. No Ibizan civil guard officers have been charged with Rhoden’s unlawful killing. “They kicked it under the carpet,” Luke’s father, Norman, tells me. “They said it was a done deal, an accidental death. People think: ‘Oh well, it’s just a stag do, he had too much to drink.’”Entire economies are propped up by stag-do tourism. When money’s involved, there’s a vested interest in the authorities downplaying deaths. Justice may be a long time coming, or may not come at all.I speak to David Swindle, a private investigator working on the case of Craig Mallon, killed from a single punch on a Spanish stag weekend in 2012. “Numerous evidential opportunities weren’t pursued,” Swindle explains. “There hasn’t been the level of investigation we’d expect. And there’s a wider issue about a lack of support by the British government for the families of murder victims abroad.”“I’ve realised that my son’s death was just a drop in the ocean,” Norman agrees. “There’s big money involved. And what’s happening isn’t highlighted enough. As quickly as it happens, it’s forgotten. It’s only the people who were around that remember. I’ll be chatting to people I know, and they’ll say: ‘My boy’s off to Ibiza… Oh, sorry I didn’t realise.’ That’s how quickly they forget.”It’s a brutal alchemy, when men die on stag dos: a life-affirming celebration combusts into death. Tough questions need to be asked. What is it about our society that requires men to perform masculinity according to rigid protocols that result in physical injury or worse? And why do we laud men for adhering to these rituals? I read one satirical article that sums up this approving spirit: “Prince Harry’s stag do likely to end in at least one death.”Liam Colgan is still missing. Eamonn returned to Hamburg to search for him. “The wedding won’t go ahead without Liam,” he tells me. “We have to find him soon and get him home.”While some search for their loved ones, and others fight the authorities for justice, for those left back home, life returns to normal – almost. “Everything changes. It’s a different life,” Mike Rutter tells me. “It doesn’t matter what you do. He’s not coming back. That’s probably the worst part.”Rutter is back at the boxing gym that he and Luke Rhoden used to frequent. For a long time, he stayed away. “I couldn’t go back. I’m back now. I’ve gone back to boxing, finally. It’s good. Things are good.”For reasons he can’t even fully understand, Rutter has started racing motorbikes. “Luke always used to say this phrase: ‘Life’s for living.’ And for some reason I’ve started racing motorbikes. I don’t even know why. People say it’s stupid, but life is short.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc297a4da67185e9e41ae0528092c7efc6a417c2/336_0_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=18f59b45de26154d63bc0a5a60ab13eb 1240w","title":"an oasis of calm quaker groups 30 minutes of silence podcast","story":"Podcast of quiet Nottingham group gathering, inspired by BBC’s ‘slow radio’ season, clocks 400 tune-insIt’s not the most obvious subject for a podcast, but a group of young Quakers in Nottingham have recorded their 30-minute silent meeting so as to share their “oasis of calm” with the world.In an episode of the monthly Young Quaker Podcast, called the Silence Special, you can hear a clock ticking, pages being turned and the rain falling, as the group meets and sits in silence at the Friend’s Meeting House in Nottingham. Quakerism was founded in the 17th century by the dissenter George Fox during the years of Puritan England. The group’s meetings are characterised by silence, which is occasionally broken when someone present feels the urge to speak, say a prayer or offer a reading. The idea for the silent podcast first came from Tim Gee, a Quaker living in London, who was inspired by the BBC’s season of “slow” radio, which treated audiences to – among other things – the sounds of birds singing, mountain climbing and monks chatting. Gee said he had wanted to “share a small oasis of calm, and a way to provide a moment of stillness, for people on the move”.Jessica Hubbard-Bailey, 25, from the Nottingham Young Quakers, who recorded the podcast, said they had jumped at the opportunity to broadcast something “immersive and unusual”. She added: “We have very different ways of worship to most people of faith and we thought this was a really unique opportunity to give people a little slice of what the Quakers do. Also, we are really good at being quiet because we’ve made a practice of it and I think that is of value. These days everyone is so busy, everyone is working all the time, so it’s really valuable to have the opportunity to sit down once a week and just be quiet and listen.”Hubbard-Bailey, who was brought up as an atheist but became attracted to Quakerism for its egalitarian principles, said that the podcast had had a good reception, with nearly 400 uses of it. “I think that makes it the biggest Quaker meeting this year technically,” she said. “I’ve had one couple say that they’ve listened to the silence episode and are going to go to a Quaker meeting for the first time this Sunday. We’ve also had some people saying ‘oh, I’m not sure about this, seems like a bit of a waste of time’. But I think that’s really indicative of how we as a society view silence and stillness.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44bf52c3463457e906b39342c78ec9e72777bc7d/32_0_3437_2062/master/3437.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a6942c128f7437ddfb7a0a0bd423ae67 1240w","title":"uk government aims to streamline property sales with new measures","story":"Professional qualifications for estate agents and protection from gazumping among plansEstate agents will be required to obtain a professional qualification and disclose payments for referring customers to solicitors, surveyors or mortgage brokers under government plans aimed at streamline property sales.The measures announced by the housing secretary, Sajid Javid, will also discourage agents from taking part in gazumping, whereby higher offers are accepted after a deal has already been agreed.Promoted as a means of improving professionalism and cracking down on “rogue agents”, the reforms follow a consultation on how to improve the process of buying and selling property. There are about 20,000 estate agent companies in England and anyone can practice as an estate agent. Javid said buyers and sellers had been trapped in a stressful system full of delays and uncertainty for too long. “We will require estate agents to hold a qualification so that people are no longer at risk from a minority of ‘rogue agents’ and can trust the process when buying or selling their home,” he said. Mark Hayward, the chief executive of NAEA Propertymark, which represents estate agents, welcomed the commitment to further regulation. “We have long argued that estate agents should be recognised as professionals. This is an important step towards achieving this and we look forward to working with the government,” he said. The proposals from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government involve encouraging the use of voluntary reservation agreements to help prevent sales falling through and reduce gazumping.The new measures will also involve setting a timeline for local authority searches so buyers find the information they need within 10 days, and requiring managing agents and freeholders to provide up-to-date lease information for a set fee. An agreed timetable, it is hoped, will end the situation where leaseholders are at the mercy of freeholders and their agents.The government also intends to strengthen the National Trading Standards Estate Agency Team so that it can carry out more enforcement action, such as banning agents. Guides on how to buy and how to sell will be published to ensure customers are better informed about the process and know what questions they should be asking.

The neglect is now a thing of the past. This performance was at least its third professional outing in London in the last decade. The revival of interest tells us something about this ambitious piece’s enduring capacity to fascinate. But so does the earlier neglect. Mass is a problem piece for a reason.Actually, it’s for several reasons. There is the vast challenge of staging the unruly “theatre piece for singers, players and dancers”, which dramatises the crisis of faith in anguished times in music of many genres, all woven around the Latin mass. Nearly 500 are involved in Jude Kelly’s reworked 2010 production in the Festival Hall, with Marin Alsop again holding everything together. But Mass requires more than the enthusiasm of its performers. It is very episodic, uneven in musical quality and, culturally and politically, a period piece. Kelly’s attempt to draw modern political parallels overstretches it, and the relentless positivity of the evening cannot disguise the fact that Mass is a failure, though a heroic one.But it’s a blast, that’s for sure. And intermittently something more. Alsop’s meticulous commitment ensured utterly engaged playing and singing from the National Youth Orchestra, the Chineke! Junior orchestra and an array of far-flung young and adult performers, including a marching band. The Brazilian baritone Paulo Szot was tireless in the role of the Celebrant, who abandons his faith at the climax of the evening’s most dramatic scene. Mass is essential listening for anyone interested in Bernstein’s lifelong attempts to weave the popular and art music traditions together. One just wishes it was a more persuasive achievement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c3cab9e4b3778b8061a5127f8d61aa522684d0/0_0_2763_1658/master/2763.jpg?w=2750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55771385718cd1a0c19c8e99b6216ca3 5500w","title":"british jazz invasion moses boyd matthew halsall nubya garcia","story":"The UK is home to a erse, collaborative and newly confident jazz scene. We meet seven musicians whose innovative sounds are liberating the genre for new audiencesby  Kate Hutchinson. Photographs by  Antonio Olmos for the ObserverEvery so often, British jazz pops its head above the parapet, gets a Mercury nomination, and has a noodle on telly to remind everyone that it’s still there, like it’s always been, parping away from mainstream view. For many of us, jazz has seemed like something other people listened to. But in the past few years, the genre has had a serious overhaul. When Kendrick Lamar released his landmark album To Pimp a Butterfly in 2015, one of its most extraordinary aspects was its liberal use of jazz, which dovetailed with hip-hop and opened it up for a new generation. Not only did it immediately feel more accessible but, played by the likes of strikingly cosmic characters such as Thundercat and Kamasi Washington, it looked commandingly cool.In the UK, a new and thrilling jazz movement has evolved. As with Lamar, Thundercat and Washington, it is born out of fresh experimentalism, is reaching far younger, more erse audiences and doesn’t care for snootiness. Unlike in previous waves, these musicians are in their 20s and early 30s, come from erse backgrounds and, as with grime, have created their own community outside of major labels and concert halls. Their music, meanwhile, pulls liberally from other genres, whether hip-hop, neo-soul, UK club sounds such as broken beat, or from the African and Caribbean diaspora. And it’s not just at gigs that you can hear it but, much like in the acid jazz days, nightclubs too. British DJs such as Bradley Zero and Floating Points have liberated jazz for the dancefloor to the extent that it’s now not unheard of for a 10-minute Pharaoh Sanders odyssey to be spun on the decks to an appreciative, twentysomething crowd.Notable, too, is how prolific this wave is, with jazz musicians infiltrating summer music festival listings, signing to indie labels or taking their sound abroad. The sheer volume of talent is being recognised across the world. “Wherever I’m travelling, whether it’s in the States, Argentina, Japan, or all over Europe, everyone is talking to me about the British invasion,” says DJ and broadcaster Gilles Peterson, who himself helped usher in the acid jazz sound of the mid-80s. “I’ve had people talking about Courtney Pine and Steve Williamson in slightly hushed tones, but I’ve never had this before. They feel this is a very important movement.”The movement hasn’t just sprung out of nowhere. In London especially there is the sense that today’s jazz musicians have come up together over the past few years. They are collaborative, constantly threading through one another’s projects, and jamming together at a number of DIY stomping grounds, including the Church of Sound in an east London chapel and Dalston’s Total Refreshment Centre. South of the river, where much of the capital’s abundant scene has coalesced, music nights Steez and weekly Afrofuturism session Steam Down – recently attended by Kamasi Washington – are where players team up and try out new material. Broadcaster Teju Adeleye says: “The artists don’t feel like inaccessible superstars, they come to all the gigs and jam nights.”Adeleye is one of the new crop of radio hosts who are supporting jazz’s rising stars on internet stations such as NTS and Worldwide FM. “Having affordable spaces where people can go and experiment in front of audiences is important,” she says. “It fosters something genuine in a city where so much is driven by corporate ventures.” Also crucial are the jam sessions and artist development charities that have nurtured many of the new wave. These include Tomorrow’s Warriors, at London’s Southbank Centre, whose ethos is to support the development of jazz newbies, especially women and musicians of colour. It’s an ethos shared by Jazz re:freshed, Justin McKenzie and Adam Moses’s promotions company turned label, which has played a huge part in supporting new jazz, whether giving musicians a stage in the UK or overseas.Perhaps what’s most exciting, though, is the sense that this generation is wresting jazz from its gatekeepers and making it their own. With this scene, says Adeleye, “not everyone is classically or formally trained”, and as a result “there’s an accessible, anti‑hero energy that feels like sweet vindication for a music that should be for everyone, but has felt locked away and preserved only for a few. They’ve liberated the sound.”Soweto Kinch, an established saxophonist who runs Birmingham-based jam session The Live Box, agrees. “Genre boundaries are more fluid,” he says. “There’s less kowtowing to the jazz police.” The UK’s next-gen jazzers have an important confidence and it’s bolstered by the fact that their audience want to hear something original. It’s why Kinch hopes this jazz wave won’t end up being a wave at all, but will be here to stay: “It’s music of quality and of longevity it’s not disposable new music,” he says. Peterson agrees: “This lot are all doing original music, and that’s a really important sign. The last thing jazz needs is another version of Summertime or Feeling Good. Just make original music – that’s what people want.”London-based drummer, composer and producer, 26“I’ve been in Cape Town and people are talking about what’s going on here,” says Moses Boyd of the London jazz scene, which he has played a central role in shaking up and making new over the past few years. “In New York and at South by Southwest, people stop me in the street and show interest. It’s definitely a good time.”You can hear this very clearly in Boyd’s 2017 solo EP Absolute Zero, which fuses live jazz drumming with synthesised sounds and grime rhythms. Even his more straightforward jazz tracks have the potential to fill dancefloors. When he recorded Rye Lane Shuffle in 2016, Boyd sent it to his mentor Sam Shepherd, AKA DJ and producer Floating Points. “Before I knew it, Sam had cut a dubplate and was sending me videos of him spinning it across the world. Suddenly my inbox was filling with DJs asking, ‘Where can I get this?’ That was a big shift for me.”These days Boyd is surrounded by jazz musicians with a similarly open-minded approach to genre and process, but 10 years ago, when he started playing around London, things felt very different. “There was a big audience but it wasn’t really people like me. The jazz world felt very separate.”Touring with Soweto Kinch and meeting Gilles Peterson helped Boyd find his own way. “Seeing how Gilles used jazz in club culture, the dots all started to connect for me. I was like, ‘there is a place for the music I’ve been hearing in my head’. Because it’s easy to get disillusioned: maybe it’s just me, maybe I’m in the wrong country, maybe I’m some alien planted here. But gradually it started to click.”Another big influence on the current sound, Boyd says, is London itself and its vibrant sound‑system culture. “I think London is a unique place, a very culturally integrated place,” he says. “You walk down the street and hear 10 different languages being spoken and that’s not strange. That definitely seeps into the music.”Interview by Killian FoxMoses Boyd plays at the Love Supreme jazz festival, Glynde, East Sussex, 29 June-1 July London-based bandleader and saxophone and clarinet player, 33Shabaka Hutchings is easily one of the most interesting bandleaders of the past decade. He deals in shape-shifting sax and clarinet, but it’s his carefree approach to other genres that’s established him as a musical outlier who’s rattling rigid jazz traditions. His three projects, Shabaka and the Ancestors, Sons of Kemet and The Comet Is Coming – the latter a nominee in the Mercury’s “token jazz category”, he jokes – are peppered variously with calypso, dub, Afrofuturist beats and hat-tips to Sun Ra, Miles Davis and sweat‑soaked New Orleans party music.Trumpeter and Gondwana label boss, Matthew Halsall, calls Hutchings “the Kamasi Washington of the UK jazz scene” and it’s easy to see why. Hutchings – who is from Birmingham by way of Barbados, where he lived till he was 16 – is a similarly gifted brass player, has a commanding presence, and comes with a penchant for all things cosmic. He is also as ubiquitous, having played with the likes of mid-00s breakthroughs Melt Yourself Down, Ethio-jazz pioneer Mulatu Astatke and Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, on the latter’s soundtrack for Paul Thomas Anderson’s film The Master.Hutchings is also helping to document the scene, and last month oversaw We Out Here, a compilation that spotlights south London’s rising stars. He gathered together Maisha, Ezra Collective, Moses Boyd, Theon Cross, Nubya Garcia, Triforce, Joe Armon-Jones and Kokoroko and recorded them over three days of jamming last year. He says of these musicians that, much like him, “the differences in the generation now and generations past is that it feels like young musicians aren’t trying to satisfy the standards that were set by jazz in the past. They’re just going, ‘What is the music that represents me today?’”This generation are bringing with them a younger audience, though it tickles Hutchings because, at 33, he’s old enough to remember “the time where jazz wasn’t cool at all. If you said, ‘I play jazz’, people were just like, ‘Oh no, that’s terrible’.” But he suggests that jazz will continue to innovate regardless of trends. Like punk, “it’s an attitude of, ‘Fuck it, we’re doing something that’s probably not going to be popular anyway’. Jazz is that music that no one’s expecting to go anywhere, and the musicians are just getting on with it.”Interview by Kate HutchinsonYour Queen Is a Reptile by Sons of Kemet is out now on Impulse!If there is a movement happening in the UK, says Sheila Maurice-Grey, then it’s not limited to jazz alone, it’s a “new wave of British culture”. The 27-year-old trumpeter and visual artist grew up in Vauxhall, south-west London, her mother from Sierra Leone, her father from Guinea Bissau and her stepfather from South Africa and Zimbabwe. She says that heritages such as hers – “this idea that I’m British, but I’ll never be classed as English” – is “what’s adding to the scene everyone keeps talking about”. She and her peers are changing things up because they are “taking from different aspects of their culture and making it a British thing”.Maurice-Grey was encouraged to pick up her instrument by the late Mat Fox, who as well as being her music teacher also ran the carnival band-style youth project Kinetika Bloco. She was inspired to hold her own masterclasses as part of Kinetika, called Bloco Lates, because “it’s important to always be aware of the people coming behind you”. Kinetika is also where the west African influences in her band, Kokoroko, have come from. She met their percussionist, Onome Ighamre, during a musical project in Kenya and the two were “complaining to each other that there are so many Afrobeat bands in the UK that perform for people that don’t look like us”. They decided to start a group to challenge that and represent “the idea of being young, black and British”.Yazmin Lacey didn’t exactly elbow her way into a career as a singer of smoky, soulful jazz music she had to be enticed. Growing up in a musical family in east London, she had a strong singing voice but never felt inclined to show it off. Shortly after moving to Nottingham in 2013, she let her guard down. “I’d had a lot to drink,” she laughs. “Someone persuaded me to sing. Then this girl came over and said, ‘Oh my gosh, I run this acoustic night, do you want to perform?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, take my number.’Gradually, while working at a children’s charity by day, Lacey built up a repertoire and a following. Performing at a night organised by Gilles Peterson’s Brownswood Recordings brought her to the attention of Future Bubblers, the label’s talent discovery scheme, and she was accepted on to the year-long development programme in 2015. It connected her with like-minded musicians and set her up to release an assured, richly melodic EP called Black Moon last summer. A second EP, 90 Degrees, is out on 19 May.Though her music blurs genres, including R\u0026ampB, soul, reggae and even garage, the 29-year-old feels especially connected to the resurgent British jazz scene – she cites Ezra Collective, Nubya Garcia and Shabaka Hutchings as inspirations. “I think there’s an undercurrent of everybody speaking their truth now,” she says, “and for me that’s what jazz means. It’s rebellion music, there are no rules. You sing from the heart, tell the stories that are real, say what you see, what’s going on in society. There’s a strength in that.”She finds strength, too, in collaborating with other musicians. “My guitarist said something that really stuck with me: when it was just the two of us, the music sounded so lonely and delicate, but play the same song now with a band and it sounds really powerful. That’s jazz in action: people connecting and talking about what’s real.” KFManchester-based trumpeter, composer, arranger and bandleader, and founder of  Gondwana Records, 34Manchester may be best known for its wayward rave days, but Matthew Halsall has more recently helped to put the city on the jazz map. A trumpeter from the age of six, he grew up in a mill town near Wigan and balances music-making with running Gondwana Records, the label he started 10 years ago to capture the cross-pollination of jazz with hip-hop, trip-hop, classical and electronic styles that was happening live on stage at a Manchester haunt called Matt \u0026amp Phred’s.The venue was a hub for acts such as the Cinematic Orchestra, hosting jam sessions where Halsall, now 34, was able to play alongside local A-listers including Nat Birchall, Jon Thorne and Chip Wickham. Inspired by their shared sensibilities, he began building his own collective, explaining how “all the early Gondwana releases were the same group of Manchester’s most interesting musicians performing together on each other’s records”.The sound they’ve developed references the ruminative approach of John and Alice Coltrane – but it’s also distinctively northern and, says Gilles Peterson, “beautifully delicate”.“Someone wrote that it has a ‘rain-stricken spiritual jazz feel to it’,” says Halsall. “It’s definitely different to the London scene. In some ways it’s more mellow and floaty. The people I work with are quite spiritual and into meditation, and a lot of them live in the countryside, so they are very chilled out.”Meditation in particular, he says, is “ingrained in the music”, Halsall having attended the Maharishi Free School in West Lancashire, which teaches a “consciousness-based education”. These days, though, he is “more interested in the exciting movement of a larger number of people”, adding that jazz has “always been greater than the sum of its parts”. It’s why he started the Gondwana Orchestra, an official ensemble of his regular players, who’ll be performing as part of the label’s 10th anniversary festival at London’s Roundhouse in October, alongside established minimalists Portico Quartet and north African‑inspired Norwich newcomers Mammal Hands, who have also recently released music on the label.Back in Manchester, Halsall says, there is a “massive demand” for jazz, with his early discovery and last year’s Mercury prize nominees GoGo Penguin due to play the city’s Albert Hall in November. And it continues to evolve, too. “The hip-hop scene in Manchester has brought in a lot of jazz recently, and when I go out on weekends it’s amazing now how many DJs will be playing jazz records.” Being a hometown hero, even an unassuming one in a flat cap and cardigan, does he get stopped on the street? “Yeah, yeah I do,” he says. “You wouldn’t think that was possible in the jazz world. But people are really into it now.” KHGondwana 10 is at the Roundhouse, London NW1, on 10 OctoberWhen Theon Cross was eight, his parents signed him and his brother Nathaniel up for brass lessons at school in Nunhead, south London. Nathaniel chose the trombone, and now he’s a prominent trombonist on the London jazz scene. Theon, meanwhile, picked up a French horn. Later he progressed to the euphonium and eventually, when he was big enough to grapple with it, a tuba. Now Cross’s tuba playing underscores some of most exciting UK jazz records of the past few years, including Rye Lane Shuffle by Moses Boyd and the last two albums by Sons of Kemet, as well as his own highly accomplished Aspirations EP from 2015.The largest and lowest-pitched member of the brass family may seem an odd presence on a London jazz stage – you’re far more likely to see it in marching bands or classical orchestras – but Cross reminds me that “the tuba was actually the first bass in jazz. When they were recording for gramophones, the tuba was the only instrument loud enough to be picked up, so they used it instead of the double bass. It’s been at the forefront right from the start.”Now Cross is making it a fixture of the new London jazz sound. “It’s an anchor for music, it’s got so much power,” he says. “I’m quite a reserved, quiet guy and I’m amplified by that instrument.” Recently he’s been playing with the London rapper Kano, who features a brass section in his live show. “When I come out at Glastonbury with my tuba, people are like, ‘What’s that about?’ But when they hear me doubling the bassline, they’re like,” – he widens his eyes and nods his head – “‘OK!’”Cross credits much of his success to good music teachers at school and free workshops around London supported by now-dwindling arts funding. As a teenager, he played with Kinetika Bloco, a youth performance group that runs a summer school at the Southbank Centre. “We’d be playing the Notting Hill carnival or Thames festival and marching for hours,” he says. This prepared him for Sons of Kemet’s frenetic live shows where he plays “intensely with two drummers for an hour and a half. That requires real stamina.”Much of the year ahead will be given over to Sons of Kemet – he’s just got back from playing with them in São Paulo – but he also needs to clear some space for his own music: he’s releasing a new single in October, with an album to follow around the end of the year.Clearly, committing to an unusual instrument has not served him badly in the London jazz world. “I’ve been lucky with the tuba,” says Cross. “I’ve always gravitated towards it since I was young. It wasn’t really a choice: I’d say the tuba picked me.” KFLondon-based saxophonist and composer, 26As one of the few female brass players at the forefront of contemporary jazz, Nubya Garcia is familiar with challenging expectations. “People do look at you, and it used to bother me a lot, but I’m trying to learn how to deal with it,” she says. “If you get comments like ‘Whoa, it’s so nice to see a woman on stage’ every time you gig, which I do, eventually you’re like, ‘Godammit!’ It’s not a negative thing, it’s just that person one doesn’t know that person 30 is also saying that. It’s just normal to me, but not normal to everyone else.”Garcia, 26, from Camden, north London, graduated from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance two years ago and since then her career as a saxophonist and composer has taken off. She got back a few days ago from playing taste-making Texas festival South by Southwest, where she was a little unprepared for the demand. “This huge queue of people followed me outside to buy my vinyl,” she says. “I was like, ‘fuck, I’ve only got 11’.” That record was last month’s When We Are, a solo EP laced with jazz, gospel, neo-soul and the electronic touches she picked up under the tutelage of the jazzdance producer Floating Points. She has also soundtracked a current touring production of A Streetcar Named Desire and she’s part of spiritual jazz-inspired ensemble Maisha. And with Nérija, the collective she is in alongside Sheila Maurice-Grey, she’s just signed her first record deal with indie label Domino."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47c204947a9b3117a705e0e5d693490b93e33ee9/0_180_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=af49fb4721939ece37f3ee2242a664a4 1240w","title":"firms touted as top employers for women pay them less than men","story":"Almost half of companies listed as best places to work as a woman report gender pay gap greater than national averageAlmost half of the companies included on a list of businesses feted as the best places to work as a woman in the UK have a gender pay gap higher than the national average, exclusive Guardian analysis has revealed.Analysis also shows that more than four in 10 FTSE 100 companies, based on subsidiaries which were required to report, have a gender pay gap higher than the national average and nine in 10 report they pay women less than men on average.The figures were revealed as businesses published the difference between what they pay men and women for the first time on 4 April. More than 10,000 companies reported figures with almost 300 subsidiaries of FTSE 100 companies among those reporting. Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society said the gender pay gap was a complex indicator of inequality in the workplace. “Even good employers can have significant pay gaps,” she said. “What matters is their action plan to tackle it and deal with any inequality they find.”All companies and some public sector bodies in Great Britain, except Northern Ireland, with more than 250 employees had to\u0026nbspreport their gender pay gap to the Government Equalities Office. All companies were due to report by 4 April 2018.Commonly known as the average, the mean is calculated by adding up the wages of all employees and iding that figure by the number of employees. The mean gender pay gap is the difference between mean male pay and mean female pay.The median gap is the difference between the employee in the middle of the range of male wages and the employee in the middle of the range of female wages. Typically the median is the more representative figure, because the mean can be skewed by a handful of highly paid employees.“Women are afraid to speak up because they’re dismissed or made to feel silly. I spoke up, and got given advice by two separate senior people to stop talking about the gender pay gap,” she said.Most large companies, including many on the Times Top 50 and FTSE 100, reported multiple subsidiaries with more than 250 employees. The Guardian’s analysis is based on the subsidiaries with the largest reported median hourly pay gap as of 6 April. 13 FTSE 100 companies did not publish figures as they do not have enough UK-based employees to be required to report their pay gap.Companies on the Times list are self-nominated by submitting a 5,000 word report which is then “marked against a framework of best practice”.Five JP Morgan subsidiaries reported an average gender pay gap worse than the national average. In its gender pay gap report the company laid out a range on policies in place including recruitment and targets at VP and ED level.A spokeswoman for Business in the Community, which compiles the Times’ list, said it did not specifically ask about the size of a company’s gender pay gap, but focused on the companies’ actions. “Companies in the Top 50 have proven they are taking action to address inequalities such as fewer women going into certain industries, lower pay due to working part-time, or having taken a career break, as well as unconscious bias and discrimination, personal choice and corporate culture,” said a spokeswoman. “Of course, we want to see impact and culture change, and we would expect to see everyone’s gender pay gap improve over time.”Karen Gill, co-founder of Everywoman, which aims to advance women in business, said companies needed to take bolder action.“They are taking steps and they are making progress, but the things that need to change are not quick fixes,” she said. “That doesn’t mean they are not good places to work – or at least better than others – it just means they are not going fast enough.”If companies failed to take action, they would face the consequences, she added.“Women are going to use this tool. It’s a talent game, and they won’t get the best talent unless they deal with it.”Additional reporting Joseph Scott Davies and Giacomo Boscaini-Gilroy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e4a07efc6214bcbd69f8d19b37316e2d2571e87/137_0_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?w=5250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=784e45bc9fa4e87160287f679feb49af 10500w","title":"way of grief and park life fridays best photos","story":"The Guardian’s picture editors bring you a selection of photo highlights from around the world including Orthodox Christians marking Good Friday and reaction to a former South Korean president’s prison term"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e73503eacccd15bceab5b9e8ea8bde2b62893a1e/0_41_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=130efc13a017f3c3c35a6879ee068700 1240w","title":"a daft waste of time labour pours scorn on new centrist party","story":"John McDonnell and other senior figures dismiss plans for movement said to have secured £50mSenior figures in the Labour party including John McDonnell have poured scorn on plans for a new centrist political party that is said to have secured £50m from financial backers, including the multimillionaire founder of LoveFilm.The movement, spearheaded by the former Labour donor Simon Franks and revealed by the Observer, has been secretly under development for more than a year and involves entrepreneurs, philanthropists and benefactors keen to break the Westminster mould.There has been persistent speculation about the potential for a new party as Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership has taken Labour to the left, while the Conservatives’ approach to Brexit has alienated some on that party’s modernising wing. The Liberal Democrats have so far failed to take advantage of the polarisation.But the plans for a new centrist party were dismissed by Labour shadow cabinet members, with the shadow chancellor tweeting: “That’s a novel idea. A party of the rich, by the rich, for the rich. A party for the few not the many.”The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said: “For goodness sake, what a daft waste of time. Anyone putting money into this nonsense would be better off investing in our campaign to restore and rebuild our NHS.”Jon Trickett tweeted: “A new political party with £50m in the kitty, no members, no rule book, no ideology. Perhaps with support from sections of the British Establishment. A plaything for the rich? Let’s focus on the task in hand: building a social movement which will change our country for good.”Other Labour MPs also reacted with disdain. The MP for Norwich South, Clive Lewis, describing the new movement as an “establishment reboot job” for a “failed ideology”. Manchester Central’s Lucy Powell said: “Sounds like a bad idea, over-hyped.”The plan was even criticised by the arch-Blairite Lord Adonis, who was among those who formed the Social Democratic party in 1981. He said: “Labour and the Labour movement is the only means to defeat Brexit and bring about a radical reforming government. Believe me, I was a founder member of the SDP: it failed and we can’t fail this time, the stakes for the country are too high”. The movement, the latest in a line of new centrist parties but the only one to have such substantial financial backing, is understood to have been drawn up by a group frustrated by the tribal nature of politics, the polarisation caused by Brexit and the standard of political leadership on all sides.It appears to have a centre-left policy platform that borrows ideas from both left and right, including asking the rich to pay a fairer share of tax and better funding for the NHS, as well as ideas on wealth creation and tighter immigration controls.Franks, a philanthropist and businessman, has set up a company, Project One Movement for the UK, which is likely to be the vehicle for the enterprise. It is unclear whether the project will concentrate on funding community activism or becoming a formal political party. Senior figures from business and charity are understood to be involved, as well as former supporters of the main parties, including a number of former Tory donors. However, it is not yet trying to convince MPs to defect.The project appears to be the most significant attempt yet to challenge the main parties, joining a field including the anti-Brexit party Renew and grassroots activists’ party Advance. However, Britain’s electoral system and the reluctance of existing politicians to make the jump make it difficult to succeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cce2a7fb0ef580846c95521e9495934a527a444f/0_2_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b073101795123c32e3f30341f4b171a0 1240w","title":"ukip investigates peterborough candidates twitter history","story":"Tweets reportedly posted by Massimo Pinto, which date back to 2012 and 2013, are sexually explicit and misogynisticUkip is investigating misogynistic and sexually explicit tweets reportedly posted by one of its candidates in next month’s elections for Peterborough city council. The tweets were in the timeline of Massimo Pinto, candidate for the Paston ward and a leading pro-Brexit campaigner in the area.The tweets, which date back to 2012 and 2013, are highly sexually explicit as well as misogynistic. One tweet also includes the hashtag “Peterborough #PlacesToNeverEverVisit”.The embarrassment comes as Ukip struggles to survive as a political force. Last month it lost a costly legal dispute and was left with over £100,000 of costs that threatened its solvency. Last week it announced that it had raised the funds through one-off donations from members. It also claimed to have collected £300,000 in a membership fundraising drive. In another cost-saving exercise, acting party leader Gerard Batten will stay on for at least a year to avoid the expense of a leadership contest. Batten is the fifth acting or elected Ukip leader since the Brexit referendum in 2016.In many parts of England in next month’s local elections, Ukip is understood to be running only a shadow campaign, contesting few of the approximately 4,000 seats. According to the Conservative election expert Robert Hayward, Ukip is hardly represented in some of the parts of England where it performed strongly ahead of the referendum. “In Sunderland, Hyndburn, Nuneaton and Fareham they are fielding either no candidates or one or two. In each of the authorities named, they fielded either a full slate of candidates in 2014 or virtually a full slate,” said Hayward.However, in Peterborough, Ukip has 13 candidates standing for 18 of the city council wards. More recently on Pinto’s account – which he has now locked – are pictures of the Ukip candidate at the start of the referendum campaign in 2016 with then Conservative MP Stewart Jackson.Ukip said they would look into the tweets. “The lad is deeply ashamed and embarrassed,” said a spokesman. “He can’t remember doing it, but he doesn’t claim he didn’t. It’s deeply unedifying and unpleasant, there’s no question about that, but it was six years ago. He’s terribly embarrassed and ashamed, as rightly he should be.”Pinto was vetted by the party before being approved as a candidate. The Ukip spokesman claimed Pinto had also passed Conservative vetting processes.Nominations for the elections closed on Friday and technically it is now impossible for a candidate to withdraw.

Get set with everything from advice on finding your feline friend and turning your pad into a puss-worthy palace to grooming and getting them ready for the outside world. They grow up so fast …Getting you and your pad kitten-ready need not be a drama, as long as you get to grips with just what they need to feel safe and secure. Understanding how young cats work is the key to making their transition from kittenhood to a much-loved family member as smooth as possible.“Do you need eyes in the back of your head? Maybe,” laughs registered feline behaviourist, Lucy Hoile. “But knowing how a kitten matures helps us understand their behaviour, which means fewer surprises (hopefully) and you can build a solid foundation for a lifetime of wonderful feline companionship.”Finding your new kittenIf you are responding to an advert for a kitten, there are a few pointers to be aware of to ensure you are buying from a reputable breeder.“Unlike dog breeding, there isn’t the same legislation in place for cats, so it’s best to ensure you can see the mother and her litter,” explains Hoile. “Expect to be asked a lot of information about your home setup – a caring breeder will want to know where their kitten is going.”Equally, most animal shelters have lots of unwanted kittens that need rehoming, so it is often a great place to start your search. Try the RSPCA, Cats Protection League, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home or Blue Cross for more information.Prepping your padInside, tape up any gaps that could intrigue your new kitten, such as that tiny space in between your washing machine and tumble dryer. “It’s incredible the tiny gaps your kitten can squeeze through, so better safe than sorry,” says Hoile. “Kittens are programmed to explore – they’re hunters by nature, so every new thing is an adventure. In these early weeks they have less fear than when they are a little older – they really are fearless.”You may also have noticed by now that cats can climb, so don’t presume your fencing will retain them. Kittens won’t be as strong, but they can still scale a decent height. Ensure you can keep your kitten in until they have had their first set of vaccinations (about eight weeks), before letting them explore the area around their new manor.Tip: Discuss neutering with your vet as soon as you bring your cat home – a female cat can get pregnant at around six months and an unneutered Tom is not an ideal family pet.Getting the right kitWhen it comes to shopping, less is generally more, but some specific kit is essential for settling in a kitten. “You do need to buy kitten-sized kit,” advises Hoile. “It may sound obvious but a high-sided litter tray will prevent a kitten from using it, the wrong-sized litter will be sore on a kitten’s paws and a food bowl that’s too deep will deter it from feeding adequately,” advises Hoile.As a starter kit you will need:“Buying a climbingscratchinghiding kit might seem excessive, but it’s not,” says Hoile. “Kittens climb, explore and want to hone their physical ability, if they don’t have something to climb they will shoot up your curtains, along your carpet, round your sofa … they’re programmed to train their bodies, so they need an outlet to do it.”Feeding“Kittens need to be fed little and often,” says Hoile. “Ask your breeder what foods your kitten has been used to and follow suit, making sure it is age and weight appropriate. If in doubt, ask your vet.”Myth buster: kittens and cats should not be given cow’s milk. “They can’t tolerate it and it’s a myth they crave it,” says Hoile. “Kittens and cats need fresh water in the wild they would drink from fresh running water, so they prefer to drink water fresh from the tap. Wet food is good for cats as it contains water – cats need water in their diet as they often have kidney and urine issues in later life without adequate quantities.”Worming and vaccinationsA responsible breeder or animal shelter will already have wormed your cat or will raise the issue of vaccinations with you.“Once you have your kitten, book a visit to your vet as soon as possible. Many vets hold kitten days now, they will check your kitten’s health and weight and advise on the worming, flea and vaccination programme. It is also a great way for your kitten to get accustomed to a vet’s visit. The more they are exposed to as kittens, the easier they will be to handle as adults.”GroomingGrooming isn’t just for a sleek coat, it also helps us get to know our cat’s physical shape and allows us to spot any health issues as soon as possible. Short-haired cats need grooming once a week to ensure the coat is kept free of dead hair and it helps you to bond with your cat. Longer-haired cats, such as persians, need to be groomed daily.“Otherwise, the damage to their coat and their skin can be devastating,” says Hoile. “Long-haired varieties very quickly get matted and this causes problems that go beyond just a matted coat – it can lead to skin infections and more.”House-trainingIf you get your kitten at between eight and 12 weeks, they will probably have been litter trained already.“Provide a kitten-friendly tray, with kitten-sized litter and ensure it is kept clean and accessible at all times,” says Hoile. “If your kitten isn’t using it, chances are it’s not big enough, not clean enough, or the litter is either a) too highly scented or b) too big for the kitten to rake easily.”Cats are very clean animals by nature. Once your kitten is old enough to go outside, move the litter tray outside during the day and, at night, leave a clean litter tray by the door.Going outsideYour kitten should be vaccinated before it ventures outside under supervision. International Cat Care recommends your kitten is four months old and also neutered before going into the great outdoors on its own. Most vets will microchip your kitten when they are neutered, before then a kitten safety collar with a name tag is a good idea just in case they escape – and it’s not the worst idea to keep a safety collar with a home address disc on, especially in these early days. When they are ready to go outside, monitor short trips into and around the gardensurrounding spaces.Tips for a (relatively) stress-free first-timer:Of course, not all cats love the outdoors, some are happier as house cats – if you’re unsure what’s best for your cat, speak with your vet.Whether they’re in, out or – most likely – all about, an energetic new cat needs food tailored to them. Royal Canin provides nutritionally complete, age- and breed-specific diets for optimum feline health "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eb138382c40f5ef99e3ad5fa2111e7d65472c51/2050_515_2450_1470/master/2450.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a29aab7f02f647af0414e2b6f6d2d54e 1240w","title":"neuroscientist gregory berns studying dogs more enjoyable than studying himan","story":"Gregory Berns is a distinguished professor of neuroeconomics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. His current work involves taking brain scans of dogs to probe what goes on between canine ears, as well as using scanning techniques to probe the connections within brains of dead animals, including the extinct Tasmanian tiger, the thylacine. In your new book, you say a dog’s brain is about the size\u0026nbspof a lemon… That’s probably for a medium-size dog, like a labrador. Bigger dogs generally have bigger brains, so obviously you are not going to get a lemon inside a chihuahua’s head.What’s the rest made of? Is it just\u0026nbspair\u0026nbspbetween the ears? You are not far off. There is a lot of air in the skull, especially in the\u0026nbspfront between the eyes and above the nose, there is a big frontal\u0026nbspsinus and then around the\u0026nbspsides it is all muscle.Why did you want to look at the dog’s\u0026nbspbrain? It was an idea in search of a question\u0026nbspinitially. But one of the first\u0026nbspthings that I wanted to know was, if we are looking at dogs’ reward system – in terms of parts of their brain that are critical for motivation and, if you want to be a little philosophical about it, pleasure and what they like – do they hang around us humans just for food because we feed them or is\u0026nbspthere more to the dog-human bond than that?You said that you see a reward response in a dog’s brain to human odours and that is evidence of something like love. Could it not just be\u0026nbspan association with food? That finding by itself could be association. But it is not just any human because it was only the smell\u0026nbspof their human that triggered that response, so there is a recognition component there – but it still could be “Hey, this is the person who feeds me.” Which is why\u0026nbspwe did the other experiment of food versus praise, where we examined the response to the expectation of food versus the expectation of “Hey good girl!” We\u0026nbspfound most of the dogs had equal responses to both. One of the\u0026nbspbig messages I am trying to convey is that dogs are iniduals too and in every experiment that we have done we\u0026nbspsee a range of responses.The structure of a dog’s brain is rather different from a human’s – how far can we say there are analogous areas?That’s a good question. If you just look physically at the brain, there are obvious differences in size, so\u0026nbspimmediately there is a challenge there to identify corresponding parts\u0026nbspin one brain with another. Humans have proportionally much larger frontal lobes, so there is more\u0026nbspstuff there that a dog does not\u0026nbsphave. So it is problematic to say that regions are analogous just based on how they appear. But there\u0026nbspis a functional analogy, which is\u0026nbspreally what I am talking about. The\u0026nbspidea with a functional analogy\u0026nbspis,\u0026nbspif you have two iniduals, whether they are the same species or\u0026nbspnot, engaging in the\u0026nbspsame activity or the same task and you see a region of the brain that is active in the same condition in both\u0026nbspcases, then you would say they\u0026nbspare functionally analogous because they seem to be doing the same thing.Is this a big project in anthropomorphism? I don’t think so. I don’t claim dogs understand what we are saying the way we do. Some people are convinced their dogs understand what they are saying, but dogs don’t\u0026nbsphave the same amount of brain real estate for processing language that we do.There was a study recently about dogs manipulating their faces to communicate with humans. What do\u0026nbspyou make of that? Do they really pull\u0026nbspthe big eye stunt? Obviously they want to communicate with us because they live with us. They are very social\u0026nbspanimals in my view, their greatest trick is how social they are – that is what makes them a dog and not a wolf. But if a dog makes a particular facial expression, are we to conclude that they are trying to communicate with\u0026nbspus or not? I don’t know.When you look at a dog in an MRI scanner and you see activity in a region, do we know if that is down to thoughts, an impulse, inbuilt or training? What is the alternative if they don’t think? Then we are back to what essentially Descartes said, which is that animals have no thoughts, that they are just a bundle of reflexes. That would be a Cartesian view of animals that I\u0026nbspthink most people would not accept any more. Most scientists would not accept that. In part, that is because dogs and all animals have the ability to learn from the environment. They are at some level taking things into account, things that have happened to them, and altering their actions based on these things. To put it in words, they form predictions of how the world behaves around them and that includes other entities. To me, that is what thought is. Now the thing I think people get hung up on is that they don’t have an internal monologue like we do.Do you think dogs have an imagination? For sure. I think all animals have a form of imagination. I think one of the major functions of a brain is to, for lack of a better word, imagine. Now that may be a bit anthropomorphic for your tastes, so the other way to think about it is that brains are necessary for\u0026nbspprediction.There was one incident you talk about\u0026nbspwhere you had to kill a dog as\u0026nbsppart of your work... It wasn’t research, that was training as a medical doctor. It was just what all medical doctors had to do. Yeah, it left a lasting impression and I regret it greatly.Do you think some animals have lower sentience so it is OK to eat them? It is really tricky to kind of prioritise certain animals over other animals. At least in the western world, nobody\u0026nbspis going to eat a dog, but that doesn’t mean they are more sentient or more intelligent than other animals that we do eat – it is because they are charismatic and we like them. On the face of it, that doesn’t seem right.You talk about how in your experiments the dogs are not restrained but free to leave at any time, just as humans are. That is admirable, but how realistic an\u0026nbspapproach is that for medical\u0026nbspresearch? The problem with a lot of medical research is they use animals in ways\u0026nbspthat don’t even translate to human health. It is well known that\u0026nbsprat and mouse physiology and the way they react to drugs is not very predictive of how humans react\u0026nbspto drugs. So we do need to think seriously about the use of animals in\u0026nbspmedical research and whether it is really worth doing or\u0026nbspnot.Do you see yourself as a modern\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspDolittle? No, I didn’t think it was going to end\u0026nbspthis way, but it is more enjoyable than studying people.• What It’s Like to Be a Dog by Gregory Berns is published by Oneworld (£16.99).

The 27-year-old Texan has two putts to win the Masters! He hits a dribbler down the green ... and it misses on the right and sails three feet past. It’s not over quite yet. A short uphill one for the Masters, we’ve all dreamed of it ...Rory McIlroy finishes up first. A par to end a dismal round of 74. If only that eagle putt on 2 had dropped, this entire story could have been different. But his flat stick went cold, and he’s still got a Masters-shaped hole on his CV, and a green-jacket shaped gap in his wardrobe. He ends the week at -9.Reed lands his second onto the green from 166 yards. He pulled it slightly, and it’s stayed up on the higher back portion of the green. So he’s got a slippery downhill 30-footer left. But he’s got two putts for the Masters! The gallery rises to acclaim him. Their new champion? Reed should finish this off. He’s been so solid all day ... all week. But the pressure’s really on now.Rickie prowls around his putt, checking every angle. Finally he strikes it ... and knocks it straight into the cup! The birdie takes him past Jordan Spieth into second spot. A round of 67. He’s one behind Reed. Jon Rahm puts his name to a 69. And back on the tee, Reed clatters a final huge drive straight down the centre of the fairway. It briefly threatens to run into Lyle’s Bunker, but stops short. He’s one good iron shot and two putts away from becoming the 2018 Masters champion!Reed’s putt across 17 is the best part of 100 feet. He rattles it straight at the hole, and it hits the cup! It’s going too fast to drop, but the cup takes the pace off the ball and stops it six feet past. That’s a stroke of luck, but it’s reward for his positivity. And he rolls in the par saver, and he’s very close now. That’s a miracle two-putt from where he was! His name is surely on this Tournament ... unless Fowler can convert his birdie chance on 18 to put a little pressure on.Henrik Stenson finishes on a high, knocking his second to five feet and rolling in for birdie. That’s his third 70 on the bounce, to go with an opening-day 69, and he ends the week -9. Tommy Fleetwood finished with a very disappointing 74 he’s -4. They clear out of the way, to let Rickie Fowler send his final iron into the green. And it’s a peach, biting eight feet from the hole!Up on 18, the two-time champion Bubba Watson completes a very satisfactory week by signing for a 69. He’s -9 for the Tournament. Back on the tee, Fowler lashes an almost perfect drive down the centre of the fairway. And on 17, Reed’s second is not very good at all, only just creeping onto the front left of the green. The flag is all the way over on the other side, across a couple of ridges. That’ll test his putting touch.Fowler sends a nice putt up towards the hole from the fringe, but it’s never turning right as it needs to. He’ll have to make to with tidying up from three feet for par. Par for Rahm too. Back down the hole, Reed pushes his drive into the second cut down the right. He should be OK for his second shot, he’s not quite as wide as the row of trees. Fowler needs a birdie down the last, because Reed is closing in now. Reed thinks he’s made his birdie putt on 16, but it dies to the left at the very last turn. He stays two clear of Spieth and Fowler at -15, with two to play. Fowler needs a strong finish. But his second into 17 topples back off the front of the green. At the very least, he needs to get up and down, and see what happens down 18. “Nobody cavorts like Jack did,” declares Simon McMahon. “As distinctive in its own way as the raised arm of Denis Law or Joe Jordan, the raised finger of Dennis Taylor or Alex Higgins, the raised knee of Bruce Forsyth, the raised lip of Shakin’ Stevens, and the raised eyebrow of everyone’s favourite Bond, Roger Moore.”Reed looks determined to close this out. He fires his tee shot at 16 straight at the flag. It stops 15 feet short of the cup. A chance for birdie more importantly, there’s now no chance for watery disaster. He’s been magnificent today, holding the field at arm’s length for most of the afternoon, and pressing on the gas when Spieth momentarily caught him. He’s just got to keep calm and he should close this out. Though at the Masters, nothing’s ever certain until the cards are checked and signed.Reed tickles a slightly nervy putt to four feet. He’s left with a tricky downhill tiddler, but knocks it straight into the middle of the cup. Nerveless? Not quite: he’s breathing quite heavily as he walks off the green, trying to calm himself down. But he’s in pole position to claim his first major. Fowler threatens to run him close, though: he splashes smartly out of the bunker at 16, sending his ball over the flag and letting the slope do the work to bring it back to the hole. He taps in for par.Jordan Spieth screeches a wedge to ten feet. Sadly, his putt to equal the course-record of 63 stays high on the left. Bogey is such a disappointing end to his round, but that’s a spectacular final-day 64 which sets a clubhouse mark of -13. A huge ovation from the Augusta gallery as he wanders off to the marker’s hut. That was a Homeric effort. Will it be enough? Because back on 15, Reed lays up but sends a nervous wedge just over the back of the green. He’s only marginally off, mind, so will be putting from there. And on 16, Fowler finds the bunker front left.On 18, Cameron Smith is inches away for a birdie that would have brought him back in 29. He taps in for a par, and a 66. He ends the week at -9. Back down the hole, Spieth pearls a fairway wood up towards the green, but he’ll be left with a chip from 50 yards, and he needs to get up and down to equal the course record and set a clubhouse mark at -14. Meanwhile Fowler is on the 15th in two. He’s got a long eagle putt, and gives the 60-footer a trundle. It races six feet past. But he knocks in the return for birdie, and he’s two back at -13. Rahm can’t scramble his par, though, and drops to -11. His grim look suggests he knows his bid has fallen short.Spieth’s tee shot at 18 clips an overhanging branch down the left, and drops straight down. He’ll have a long, long second into the green. He’ll probably not reach the putting surface. He can still make four, but three looks a pipe dream. Meanwhile back on 15, Reed’s tee shot skirts down the left. It’s on the fairway, but he might not want to risk a hook round the trees to go for the green in two.Rahm might be spent, too, because his second into 15 hits the bank on the far side of the water, and topples back into the drink. This hole caused his compatriot Sergio so much pain earlier in the week ... now a second Spaniard looks to have succumbed to its watery grave. He could still scramble par, of course, but holes are running out.Spieth’s birdie effort on 17 slips by on the high, right side. He’ll remain at -14, and will need something up 18 you’d have thought. Because back on 14, Reed rolls in his birdie putt, and he’s once again the leader of this Tournament! McIlroy rolls his long one to three feet, but then misses the tiddler, which just about sums up his performance today. His putting has been appalling, and his race is run.Aside from the small matter of this year’s green jacket, Jordan Spieth just needs one more birdie to break the course record. He sets himself up by knocking his second at 17 to 20 feet. Meanwhile back on 14, Reed caresses his approach to eight feet. That is wonderful, given he’s under serious attack from Spieth. McIlroy finds the green in regulation, but it’s a fair way from the flag. He’s the only player in the top 25 over par for his round.Patrick Reed: the Tom Weiskopf de nos jours? Nicklaus’s birdie at 16 in 1975 shook Weiskopf now Reed chips ten feet short from the bank on 13 and can’t knock in the birdie putt. Par, which means he’s still only tied for the lead. McIlroy makes birdie but at -10 it’s surely too late for him. Rahm birdies 14, and now he’s just two behind at -12. Meanwhile birdie for Smith at 17, his sixth in the last eight holes since the turn! He’s -9.Spieth’s 8-iron into 16 is well short of the flag. He’s left with a 33-foot putt for his birdie. And in it goes! A right-to-left slider and perfectly paced! It’s not totally dissimilar to the putt that effectively won the 1975 Masters for Jack Nicklaus! That is absurd! He doesn’t cavort like Jack did, but does look at his caddy as if to say: did that really happen?! You’ll be seeing that one again! He’s now the joint leader of the 2018 Tournament!Rory sends his drive at 13 into the second cut down the right. He does very well to lash a long iron into the heart of the green. He desperately needs eagle now. He’s got a 35-foot chance. Then a huge stroke of fortune for Reed! He hits a heavy second towards Rae’s Creek! But the ball sticks on the bank on the far side, and he stays dry! For a second that looked like a real game-changer ... actually, speaking of which ...Birdie for Rahm at the par-five 13th. That was fairly easy and basic, having found the green in two ... though Fowler matches his effort in more roundabout style, shooting his second into the swale to the back left of the green, then bundling a wonder chip across a treacherous slope to eight feet, and knocking in the putt. Meanwhile Cameron Smith makes it four birdies in a row at 15 ... then nearly cards a fifth in sensational style. His tee shot is poor, and flirts with the water, but sticks in the bank. Then he hits a gorgeous and intelligent wedge, over the flag, using the bank to bring the ball back towards the hole. It looks like trickling in, but stays an inch out on the right, and it’s just par. But he’s -8 now. “COME ON!!!!” McIlroy’s putt at 12 sails harmlessly past the cup. Another par when he really needs birdies. And then Reed rolls his unerringly into the cup! No messing! This brilliant 27-year-old Texan keeps bouncing back, every time he slips up! Hence the big COME ON. A birdie which ensures he stays in the lead ... because up on 15, Spieth makes his birdie putt. Spieth stays on Reed’s tail, though.Reed finds the back of the green at 12. So does Rory. Neither tee shot is all that, but at least they’ll both be putting. The quality of golf in this final pairing is pretty poor: of all the challengers, they’re the only ones not under par. They’re the only ones over par. Meanwhile Spieth finds the 15th green in two. He’s left with a 60-footer across the green ... and leaves it a good eight feet short. Will he pass up the chance to make birdie?Reed bumps a wonderful wedge to seven feet. McIlroy clanks a clumsy one a similar distance past. Reed’s par putt lips out he drops back towards the chasing pack. Rory really needs to make his ... but he pulls it to the left. His putter is stone cold. His bid is as good as over, surely, because he just isn’t making a single thing on the greens. Meanwhile Rahm’s 20-foot slider along 12 dies to the left par. Fowler makes no mistake from 10 feet, though, and having been quiet in the early stages today, his bid is alive and very real! And on 15, Dustin lets an eagle putt from 12 feet slip by on the right. What a chance to really close in on the leaders. But that’s birdie, and he’s still in this! And look at this leaderboard!Reed isn’t quite in the trees, but he can’t go for the green. He punches down the hill, and will hope to get up and down from 50 yards. McIlroy can’t take advantage, though, pushing his second down the swale to the right of the green. That is very poor. Over on 12, Fowler and Rahm find the green and will be looking at birdie putts again. And Cameron Smith has put a good run together: the 24-year-old Aussie prospect has birdied 10, 12, 13 and now 14, and he’s -7, looking at a high finish and another visit next year.Rahm’s effort from 40 feet stops just shy of the cup. Par. Fowler is having a look from half that distance. It slides by on the high side to the right. Par. On 13, Bubba lashes his second into the green and strokes in the eagle putt: he’s -8. Up on 14, Spieth finds the centre of the green in two, but can’t steer in his birdie effort from 20 feet. And Tony Finau’s run of birdies comes to an end, by the width of a ball on 18. Par, and he’s back in 31, signing for a 66. What a brilliant performance after nearly suffering serious injury on Wednesday as he celebrated that hole-in-one during the par-three contest. He ends the week at -7, and has a good chance of a very high finish and a place in next year’s Tournament.Reed hoicks a wild drive into the trees down the right of 11. A chance for McIlroy to start fighting back? He blooters a drive down the middle of the fairway, anyway. Much will depend on what’s happened to Reed’s ball. Down on the green, Rahm and Fowler both find the dancefloor in regulation, and will have looks at birdie.Tony Finau, who very nearly didn’t make it this week after dislocating his ankle during the par-three contest, has just carded six birdies in a row between 12 and 17. Now there’s a run he could sell to anyone in the leading pack for a cash sum. He’s -7, just off the pace. Back on 10, Reed and McIlroy make pars. McIlroy will be happier, since he’d left himself a long two-putt, the result of finding the second cut with his drive, while Reed didn’t quite make a 20-foot uphill birdie chance, one turn shy of pace. But the bigger picture will please Reed: he’s now just eight holes from home, with a four-shot advantage over his partner. He’ll be worried more about Spieth right now. Can McIlroy respond with some magic? He’ll need to do something soon if he’s to give Reed something to think about.Jordan Spieth drives into the pine needles down the right of 13 ... then creams a fairway wood onto the green, straight at the flag, that compares with Phil Mickelson’s famous clatter from a similar position in 2010! That’s a real seize-the-day moment! What a stunning shot! He’s arrowed that to 12 feet from 230 yards! What an eagle chance he’s set himself up. Will he get the reward for such bravery and brilliance? No. He sets it off to the left, and it’s never turning back. He rises to -12, mind. For the record, Mickelson never made eagle after that shot, either. Another birdie for Dustin Johnson, by the way, now at 14. So he’s keeping himself on the fringe of the action.They’ve just shown a montage of Rory’s travails with the putter on the front nine. To recap: he’s missed very makeable putts at 2, 3, 5, 8 and 9. And he trails Reed by four. It doesn’t take a genius. Meanwhile another birdie for Dustin Johnson, this time at 13: he rises to -7, which is three behind the leading pack. Reed lands his third 15 feet past the flag, a clever shot as it allows the slope of the green to take his ball back to tap-in distance. What a par save! And he’s further boosted when McIlroy leaves his short birdie putt high on the right. The flat stick is costing McIlroy. You can’t keep putting like this and expect to win the Masters. A shame, because he was rolling them in from everywhere yesterday. But he’s lost his mojo, and perhaps more importantly, his confidence. His race isn’t yet run, but he needs to buck himself up quickly, because he’s letting too many chances slip by, and Reed doesn’t look in the mood to do anything stupid.The astonishing Jordan Spieth is now Patrick Reed’s closest rival! He trundles in a gentle-left-to-right slider from the apron at the back of 12, and the hole that’s caused him so much pain pays him something back! He’s -11, three off Reed’s lead ... and Reed’s just left his second short at 9 ... and watched in horror as his ball rolls off the front of the green and back down the fairway! Meanwhile McIlroy lands his second well behind the flag, then spins it back pin high, leaving a 12-footer across the green for birdie! What’s that they say about the Masters only starting around the turn on Sunday, again?!Hole-in-one at 16 for Charley Hoffman! He skelps his tee shot straight at the flag. Well, a little to the left. It takes one bounce off the tilt of the green caused by the back of the bunker, and rolls unerringly into the cup! Hoffman cavorts with a huge grin on his face, as the crowd go loco! That’s the 12th hole-in-one at 16 on Sunday in the last 16 years! And one of the simplest. The ball lands with a bang, takes one jump to the right, and rolls in! He’s -6 after a great run today: birdies at 2, 3, 7 and 15, bogey at 11, and now this!Spieth sends his tee shot at 12 into the light stuff at the back of 12. But he’s over the drink this year without his ball disappearing into the blue vagueness, and he holds his arms aloft in victory, earning a cheer from the gallery for his good humour. That’s a lovely moment. Meanwhile back on 9, Fowler wedges his second over the flag. The ball spins back to four feet, and that’s back-to-back birdies for the popular Californian. He’s -10.Reed sends his third into 8 to ten feet. A great uphill chance for birdie. But he pushes it. Just the par, but never mind: McIlroy can only send his third, a long iron, to the swale to the right of the green. He trundles a hot chip six feet past, and can’t stroke in the one coming back. All of a sudden, Reed’s lead is four, and McIlroy is back in the pack! He doesn’t look happy right now at all. He’s never been quite on it today, from the get-go. That eagle yip on 2 won’t have helped, mind.Spieth doesn’t hit his fairly straightforward putt (by the standards of Augusta) for once. His ball stops a couple of feet short of the cup, and that’s just a par. Meanwhile Stenson drops a shot at 9, which means he’s out in level-par 36. At -7, his race is run. Birdie for his partner Fleetwood, his first of the day, but after bogeys at 2 and 7, he’s -5 and well out of contention. Spieth knows this Masters could be his, if he continues like this and posts a score. The best comebacks in Masters history were made by Jack Burke Jr., in 1956 and Gary Player in 1978 both were eight back going into the final round. Spieth trailed by nine at the start of the day. So he launches an arrow straight at the flag on 11 from the top of the hill. Not a concern for the water to the left. It’s a beauty, and he’ll have an uphill putt from 25 feet for another birdie!A sad end to Paul Casey’s round: a three-putt par on 18. That’s a bogey-bogey finish, and he’ll have to make do with a 65. Make do with a 65 at Augusta! Anyway, he’s risen up the leaderboard to -5, having carded 69-65 at the weekend. Shame about the 74-75 start. Back on 8, Fowler makes birdie after wedging to a couple of feet Rahm saves his par. They’re -9 and -10 respectively. And further down the hole, McIlroy is forced to chip out from the pines, while Reed lashes up the fairway from the bunker.Reed finds a fairway bunker down the right of 8 with his drive. McIlroy wangs a wild one into the trees down the same side. Up the hole, Rahm is in bother, having hooked his second into trees on the left. His punch out isn’t all that, but he chips close with his fourth and scrambles a par. Spieth pars 10, though he’s only inches away from curling in a huge right-to-left breaker up the green for a birdie on the hardest hole on the course. At -10 he’s four behind Reed, though, as the big man taps in to convert his birdie. What can Rory do by way of response? Well, his chip takes a huge bounce to the left, off the shoulder of a bunker, but he rolls in the four footer that remains. That’s a good par from where his drive ended up, but he won’t be feeling that great as a result of Reed’s brilliant second."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0d3a6af2a91e1bf7a0f7b335c6691ef71c2fbc3/0_166_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=52971ea080bd8e1d229e6cf61eb986fe 1240w","title":"jesus female disciples the new evidence a timely new take on the ultimate boys club","story":"Was Mary Magdalene in fact an important dignitary from a town on the Sea of Galilee? Just one of the surprising theories from this look at the most misogynistic story ever toldUntil now, the women in the Bible have been split broadly into “pious onlookers or repentant prostitutes”. But in Jesus’ Female Disciples: The New Evidence, Bible experts Helen Bond and Joan Taylor are determined to prove that the women in the greatest story ever told have been gradually side-lined and all but\u0026nbsperased.Naturally, to do this they must go on a\u0026nbspjourney. I\u0026nbsphave long since given up hope that another means of historical TV investigation might be deployed.

Did Joanna flee the court of Herod and add her own wealth to the pot so that the men could gad about healing the lame and spreading the\u0026nbspword?Moving on to Israel, our experts laugh about hot flushes in the noonday heat as they question why Magdalene is always portrayed as a\u0026nbsplouche nympho with the hots for God’s son when there is no evidence for this in the\u0026nbspBible.The theories they come up with may be hard to prove, but they save the best until last. A\u0026nbspvisit to Naples takes them under the city to a\u0026nbspseries of wall paintings uncovered in 2009 in which a\u0026nbspwoman is depicted holding the gospels in flame. This could only indicate she was a\u0026nbspbishop, according to a\u0026nbsplocal expert.

Hours of film and voice recordings, much of it mould-damaged, believed to cover most of the eight-day procedure were found stashed in metal and wooden boxes – along with millions of classified Czechoslovak Communist party documents – in the basement of a bankrupt former metal research business in Panenské Břežany, near Prague.The discovery came after Czech historians and archivists lost trace of recordings known to have been made on the orders of the communist authorities in preparation for a propaganda film that was never produced.The material was found by an insolvency specialist, who alerted historians after seeing labels on the boxes that clearly advertised their content.By strange coincidence, the bankrupt plant occupied the same grounds as a castle which, during the occupation of Czechoslovakia, was used as a residence by the Nazi governor of Bohemia and Moravia, Reinhard Heydrich, an architect of the Holocaust, until his assassination in 1942.The items are believed to have been removed from the Communist party’s headquarters and hidden after the 1989 Velvet Revolution that ended its 41-year rule in what was then Czechoslovakia.Historians are unsure whether they were spirited away to ensure their safekeeping with a view to selling them for profit or to conceal evidence about the trial, which is widely considered one of the darkest stains on the party’s record.The material – consisting of six hours of 35mm black-and-white film and 80 hours of audio – is now with the Czech National Film Archive, which is asking the government for an estimated 12m koruna (£410,000) to fund delicate restoration work that would make it fit for public viewing.Michal Bragant, the archive’s chief executive, called the discovery “a great opportunity” because it would allow Czech archivists to compile a rare video depiction of Stalin-era show trials, very few of which have available long-form footage.“The priority is to make the footage safe,” Bragant said. “But it will be even safer once it’s publicly available, because we also need to make the knowledge safe. We still have not learned enough from the 20th century. The more people learn about it and the horror of the show trials, the safer we will be.“One day, when we can make it available for the public, you will be able to see the facial expressions, people’s movements, the body language and the staged performances. Because this was nothing to do with due process. It was all rehearsed.”Slánský, who spent much of the second world war exiled in Moscow, was put on trial along with 13 other high-ranking communists in November 1952, accused of “Titoism” and Zionism. The charges were fuelled by Stalin’s wish to purge eastern European communist parties after the Soviet Union’s break with the Yugoslav regime of Josip Broz Tito and his anger that Israel, born four years earlier, had not become a communist state.The trial had antisemitic overtones, with Slánský and 10 of the other defendants being Jewish. Slánský is believed to have been tortured into a convoluted, rehearsed confession, which he made in court before requesting to be punished with the death penalty.He was hanged in Prague’s Pankrac prison on 3 December 1952, but was exonerated during the liberalising Prague spring of 1968. Plans to turn the trial footage into a propaganda film were shelved after Stalin died in March 1953."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3877b301d26412260c25aab4703d54780ad17d61/0_82_2220_1332/master/2220.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c04e73d803f050a3c938166e54ca1a2d 1240w","title":"hungary election victor orban expected to win third term live updates","story":"Follow the latest developments as prime minister’s Fidesz party heads for victory after anti-immigration campaignGergely Karácsony, the defeated Socialist candidate for prime minister, is giving his reaction to his party’s deep defeat.The result is not what we hoped for, but nevertheless as the losers we must always congratulate the winners.

It sounds like a win-win situation, but is a Lifetime Isa right for you?If someone offered you thousands of pounds towards the purchase of your first home, you might think the prospect was too good to be true. But that’s what’s on offer if you save using a Lifetime Isa. The latest addition to the range of inidual savings accounts, Lifetime Isas give savers the chance to earn extra funds to put towards their first property or later life.“Having the government bonus is a great way to boost your savings – for every £4 you save you are getting another £1,” says Nici Audhlam-Gardiner, managing director at financial services provider OneFamily. “Even if you have got a relatively small amount to save, it does add up.”There are, of course, a couple of catches – the money can only be used to buy a property if it is genuinely your first, and the accounts can only be opened by people aged 18 to 39. However, the bonus keeps being paid, every month you pay in, until you turn 50. That means if you start as soon as you turn 18 and put in the maximum every year, you can get up to £32,000 from the government.“It isn’t for short-term savings – when people open one, either they are going to use it for a house deposit or it is going to be tucked away for their retirement,” says Audhlam-Gardiner.If you’re a steady Eddie and don’t fancy taking too much risk, a cash Lifetime Isa, similar to a normal savings account, may be most appealing.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Department of Foreign Affairs has collected emergency plans from all Government departments amounting to 280 documents in preparation for the possibility of no deal being reached on Brexit. Plans were sought by the department, which is leading the Government’s preparations for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019, as part of contingency planning for a worst-case scenario. The reports sought from the departments are aimed at preparing a Government-wide response to manage a disorderly Brexit, including any emergency legislation required and measures to deal with high tariffs imposed on goods entering and leaving the UK and delays at Irish and British ports. In some cases, the department has sought more detailed plans, resulting in dozens more documents being submitted by the Departments of Finance and Business. The Department of Finance has looked at whether new legislation would be required for financial services in the event of a hard Brexit given that contracts in this area are governed by English law.The potential number of new customs and excise staff and additional resources required by the Revenue Commissioners to manage post-Brexit inspections and Border checks has also been explored by the department.“A massive amount of work has been going on across all Government departments to ensure Ireland is prepared for every eventuality with Brexit,” said a spokesman for Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney, who is managing the Government’s Brexit team.“We have to be prepared for a disorderly Brexit and that work is under way, it is contingency planning we hope never to have to use,” he added.The department has declined to release details of the planning contained within the documents as it was “still being processed and is extremely sensitive” with Brexit negotiations ongoing, said the spokesman.“It is not in the national interest for us to air our contingency planning for all to see during international negotiations which are of such fundamental importance for the future of the island,” he said.EU and UK negotiators have been meeting over the quiet Easter period in Brussels discussing for the first time potential ways to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland.In a separate development, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has accepted an invitation to visit Ireland again at the end of this month. Mr Barnier is expected to visit the Border and possibly Belfast when he visits for the Government’s next all-island civic dialogue on Brexit, comprising 1,500 civic society and industry representatives, in Dundalk, Co Louth. Ahead of that visit, Mr Coveney will continue his round of shuttle Brexit diplomacy, briefing foreign ministers of smaller EU countries over the coming week on Ireland’s concerns around the UK’s departure.Portuguese foreign minister Augusto Santos Silva will visit Mr Coveney at Iveagh House in Dublin on Monday. The Tánaiste will meet the new Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, in The Hague on Wednesday.He will then host German foreign minister Heiko Maas in Dublin on Thursday.

We want to wear these clothes’, and we would probably allow that.”Mr Maloney told The Sunday Times that last year during inclusivity week, one boy had decided to wear a long skirt for a few days to make a point.It comes as television doctor Christian Jessen, who spent three years at Uppingham, said he would “probably” have worn a skirt for its shock value had he been permitted to do so.Dr Jessen said neutral uniforms would help move away from gender stereotypes, but warned against early medical intervention in the case of children who were experimenting with gender in adolescence.Uppingham School in Rutland\u0026#39s alumni includes Stephen Fry and celebrity chef Rick SteinThe £36,000-a-year public school admitted its first female student as a day-girl in 1973 and is now fully co-educational.Unlike a growing number of public and state schools which have introduced “gender neutral” uniforms Uppingham still has separate uniforms for its male and female pupils.Boys wear charcoal trousers, white shirts and black jumpers. Girls wear grey skirts, white shirts, and cerise jumpers.  Both wear black blazers.Gareth Doodes, headteacher of Devon College, welcomed the news but warned the school ethos was more important.“I think it’s about more than one statement, it’s the entire culture,\u0026quot he said.“It’s about ensuring that a school is pastorally calibrated to ensure a child feels confident to wear the uniform of another sex.”Teenage boys at a school in Exeter, Devon, wear skirts in protest at strict uniform codesMr Doodes said Dover, which has 300 pupils between three and 18 years old, had no plans to introduce gender neutral uniforms but had worked to create an environment in which clothing choice was not seen as exclusive or isive.He added: “I don’t think it’s about gender neutrality, but rather, allowing pupils to express themselves fully in an environment with is safe and supportive.”One pupil at Dover has been permitted, with the consent of the pupil’s parents, to wear the uniform of the opposite sex.Last year alumni of the £20,000-a-year Highgate school in North London reacted with outrage when the school drew up a mix-and-match uniform policy allowing boys to wear skirts.One letter to the headteacher objected to “this preposterous proposal.”The school allows children to request staff address them by a name of the opposite gender, which around half a dozen have done. One boy has also been allowed to wear a dress to school.Other private schools have policies to deal with children questioning their gender identity.St Paul\u0027s Girls\u0027 School allows female pupils to be called by boys\u0027 names and wear boys\u0027 clothes.And Brighton College also replaced its uniform, which had been in place for 170 years, for a gender-neutral one.In 2016 around 80 state schools were allowing pupils to wear clothes of the opposite gender.Last year retailer John Lewis said it was removing girls and boys labels in its clothing as part of the fight against gender stereotyping.Hungary election: Viktor Orbán declares victory for third consecutive termBen Wallace attacks \u0026#39shameful\u0026#39 British values warning to Scottish teachersOrdeal by Innocence, episode two review – Agatha Christie’s legacy is safe with this masterful BBC adaptationWhite House fears other Russia defectors in Sergei Skripal spy swap could be attackedWhite House: British football fans should \u0026#39think twice\u0026#39 before going to Russia World CupWhite House warns Putin that no response is \u0026#39off the table\u0026#39 over Syrian gas atrocity, as pressure mounts on MayComment: The nation\u0026#39s politics have become nauseatingly pious since Iraq.

enough to secure a majority in Hungary’s 199-seat national assembly.Mr Orban and his wife voted early in the morning at a school in the Zugliget suburb of Budapest. \u0026quotThis is a country which has always stepped up for itself, so we can trust in the people, I will accept their decision,\u0026quot he said.Meanwhile Gabor Vona, the leader of the nationalist Jobbik party, cast his ballot in the northeastern town of Gyongyos, urging voters to turn out, saying that the result would \u0026quotdetermine the fate of Hungary not just for four years but... for two generations\u0026quot.Voters wait in line outside of a polling station during presidential elections in Budapest Mr Orban has been accused of increasingly monopolising Hungary’s media, with Fidesz-friendly oligarchs buying up large numbers of local newspaper and radio stations since 2010, sending Hungary sliding down international media transparency rankings.The government influence on the media was palpable in Sunday\u0027s broadcast by state television M1 news channel, where reports highlighting the negative effects of migration dominated the programming.On Origo.hu, a formerly independent website now owned by government allies, focused on migration with headlines like \u0026quotMigrant gangs fought in England,\u0026quot \u0026quotThey can\u0027t stand it anymore in Sweden: They\u0027ve had enough of migrants,\u0026quot and \u0026quotA migrant in underpants beat a German retiree half to death.\u0026quotThe use of Hungary’s diplomatic corps to collect such “negative” stories, as revealed in an email leaked to The Telegraph on Saturday, led to a chorus of complaints. Hungarian government spokesmen continued to refuse to comment.Niclas Trouvé, Sweden’s Ambassador to Hungary, said the leaked email must be “thoroughly looked into”, while Marton Gyongyosi, a Jobbik MP, said the the request for such stories was reminiscent of 1950s Communist era.Ferenc Gyurcsány, a former Hungarian prime minister and leader of the Democratic Coalition condemned the use of Hungary’s embassies for “propaganda” purposes when asked about the email at a press conference.The EU’s election monitoring group, the OSCE, will make a preliminary statement on the conduct of the election on Monday.Please review our commenting policyHungary election: Viktor Orbán declares victory for third consecutive termBen Wallace attacks \u0026#39shameful\u0026#39 British values warning to Scottish teachersOrdeal by Innocence, episode two review – Agatha Christie’s legacy is safe with this masterful BBC adaptationWhite House fears other Russia defectors in Sergei Skripal spy swap could be attackedWhite House: British football fans should \u0026#39think twice\u0026#39 before going to Russia World CupWhite House warns Putin that no response is \u0026#39off the table\u0026#39 over Syrian gas atrocity, as pressure mounts on MayComment: The nation\u0026#39s politics have become nauseatingly pious since Iraq.

Let the people decide”.Another called the move: “Pointless expensive propaganda”.Speaking at the protest the Plaid Cymru councillor Keith Parry said the decision to rename the bridge should not have been made unilaterally.The Second Severn Crossing, which is set to be renamed after Prince Charles to mark his 70th birthday year“If the bridge is going to be named there needs to be a consultation,” he said.Neil McEvoy, a member of the Welsh Assembly, also called for the Welsh public to have a say.“There has been a complete lack of consultation with the people of Wales. It is outrageous the gateway to the country has been renamed and no one knows anything about it,” he said.“People are angry because it signifies how Wales is taken for granted and that has to stop. I have written to the minister asking for him to reconsider because the name change should not go ahead.”In a statement released on April 5 Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: “I’m delighted to announce that - with the agreement of the Prime Minister and Her Majesty The Queen - the Second Severn Crossing will be renamed the Prince of Wales Bridge.Prince Charles, pictured in the Daintree Rainforest, is currently on tour in Australia“The announcement is a fitting tribute to His Royal Highness in a year that sees him mark 60 years as The Prince of Wales and decades of continued, dedicated service to our nation.“Renaming one of the most iconic landmarks in Wales is a fitting way to formally recognise his commitment and dedication to Wales and the UK as the Prince of Wales.”Mr Cairns has rebuffed criticism of the decision saying the \u0026quotsilent majority\u0026quot would support renaming the bridge.The Welsh Government has confirmed that Mr Cairns wrote to First Minister Carwyn Jones last year and no objections were raised.Hungary election: Viktor Orbán declares victory for third consecutive termBen Wallace attacks \u0026#39shameful\u0026#39 British values warning to Scottish teachersWhite House fears other Russia defectors in Sergei Skripal spy swap could be attackedWhite House: British football fans should \u0026#39think twice\u0026#39 before going to Russia World CupOrdeal by Innocence, episode two review – Agatha Christie’s legacy is safe with this masterful BBC adaptationWhite House warns Putin that no response is \u0026#39off the table\u0026#39 over Syrian gas atrocity, as pressure mounts on MayComment: The nation\u0026#39s politics have become nauseatingly pious since Iraq.

Russia\u0026#39s World Cup begins in June 2018British football fans should “think twice” before traveling to the Russian World Cup because they will be more exposed after recent diplomatic expulsions, the White House has warned. Senior US administration officials said Britain and America’s embassies in Russia will be less able to help fans after staff were ordered home after the Salisbury poisoning. Fans who get ill and need to be urgently sent home will find they are less likely to get consular support, one official warned. They also said that anti-terrorism co-operation between America and Russia over the World Cup has been dented by the recent diplomatic row.The stark warning comes just two months before the World Cup begins. Some 10,000 England fans are expected to attend. Tensions between the West and Russia have spiked after Sergei Skripal, the Russian double agent, and his daughter Yulia were poisoned last month. Russia has expelled 23 UK and 60 US diplomats, including many who worked in the embassies. The move matched the expulsions of Russian diplomats from those countries. A senior US administration official, who asked not to be named, suggested UK and US fans travelling to the World Cup should “think twice” about going given the diminished consular support. “We won’t have the same ability to protect our citizens or even just deal with the regular consular affairs,” the official said. Asked to explain the concerns, the official added: “If you get into any kind of difficulty there then we just won’t have the wherewithal. People have accidents. They get ill, they need to be meacked out.“We’re not suggesting that there are going to be some major sets of incidents but it’s just that there are those larger concerns.“We were trying to work with the Russians on counter-terrorism as well. Any large sporting event no matter what country now is a target. “And so we’ve now got less ability to be able to do with the Russians than before because they’ve decimated the counterparts who would be dealing with this kind of thing, for the UK and the US. The official added: “For the UK, I think that is a big challenge. The UK is a great sporting nation, it takes its soccer seriously. UK soccer fans show up everywhere. “Is your embassy going to be able to provide for them or are they going to have to then outsource some of the regular consular support to others?”English fans having purchased a total of 28,000 tickets for all World Cup matches – well down on the number bought at this stage for the Brazil 2014 World Cup. Concerns over violence between English and Russian fans amid the countries\u0027 heightened tensions have been expressed by a number of UK political figures. There were ugly clashes between both sets of fans when the countries faced each other at the Euro 2016 competition in France. Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, has said he could not think of “anything more counterproductive” to helping English fans visiting Russia for the world cup than the recent embassy expulsions. Hungary election: Viktor Orbán declares victory for third consecutive termBen Wallace attacks \u0026#39shameful\u0026#39 British values warning to Scottish teachersOrdeal by Innocence, episode two review – Agatha Christie’s legacy is safe with this masterful BBC adaptationWhite House fears other Russia defectors in Sergei Skripal spy swap could be attackedWhite House warns Putin that no response is \u0026#39off the table\u0026#39 over Syrian gas atrocity, as pressure mounts on MayComment: The nation\u0026#39s politics have become nauseatingly pious since Iraq.
