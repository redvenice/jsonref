He told Sky News there was \u0027light at the end of the tunnel\u0027 for the UK in its fight with Covid. He said: \u0027Looking at it from a UK point of view, there does appear to be light at the end of the tunnel… I think that it\u0027s going to be bumpy before we get to the end.\u0027So even though it\u0027s possible to start imagining that the end of the pandemic is not far away, just everybody be ready for the possibility that there will be more variations and mutations coming along, or that there will be further challenges, other surges of even Omicron coming.\u0027He said children do not get very ill from Covid, and \u0027we\u0027re going to have children acting as vectors of the virus for some time to come\u0027.He said there was a need to still be \u0027respectful of this virus\u0027, adding: \u0027Do what you can to stop transmitting it. Do what you can to protect others from being affected by it.

The health minister, Thanos Plevris, said fines would be collected through the tax office with the money to be used to help fund state hospitals. “The age factor is important because of its impact on the public health service,” Plevris told private Open TV on Sunday. A vaccination mandate was imposed for health care workers last year. And starting on 1 February, vaccination certificates for adults will expire after seven months unless the holder receives a booster shot. New infections sharply surged in early January, and have eased over the past week. Greece has the seventh oldest population in the world, as measured by share of residents aged 65 and over, according to the US-based Population Reference Bureau.Like China, Hong Kong maintains a strict zero-Covid strategy that has kept cases low, but has largely cut the finance hub off from both the mainland and the rest of the world for the last two years. A recent Omicron outbreak traced to Cathay air crew who breached their quarantine period led to a dramatic tightening of already strict anti-coronavirus controls - including shuttering kindergartens, primary schools, and indoor dining at night. Police announced late on Monday two flight attendants were arrested and charged for violating anti-Covid measures. “They had conducted unnecessary activities” on 25 and 27 December, when they were supposed to be under home quarantine after returning to Hong Kong, the statement said. “They were both subsequently tested positive for Covid-19 Omicron variant, and have been discharged from hospital upon completion of treatment,” it added. The two - who were fired after the quarantine breach - face up to six months in prison and a $640 fine. They have been released on bail and their cases will be heard next month. The revelation of the quarantine breach piles new pressure on the city’s flagship airline, already battered by the pandemic as border restrictions brought travel to a trickle into a city that used to be a transport and logistics hub. Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam said last week that authorities were investigating whether Cathay Pacific has complied with regulations, and could face legal action. In the onslaught of criticism, chairman Patrick Healy defended his airline, arguing that a “tiny minority” of rule-breakers should not overshadow Cathay Pacific’s contributions to Hong Kong. In 2021, the airline’s crew spent over 62,000 nights in quarantine hotels, he said, adding that 1,000 of their staff were subjected to more than 11,000 nights in Penny’s Bay, the city’s government quarantine camp. Unlike other carriers, Cathay Pacific has no domestic market to fall back on and a recent tightening of quarantine rules for aircrews has pushed it to scale back cargo flights - the one part of the business that was making money.Downing Street has said Boris and Carrie Johnson followed Covid guidance when the prime minister was “commuting” from Chequers to No 10 during the first lockdown in 2020 – but declined to answer further questions, including whether the pair held social events. It emerged last week that the prime minister and his then-fiancee travelled between No 10 and the spacious Buckinghamshire mansion between 16 and 27 March 2020, around the start of the first lockdown. On 16 March, the government advised the public to avoid all non-essential travel, and on 22 March, three days before a full lockdown was ordered, specified that essential travel “does not include visits to second homes”. However, the Tortoise website (paywall) reported that Johnson and his partner relocated to Chequers during this period, after which the prime minister continued to travel to Downing Street from Chequers to work for several days. Johnson’s official spokesperson insisted on Monday that they had not broken the rules, saying they “acted in accordance with both the guidance and subsequent legislation at all times”. “At the time as you know, Mrs Johnson was heavily pregnant, in a vulnerable category, and advised to minimise social contacts. So in line with clinical guidance and to minimise the risk to her, they were based at Chequers during that period, with the prime minister commuting to Downing Street to work,” he said. He said their decision to move was because of the specific nature of No 10, which “unusually, is both a private residence and an office for hundreds of people.” The spokesperson pointed out that by the time the guidance against travelling to second homes came in on 22 March, “the prime minister and his wife were already based in Chequers, acting in line with clinical guidance”. He declined to answer further questions, however, including whether parties or social events were held at Chequers while the pair were there. It has been reported that Carrie Johnson hosted a baby shower for a group of friends on 14 March 2020. By that time a minister, Nadine Dorries, had been diagnosed with Covid. Johnson isolated alone in his Downing Street flat after testing positive for Covid on 27 March, eventually being taken into St Thomas’ hospital and spending time in intensive care. He then returned to Chequers to convalesce. Johnson’s compliance with the strict restrictions in place in the first lockdown has come under intense scrutiny in recent days, since he apologised for attending a “bring your own booze” gathering, telling MPs he believed it was a “work event”. Johnson appears poised to blame a “culture” of drinking in No 10 for a series of rule-breaking parties, including two held on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral. But the prime minister’s critics say he played a key role in encouraging lockdown-busting behaviour. The story is here: No 10 defends PM’s trips between London and Chequers in March 2020 Novak Djokovic may not be allowed to defend his French Open title in May after the French government ruled that all athletes will have to be vaccinated in order to attend and compete in sporting events in France. Earlier in January, Maracineanu had suggested that athletes could be exempt from France’s vaccination requirements through a “bubble” system, but the government have now scrapped any such plans. Stanislas Guerini, the French MP and executive director for En Marche, said Djokovic’s behaviour was “irresponsible” as he discussed the Covid pass in an interview with RTL on Monday morning. “All the big events which will take place in France will also adopt the Covid pass,” he said. “Who would understand if we asked our citizens to make an effort and respect the rules if we authorise some to get out of them?” Djokovic arrived back in Belgrade, Serbia on Monday after being deported from Australia following the cancellation of his visa by the Australian immigration minister, Alex Hawke. Under Australia’s visa cancellation rules, Djokovic is currently banned from re-applying for a visa for three years. Read the full story here: Djokovic’s French Open title defence in doubt after Covid pass ruling Israel’s Sheba Medical Center has given second booster shots in a trial among its staff and is studying the effect of the Pfizer booster in 154 people after two weeks and the Moderna booster in 120 people after one week, said Gili Regev-Yochay, head of the Infectious Diseases Unit. These were compared to a control group that did not receive the fourth shot. Those in the Moderna group had previously received three shots of Pfizer’s vaccine, the hospital said. The vaccines led to a increase in the number of antibodies “even a little bit higher than what we had after the third dose”, said Regev-Yochay. “Yet, this is probably not enough for the Omicron,” she told reporters. “We know by now that the level of antibodies needed to protect and not to got infected from Omicron is probably too high for the vaccine, even if it’s a good vaccine.” The findings, which the hospital said were the first of its kind in the world, were preliminary and not yet published. Israel was the fastest country to roll out initial vaccinations against Covid a year ago and last month started offering a fourth shot, or a second booster, to the most vulnerable and high-risk groups.That compares to 75,031 infections and 91 fatalities recorded in the 24 hours prior.Writing in the journal Nature Genetics, experts report how they studied data from 69,841 iniduals aged 18 or over who are taking part in a study with the genetics company 23andMe, and reported having had a Covid positive test.   “These findings provide a genetic link to the biological mechanisms underlying Covid-19-related loss of smell or taste,” the authors write. However it seems other factors are also at play, including the variant involved. According to a recent report from the UK Health Security Agency: “Of symptomatic cases, loss of smell and taste was found to be more common in people who tested positive for Delta than those who had Omicron.”Milley’s most recent contact with president Joe Biden was on 12 January at the funeral of retired General Raymond Odierno, the spokesman said on Monday.  Milley had tested negative several days prior to and each day following contact with Biden, until yesterday, the spokesman added. All other Joint Chiefs of Staff except for one tested negative for Covid-19 yesterday, the spokesman said, without saying who else had tested positive.  Milley is vaccinated and has received his booster, the spokesman added. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this month. He tested negative on 9 January and exited isolation to return to work at the Pentagon.Until last week, the isolation period was 10 days. The latest decision, which takes effect on Wednesday, brings Israel in line with recommendations in countries including the United States and England. A negative home antigen test is also required before ending isolation, the ministry said. The country’s pandemic-response coordinator, Salman Zarka, said the health ministry has found that people are at their most contagious during the first three days after infection. One in four doctors in the NHS are so tired that their ability to treat patients has become impaired, according to the first survey to reveal the impact of sleep deprivation on medics during the coronavirus pandemic. Growing workloads, longer hours and widespread staff shortages are causing extreme tiredness among medics, leading to memory problems and difficulty concentrating, according to the report by the Medical Defence Union (MDU), which provides legal support to about 200,000 doctors, nurses, dentists and other healthcare workers. The survey of more than 500 doctors across the UK, carried out within the past month and seen by the , uncovered almost 40 near misses as a direct result of exhaustion. In at least seven cases, patients actually sustained harm. Despite encouraging signs the Omicron wave may be fading, doctors admitted the constant pressure of the past 22 months spent fighting coronavirus on the frontline was taking a toll on their technical skills and even their ability to make what should be straightforward medical decisions. Medics admitted for the first time sleep deprivation was causing real harm to patients in the NHS. One described how their patient collapsed after being prescribed penicillin, something they had previously told the same doctor they were allergic to. The doctor blamed a “perfect storm” of “chronic fatigue” and “an unmanageable workload”. Another said widespread staff shortages meant “mistakes are more frequent by the end of the day”. “Doctors and their healthcare colleagues are running on empty,” said Dr Matthew Lee, the chief executive of the MDU. The full story is here: One in four NHS doctors tired to the point of impairment, survey finds “The vaccine is being finished … it should be in the clinic in coming weeks. We are hoping in the March timeframe to be able to have data to share with regulators to figure out next steps,” Bancel said at the World Economic Forum’s virtual Davos Agenda conference. The company is also developing a single vaccine that combines a booster dose against Covid-19 with its experimental flu shot.  Bancel said the best case scenario was the combined Covidflu vaccine would be available by the fall of 2023, at least in some countries. Many countries are already offering a third dose of a Covid jab to their citizens, especially to older iniduals and those who are immunocompromised, while Israel and Chile have started offering their citizens a fourth dose. Earlier in January, Moderna’s CEO said people may need a fourth shot in the autumn of 2022 as the efficacy of boosters against Covid was likely to decline over the next few months. However, booster programmes have met with skepticism from some disease experts over whether, and how widely, additional doses should become available, including the European Union’s drug regulator, which has expressed doubts about the need for a fourth booster dose. Speaking at the same event, top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said there was no evidence that repeat booster doses would overwhelm the immune system. Fauci said the goal should be to have a booster that induces a response against multiple potential variants.

A month and a half later, he tested positive for the virus again.The rapid spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant throughout the State has had an impact on not just daily case counts, but also the number of re-infections.In Byrne’s case, his first experience with the virus largely felt like a bad head cold. However, the second time “it was a much worse dose”.“I woke up with really bad pain, chills, I couldn’t get out of the bed. Bright lights gave me a migraine. Fatigue was setting in – I was finding it hard to stay awake when watching TV and there was a general feeling of tiredness in my muscles and my body,” he said.After several days, Byrne said the symptoms eased and returned to what he described as head cold-type symptoms.Byrne, who had the one-shot Janssen vaccine, said he was “really surprised” when he contracted Covid again, as it was only six weeks after his initial dose.“I thought I’d be okay for at least three months,” he added.Dr Gerald Barry, a virologist at UCD, said Covid reinfection has always been possible, but the likelihood of it has increased with the latest variant of concern.A study from Imperial College London found the risk of reinfection with Omicron was 5.4 times that of Delta.Case volumesIn Ireland, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) said it could not provide figures for the number of Covid reinfections in the State, as a result of the current Covid-19 case volumes.Barry said: “The idea that if you’ve had an infection previously that you’re immune or protected from a new infection, that’s just not the reality with this virus.”The body creates memories of previous infections, which then trigger a quick antibody response if exposed to the same virus again, he explained.However, as a virus mutates, the body becomes unable to recognise it as quickly as it previously would have, allowing the person to become infected.“If you’ve had an infection previously, you could be exposed to the same virus a lot, and if the antibodies are still high in your body within weeks or months post that initial infection, then, although you’ll be exposed to it, it’s very unlikely the virus will take hold,” he said.“But if you have a new variant that your body hasn’t seen before, then the virus has a much higher chance of taking hold, particularly in your upper respiratory tract, and you might see symptoms of infection.”Reinfection is not just a risk with the Omicron variant, either, according to Dr Barry, who said he had heard of people contracting Delta more than once.Dominant variantLinda Coogan Byrne contracted Covid-19 in January 2021 and again in the summer of that year, a time during which Alpha was the most dominant variant in circulation.“I was absolutely floored,” Coogan Byrne said. “My chest was really sore. My taste and smell went away and it took about six weeks to come back. And there was brain fog too.”However, the second time, the most severe symptom experienced was night sweats, a difference Coogan Byrne attributed to the previous infection, as well as having been fully vaccinated by that time.“You do build up a tolerance, I think. It wasn’t that bad at all the second time. Waiting it out was the biggest inconvenience.”Milder symptoms in subsequent infections is common, according to Dr Barry, particularly if the second infection is with the Omicron variant.This is both a result of the antibodies from the previous infection, and the early indications that Omicron causes less severe infection, he said.Considerably milderThat was the case for Helen Whelan, whose symptoms were considerably milder when she contracted the virus the second time in early January, despite not yet being vaccinated on either occasion.When Whelan first contracted it in September 2020, she had a headache, sore sinuses and a cold, spending the 10 days “pretty much in bed with no energy and sleeping all the time”.The second time has been much more manageable. “I’d describe it as a bad head cold more than anything but I haven’t missed a day of work.”Craig Dwyer, who contracted Covid-19 twice in just over seven weeks, had a similar experience.The first time he had it, in November, he had extreme fatigue, and the symptoms of a head cold and sinus infection. The second time, last week, it was only a scratchy throat.“I’m not feeling too bad at all this time,” he said. “I was hoping that because I had it already, I would have some sort of immunity, but I guess I didn’t.”Dwyer (32) had the one-shot Janssen vaccine, and now must wait three months before he is eligible for a booster for additional protection.“I’m probably a little bit more nervous now than I was after contracting it the first time, because I thought I had a bit of immunity then.“I don’t necessarily feel as safe or protected. I’m really hoping I can just go the three months so I can get a booster.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nursing homes say government must stay ahead of fourth covid 19 jab issue","story":"It is about three months since many nursing home residents received their third booster doses. Photograph: iStockThe nursing home sector has called on the Government to stay “ahead of” international guidance on fourth Covid-19 vaccine doses for older people as it awaits official advice on the jab.Tadhg Daly, chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland, said that fourth doses have to “absolutely” be considered in light of the added protection it is giving older people in Israel.“We should be monitoring what’s happening in other jurisdictions and gathering the evidence, whether a fourth dose or a variation of the existing vaccines is appropriate,” said Mr Daly.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has written to the National Immunisation Advisory Committee for recommendations on the next phase of vaccinations including fourth jabs.It is about three months since many nursing home residents received their third booster doses. Israel pointed to signs of waning immunity a few months after their third doses in deciding to proceed with four doses for people aged over 60 who are more vulnerable to Covid-19.Last week Dr Holohan urged caution on following Israel’s move, saying that the primary function of vaccination to protect people against severe infection “has held up really well.”He has asked NIAC to consider the scale of the next phase of the vaccination programme, including whether there needs to be booster doses across the entire population every three or four months or more targeted vaccinations for at-risk populations at shorter intervals.“We need to tease that through carefully but quickly,” he said.Frequent boostersA seven-fold increase in new Covid-19 outbreaks in nursing homes to 56 in the last week puts added pressure on a quick decision on whether fourth doses are required.The European Medicines Agency warned last week that frequent booster shots could adversely affect the immune system and may not be feasible. It has recommended that countries should leave more time between vaccine jabs and tie them to the onset of the cold season.Meanwhile, Nursing Homes Ireland has called for urgent action from the Government to address the staffing crisis in nursing homes as it published a new survey showing “a state of emergency” in the care home sector when it comes to recruiting and retaining staff.The survey of 118 care homes showed the departure of more than 1,000 healthcare assistants and 300 nurses from the sector over the past year, suggesting that up to 4,000 healthcare assistance and 1,200 nurses may have left nursing homes in that time.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"castlebar s status as the luckiest town in europe continues with lotto win","story":"The €19.06 million ticket was won in Castlebar, Co Mayo on Saturday night.

It’s the fourth time the jackpot has been won in Castlebar and it is not even the biggest win.In July 2019 the winning EuroMillions jackpot ticket worth €29 million was scooped by a syndicate which bought the ticket in Garryduff XL store in the town.The first Castlebar EuroMillions jackpot was won in April 2014 when a ticket worth €15 million was purchased at Staunton’s Costcutter Express on Main Street.Less than two years ago the ticket for the €17 million EuroMillions jackpot was sold in Castlebar. That ticket was bought in Mulroy’s Londis shop.Manager Alan Mulroy said he never found out the identity of the winner of the previous Lotto jackpot.There is a “great buzz”, he says around Castlebar and the volume of sales for last Saturday’s “must win” draw was greater than in his 28 years selling lottery tickets.He is putting out the “Welcome to Castlebar, Europe’s luckiest town” sign again on Monday in the hope that lightning will have struck twice and his will be the winning shop again.“Every second person was playing the lottery this time around. I had to go on the door to manage the queues. Whichever shop wins is going to be good for them. It’s the busiest we have ever been,” he said.Mr Mulroy added that he heard “not a thing” about who might have won it.The county’s perennial search for Sam Maguire may be one of sport’s longest running and unluckiest sagas, though having one town in the county which has won €80 million in lottery prizes brings its compensations.The elusive winner of the Lotto jackpot has yet to come forward and the National Lottery has asked players in the town to check their tickets.The details of the winning store will officially be revealed on Wednesday morning.The winning numbers for Saturday were: 02, 09, 16, 30, 37, 40 and the bonus was 23. It was a quick pick combination.As the Lotto jackpot was capped at €19.06 million, the funds from Saturday night’s draw that would usually go to the jackpot flowed down to the next highest tier at which there was a winner.The “Will be Won” event saw 149 winners at the Match 5 + Bonus tier who shared almost €5.5 million and they will now claim €36,687 each.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"man exposes himself during online vigil for ashling murphy","story":"Flowers and messages and candles are left at a memorial outside Leinster House for Ashling Murphy who was murdered in Tullamore on Wednesday evening.

The online vigil was organised on the Zoom video call platform, and attended by around 90 women on Sunday evening. During the event, a man joined the Zoom call, falsely using the name of one of the event’s organisers, through a link to the event which was posted on social media. On the video call the man exposed himself and appeared to masturbate for several minutes, before he was removed from the online event, one attendee said. The man, whose face was not visible on his camera, then attempted to re-join the Zoom call several times, and was quickly removed again each time. The virtual event was organised for people who were at high-risk from Covid-19 infection and others unable to attend in-person vigils. Several women gave speeches at the event, including singer Emma Langford, Traveller activist Rose Marie Maughan, and poet Kathy D’Arcy. The organisers reported the incident to Zoom, requesting information from the video call platform about the account used by the man.

File photograph: APPAA six-year cold-case investigation into the betrayal of Anne Frank has identified a surprising suspect in the mystery of how the Nazis found the hiding place of the famous diarist in 1944.Anne and seven other Jewish people were discovered by the Nazis on August 4th of that year, after they had hid for nearly two years in a secret annex above a canalside warehouse in Amsterdam. All were deported and Anne died in the Bergen-Belsen camp at age 15.A cold-case team that included retired US FBI agent Vincent Pankoke as well as historians, criminologists and data specialists has identified a relatively unknown figure, Jewish notary Arnold van den Bergh, as a leading suspect in revealing the hideout.Some other experts emphasised that the evidence against him was not conclusive.Investigating team member Pieter van Twisk said the crucial piece of new evidence was an unsigned note to Anne’s father Otto found in an old post-war investigation dossier, specifically naming Van den Bergh and alleging he passed on the information.The note said Van den Bergh had access to addresses where Jewish people were hiding as a member of Amsterdam’s war-time Jewish Council and had passed lists of such addresses to the Nazis to save his own family.Mr van Twisk said that following the research Van den Bergh was the lead suspect.Investigators confirmed that Otto, the only member of the family to survive the war, was aware of the note but chose never to speak of it publicly.Mr van Twisk speculated that Otto Frank’s reasons to remain silent about the allegation were likely that he could not be sure it was true, that he would not want information to become public that could feed further anti-Semitism, and that he would not want Van den Bergh’s three daughters to be blamed for something their father might have done.Otto “had been in Auschwitz”, Mr van Twisk said. “He knew that people in difficult situations sometimes do things that cannot be morally justified.”While other members of the Jewish Council were deported in 1943, Van den Bergh was able to remain in the Netherlands. He died in 1950.Historian Erik Somers of the Dutch NIOD institute for war, Holocaust and genocide studies praised the extensive investigation, but was sceptical of its conclusion.He questioned the centrality of the anonymous note in the arguments for Van den Bergh’s responsibility and said the team made assumptions about war-time Amsterdam Jewish institutions that are not supported by other historical research.According to Somers, there are many possible reasons Van den Bergh was never deported as “he was a very influential man”.Publishing historyMiep Gies, one of the Frank family’s helpers, kept Anne’s diary safe until Otto returned and first published it in 1947. It has since been translated into 60 languages and captured the imagination of millions of readers worldwide.The Anne Frank House Foundation was not involved in the cold-case investigation but shared information from its archives to assist.Director Ronald Leopold said the research had “generated important new information and a fascinating hypothesis that merits further research”.Using modern research techniques, a master database was compiled through the investigation with lists of Dutch collaborators, informants, historical documents, police records and prior research to uncover new leads.Dozens of scenarios and locations of suspects were visualised on a map to identify a betrayer, based on knowledge of the hiding place, motive and opportunity.The findings of the new research will be published in a book by Canadian author Rosemary Sullivan, The Betrayal of Anne Frank, which will be released on Tuesday.The director of Dutch Jewish organisation CIDI, which combats anti-Semitism, told Reuters she hoped the book would provide insight into the war-time circumstances of Amsterdam’s Jewish population.“The Nazis were ultimately responsible,” Hanna Luden of CIDI said. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"mi5s intervention china marks watershed moment","story":"An MI5 warning that a Chinese Communist Party agent has been operating in Westminster sent ripples of alarm across the country. But it is also notable for another reason. The Lee case represents a crucial shift in the UK’s China strategy, from denial to acceptance.This is the first time that the Government has mentioned the United Front Work Department (UFWD) being active in the UK, yet for those who have followed China closely, the tawdry details of the Lee case contain few surprises. There is plenty of evidence for how China targets businesses and politicians, or how CCP-affiliated iniduals position themselves as voices of diaspora communities across British society, whether in politics or in local community schools. What is far more interesting is the shift in the UK’s approach. Why issue a warning now? Even though Lee’s involvement in British politics has been on the radar for at least five years, British security services have previously been apprehensive about publicly linking Beijing to state activities in the UK.Take the case last year, where it was reported that at least 10,000 British citizens, including staff in virtually every government department, had been targeted by agents posing as LinkedIn recruiters. Despite intelligence agencies being confident that almost all approaches were carried out on behalf of the Chinese state, MI5’s official warning made no specific mention of China.At last, things are changing. We now recognise the value of publicly naming those trying to harm our interests. The warning shot from MI5 last week comes hot on the heels of MI6 chief Richard Moore identifying China as the agency’s “single greatest priority” for the first time in its history. And for the first time, the UK joined its allies in naming Chinese state-sponsored hackers as responsible for the attack on the Microsoft Exchange Servers, which the National Cyber Security Centre called one of the most serious cyber intrusions ever observed. The UK’s new Cyber Strategy is unambiguous. It concludes that ‘how China evolves in the next decade will probably be the biggest single driver of the UK’s future cyber security’.Public acknowledgement of China’s influence on the UK is an important step in the right direction. For those who follow China closely, this represents a much-needed closing of the gap between what we know about China, and change in British policy.When it comes to CCP interference, we are inching towards progress. The solution to the problem — in the form of the UK’s new laws to counter state threats — may still be yet to arrive. But we now have a better public understanding of how Beijing has professionalised and streamlined its UFWD work under Xi Jinping, and what that means for Britain.If we are improving our understanding of CCP interference, we now need to close that gap in other areas. Beijing increasingly relishes blurring the line between the state and society, which means we need to reassess many things which looked fine five years ago. This is wide-ranging. We need to look at the strict new laws that Beijing is enforcing on the use of data in China and ask what that means for tech companies like TikTok. We need to look at the rise of China’s digital yuan and work out what that means for the City, and whether we should move faster on plans for a digital pound. And we need to look at Beijing’s increasing control of global shipping networks and ask if Britain should pay more attention to how our goods flow through our ports.Acknowledging that UFWD targets Britain is a key moment. It makes it easier to discuss how China challenges our interests. It is an essential step on the road to a better China strategy.Julia Pamilih is Director of Research at the China Research GroupMore from NewsPolitics latest news: Nadine Dorries says BBC must fix \u0026#39impartiality problems\u0026#39 as she freezes licence feeCovid latest news: Nicola Sturgeon must scrap restrictions now Scotland is \u0026#39past the peak\u0026#39 of omicron, say ToriesCouple flushed with success after supreme court rules over loud looTwo decades of warm British winters results in half a million fewer deathsWolf Moon 2022: what time it peaks tonight in the UK and other full moon datesPictured: Horses charge through flames in Spanish purification ceremonyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uks covid cases nearly lower plan b triggered figures show worst","story":"Covid cases are approaching levels lower than when “Plan B” was triggered, with data increasingly showing that Britain is over the worst.On Sunday, cases fell to 70,924, the lowest since mid-December, before rising to 84,429 on Monday in the usual increase at the start of the week. However, that is a 42 per cent decline since the previous Monday. If the current trajectory continues, Britain will hit around 50,000 cases by the middle of the week – the same level as when Boris Johnson announced restrictions on Dec 8.The number of tests coming back positive has also started to fall, from a high of 32.3 per cent on Jan 4 to 26 per cent on Jan 11, showing that it is a true decline rather than a lack of testing capacity as some have claimed. The Office for National Statistics infection survey is also showing falls in recent days.Data show the number of people requiring mechanical ventilation had dropped to 746 as of Jan 13 – the lowest it has been since Nov 10. The number of patients in hospital with Covid in Britain has declined to 19,345 after peaking at 19,906 on Jan 10. The figures show that 44 per cent of people in hospital in England are incidental cases, having been admitted for a different reason and tested positive on arrival or shortly afterwards. There are also signs that admissions are levelling off.England’s “Plan B” restrictions are due to expire on Jan 26, and ministers hope they will not need to be renewed.Prof Mike Tildesley, of the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (SPI-M), said case figures were “cautiously good news” and he hoped the country may have a “flu-type” relationship with Covid by next winter.He told BBC Breakfast that “it does look like, across the whole of the country, cases seem to be falling”, adding: “We have had very, very high case numbers throughout late December and early January – we peaked at about 200,000 at one point.“We do now seem to be a little bit beyond that. Hospital admissions are still relatively high, albeit there is some evidence that maybe they’re plateauing or possibly going down in London, which is cautiously good news.“I would say we probably need about an extra week of data to really see the effect of children going back to school – we’re still only two weeks since children went back to school – but if we still see that over the next week or so, I’d be pretty confident that we are seeing this wave turning around.”Downing Street said there were “encouraging signs”, with the Prime Minister’s official spokesman saying the “maximum amount of time possible” would be given to prepare for any changes in the rules.“In terms of the data, there are some encouraging signs that infections are falling across the country, the spokesman said. “There are also some signs of falls – or at least plateauing – in admissions and occupancy in hospital, which is good to see.“But it still remains the case that our NHS is under significant pressure – there are over 16,000 Covid patients in hospital in England alone. So we are keeping a very close eye on the data but we do believe the mitigations we have in place – particularly our booster programme – are offering massive protection to the public.”Dr David Nabarro, a World Health Organisation special envoy for Covid, told Sky News there was “light at the end of the tunnel” for the UK.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Nadine Dorries says BBC must fix \u0026#39impartiality problems\u0026#39 as she freezes licence feeCovid latest news: Nicola Sturgeon must scrap restrictions now Scotland is \u0026#39past the peak\u0026#39 of omicron, say ToriesCouple flushed with success after supreme court rules over loud looTwo decades of warm British winters results in half a million fewer deathsWolf Moon 2022: what time it peaks tonight in the UK and other full moon datesPictured: Horses charge through flames in Spanish purification ceremonyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"downing street dodges questions over","story":"Downing Street dodges questions over Boris Johnsons secretive commuting from ChequersBoris Johnson told the nation to stop any non-essential travel on  March  - but continued to go back and forth from his Buckinghamshire retreat for days\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _Reception-at-The-Eden-Project-on-the-sidelines-of-the-G-summit-in-Cornwall.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" Boris Johnson and his we Carrie were based at Chequers at the start of the pandemicImage: REUTERSByDan BloomOnline Political EditorLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments Downing Street has dodged questions over Boris Johnsonaposs decision to travel back and forth between his country retreat and No  at the start of the Covid pandemic.The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman admitted he commuted in late March  between Downing Street and Chequers, his grace and favour mansion in Buckinghamshire, where his heavily pregnant partner Carrie was staying. He also admitted the PM then moved back to London because there was changing guidance and changing legislation coming into force, which necessitated the Prime Minister coming back to Downing Street so he could work from there. But the PMaposs official spokesman refused to give several further details - including whether they had visitors, whether Carrie threw a party, and when exactly they arrived and left. Mr Johnson told the nation to end all non-essential contact and travel on March  , before announcing lockdown on March .  On March , the government explicitly announced: “Essential travel does not include visits to second homes... whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People should remain in their primary residence. Not taking these steps puts additional pressure on communities and services that are already at risk. People were then banned by law from leaving the place where they are living without reasonable excuse from pm on March . Reports emerged on Friday that Mr Johnson commuted between No  and Chequers between March  and March . Tortoise Media revealed the commuting after Downing Street stonewalled on the questions for more than a year.It comes as Boris Johnson was battling to save his premiership after a slew of damaging stories about lockdown parties in Downing Street, including a BYOB garden party in May  that he admitted attending briefly.Have you heard from your local MP about Partygate and what they think of Boris Johnson  E-mail webnews@trinitymirror Today, the PMaposs official spokesman admitted the couple were at Chequers, and so were staff working at the manor - but refused to give further details. The spokesman said: At the time, as you know, Mrs Johnson was heavily pregnant and had been placed in a vulnerable category and advised to minimise social contacts. So in line with the clinical guidance and to minimise risk to her they were based at Chequers during that period, with the Prime Minister commuting to Downing Street to work. Quizzed by journalists, the PMaposs spokesman added: “There would have been staff at Chequers during that period as I understand it, yes.” Mrs Johnson gave birth to the coupleaposs son Wilf on April  . He was given the middle name Nicholas after the medics who saved the PMaposs le when he was hospitalised with Covid. Asked why the Johnsons went to Chequers, the PMaposs spokesman said pregnant women were strongly advised to minimise their social contact at the time. It is understood that the fact Downing Street is a busy workplace played a role in the decision. The spokesman pointed out explicit guidance on not travelling to second homes did not come in until March , at which point the Prime Minister and his we were already based in Chequers, acting in line with clinical guidance. Yet he did not mention this came after days of public debate at the time, about whether decamping to a second home broke the rules.Asked why the PM went back and forth when his we was potentially at heightened risk, the spokesman said: As youaposll appreciate the PM was leading the coronavirus response, the pandemic response, and in line with a number of iniduals who were still required to be in work, thataposs why the PM was still coming to No .The PMaposs spokesman refused to comment further on their movements, including when they ed to Downing Street. Pressed on whether the PM rushed back because lockdown laws were coming into force at pm on March , the spokesman refused to answer. Instead he said: They acted in accordance with both the guidance and subsequent legislation at all times. The spokesman said he was not aware of reports Mrs Johnson threw a hen do around that time and said they followed the guidance at all times when askedthey had any guests at Chequers. Reports had emerged of a baby shower earlier in March, days before people were told to cut social contact.

Usually these drinking sessions are sandwiched between pieces of work, so it feels like a very, very routine thing, Ms Khan told BBC Radio aposs World At One programme.Drinks could start at lunch time, they could start a little bit later in the day - dferent teams do things very dferently - but the idea of mini fridges or having drinks underneath your table wasnapost uncommon. Ms Khan said senior people at No  going back two decades had used drinks as a way of thanking staff for working very, very long hours. Askedpeople had been so hungover they had slept on sofas in Downing Street, she said: I did see a few instances of that - people waking up in the same clothes the next day. But obviously I didnapost work during a pandemic and it didnapost happen very often back then, I should say. I canapost speak for what itaposs like now. Mr Johnson was forced to apologise after it emerged his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, invited more than  members of staff to a bring your own booze party in the No  garden in May  during the first lockdown. The Prime Minister admitted he attended but argued he believed it was a work event that could technically have been within the rules. Ms Khan said: Drinks in No  ... feel like such a normalised thing so it doesnapost feel like anything out of the ordinary. Now in a pandemic thataposs totally dferent and you can absolutely say that people shouldaposve had the oversight, given that they are all so smart and intelligent. Ms Khan worked as a civil servant in No  under Mr Cameron, before working in the Treasury as a special adviser during Mrs Mayaposs leadership.She briefly remained in the Treasury after Mr Johnson took over, but was marched out of Downing Street by armed police after being sacked by Dominic Cummings in August  over allegations of leaking. She later settled a claim against the Government for unfair dismissal.Over the weekend, Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said there are plans to address the kind of culture that has allowed alleged rule breaches.This will include a crackdown on drinking in Downing Street, The Sunday Times reported. On Monday, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said Mr Johnson will set out his changes after senior civil servant Sue Gray publishes her inquiry into allegations of partying. He told reporters: I think Iaposd point back to what the Prime Ministeraposs talked about, that thereaposs a shared recognition that No  should be held to the highest standard. There are things clearly we didnapost get right and we need to take responsibility for those.

At the time of the photo England was in Step  of its lockdown roadmap - which banned indoor socialising with people not in your support bubble. Nadhim Zahawi said he hoped the Labour leader findswithin himself to apologise for the image as the Tories tried to sht focus away from their own rule-breaking parties.The Education Secretary told BBC Breakfast: I think people expect, you know, very high standards from their leaders, and I think thataposs only right.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Rather than accept any responsibility for the scandal engulfing Downing Street, he is instead likely to throw a bunch of civil service flunkies under the bus, who could now face the axe. But it comes as the Mirror can reveal Mr Johnson attended a leaving do for his defence adviser in the run-up to Christmas  and gave a speech. And fresh doubts were raised on the PM’s claim he did not know in advance about the No garden bash on May  of that year after Sunday Times columnist Dominic Lawson claimed at least two people had warned him the email invite to staff made it clear it was a party and it should have been stopped. If true, it blows his half-hearted apology for ­Partygate last week out of the water and means he faces claims he breached the ministerial code by misleading the Commons. To add further pressure on Mr Johnson, his we Carrie was photographed breaking Covid social distancing rules in September .Have you heard from your local MP about Partygate and what they think of Boris Johnson  E-mail webnews@trinitymirror The PM will hide behind claims he is to crack down on the “culture” at No in his bid to deflect any blame. Those who could be singled out for blame inclde his PM’s principal private secretary Martin Reynolds – who sent the May  party invite – his deputy Stewart ­Glassborow and chief of staff Dan Rosenfeld. But Mr Lawson’s claims suggest Mr Johnson knew more about the parties than he let on. The well-connected columnist said: “Last week I spoke to a former Downing Street official who said at least two people had told the PM, after seeing the emailed ­invitation from Martin Reynolds that this was ‘a party’ and should be immediately cancelled. “I was told that Johnson’s dismissive response was to say they were ‘overreacting’ and to praise Reynolds as ‘my loyal Labrador’. I then asked someone who has known the PM for decades what could have made him take such an approach . “His immediate answer was: ‘It’s because deep down he obviously thought the regulations were ridiculous, so why should he observe them ’”  No insisted: “It is untrue that the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance. “As he said earlier this week he believed implicitly that this was a work event.” We can reveal Mr Johnson gave a speech at an event to mark defence adviser Captain Steve Higham’s Downing Street departure before Christmas in . It is understood the PM was “there for a few minutes to thank him for his service” as a “small number of No staff briefly said goodbye”. The MoD declined to comment. Our revelation could give senior civil servant Sue Gray more material to consider as part of her probe into the Downing Street parties. Tory chairman Oliver Dowden signalled civil servants would take the rap for the rule breaking parties.He said: “The PM is ­determined to make sure that this can’t be allowed to happen and that we address the underlying culture in Downing Street. There were failings, we should have done better.” The Mirror told on Saturday how Mr Johnson attended some “wine time” Friday events at No.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.

As the Home Secretary insisted the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill will stop people apospreventing children from getting to school, and ambulances getting to hospitalapos, activists held signs which read, aposKILL THE BILLapos. The Home Secretary seemed un-phased as the signs began to flood the Zoom screen. She was speaking to a group of young Tory activists remotely last week, and joined by Tory MP for Carshalton and Wallington Elliot Colburn. The pair were holding a QA session for young blue campaigners wishing to learn more about up and coming Conservative policies. But Mr Colburn became increasingly agitated as the call went on - saying: I have no idea how these lefties got into the call.  After Ms Patelaposs y opening speech he opened the call for questions - but the questions were more than the two MPs bargained for. A member of the Green New Deal Rising group made a surprise appearance in the QA session, asking why Ms Patel was pushing this bill - which will jail some protesters for six months - through Parliament. She said: We have freedoms in our country and weaposre very, very proud of our freedoms. But actually, we are changing our laws... to stop disruption to our way of le and disruption to our economic way of le as well. And certainly in the two years where Iaposve been home secretary, weaposve had the streets of London, weaposve had streets of other cities, that have been brought to a grinding halt. Weaposve seen children not being able to get to school. Weaposve seen people stranded in ambulances when they desperately needed to get to hospital. That is why we are bringing our laws in. Everyone has the right to protest and the freedom to protest that is the right of our democracy in our open society. But alongside that, there are legal ways of doing that and right and proper ways of doing that and causing the type of harm and disruption that we have seen has been very, very counterproductive, I feel as well, and the police will talk about this very vocally, in terms of police resourcing the cost of them when they could actually be spending their time protecting our streets and protecting the vulnerable people that actually need help and support.  But as the QA was coming to an end and hundreds in the call werenapost able to get their questions in, campaigners flooded the Zoom chat and screen.A source from the group told the Mirror: They zoom bombed Priti Patel to make it clear to her the kinds of things we want introduced in the bill.We want to be able to raise our voices - thataposs part of a ing democratic society. One campaigner questioned: Why did you put me in prison for drumming at a protest  Another asked: Would you have arrested the suffragettes for being too disruptive  And seconds later, the chat was flooded with the slogan aposKILL THE BILLapos. Nervous Mr Colburn wrote in the chat: Apologies to those of you who genuinely came here to ask questions. I have no idea how these lefties got into the call. I will be asking CCHQ to review how they monitor who is let into these calls.A Home Office source told the Mirror: Itaposs not going to rank very highly on the list of UK protests. She would have happily spent the entire session answering questions and explaining why we are doing what we are doing. It comes after protesters took to the streets across the UK to decry the police and crime bill which is reaching its final stages in parliament.On Saturday, Labour peer Baroness Chakrabarti told a crowd at Parliament Square: “This right-wing, authoritarian Government used to encourage pro-Brexit demos and statue defenders when it suited them. “This Government bangs on about free speech and whinges about cancel culture. “It talks a good game about China and Russia and every other place in the world where fundamental rights are under attack. “But free speech is a two-way street. “And do you know what  The ultimate cancel culture, it doesn’t come with a tweet – it comes with a police baton and a prison sentence for non-violent dissent.”Former labour leader Jeremy Corbyn added: “This sense of disempowerment is designed to have a depressive effect, particularly on young people.”As it stands, the bill would put protesters at risk of y prison sentences and hefty fines for actions that cause “serious annoyance”, which could be done just by making noise, and for anyone found guilty of damaging a statue or memorial. Amendments added to the bill by the Government in the House of Lords in November make it a criminal offence to obstruct major transport works or attach oneself to objects or people, and would equip police with the power to ban named iniduals from demonstrating or even using the internet to encourage others to do so. Labour members in the House of Lords tweeted that they will be “opposing protest clauses added late on” to the wide-ranging bill in Monday’s votes. Peers are in for a marathon session tonight as votes are set to go on until the early hours of Tuesday morning.

No Prime Minister is able to survive for long in high office when they trigger scorn in every home, workplace, cafe and pub. A mate of mine, a retired welder in a red wall seat, sent a reworking of a joke about a dead man at the Pearly Gates and was informed by St Peter the hands on heavenly lie clocks ticked only when fibs were heard. The pointers on those of Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela had never moved. “Where’s Boris Johnson’s clock ” inquired the man. “We’re using it as a ceiling fan,” replied St Peter. Sacricing the jobs of Downing Street staff to save his own skin will not work for Johnson. It feels like when nothe is booted out of No  by Tory MPs worried about their futures. Nor is he able to cower in a fridge again as the glass door on the front of No ’s wine-time Friday cooler symbolises the charlatan having hidden in plain sight for too long.  Suitcases of booze smuggled into Downing Street, drunken shenanigans on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral and an unprecedented apology to Buckingham Palace have a last days of Rome vibe to them. Labour leads of up to % in the polls are encouraging the opposition to go for the jugular, Keir Starmer justiably accusing the PM of breaking the law and lying. With jilted insider Dominic Cummings orchestrating much of the onslaught, there’s an irony in Johnson as co-author of his own downfall. Labour is aware it should target the Tories as much as Johnson himself when as rising star Wes Streeting acknowledged, the opposition’s best bet’s a mortally wounded PM limping on or the Conservatives will claim they have changed under Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

But deaths are still up % in a week to , - and , people were admitted to hospital with Covid yesterday alone. Rules on isolation in England, and Omicron restrictions in Scotland and Wales, are all being relaxed slightly.That has fuelled hope that in England, Plan B - with Covid passes for nightclubs and work-from-home guidance - will end on January .AskedPlan B will end on time, Boris Johnson ’s spokesman said today: “There are some encouraging signs that infections are falling across the country, we would want to see that mirrored in the latest ONS data as well. “There are also some signs of falls or at least plateauing in admissions and occupancy in hospital, which is good to see.However, he warned the NHS is still under signicant pressure and “we are keeping a very close eye on the data”.It’s also been reported that compulsory masks in shops and public transport, another part of England’s Plan B, will be extended. Here are the rule changes taking place from today.Covid isolation cut to five full days in EnglandThe Covid isolation period in England has been cut to five full days from today.Previously people who tested positive for Covid couldbe freed midway through their seventh full day of isolation, they test negative on days six and seven. That period has been cut by between  and  hours, after huge pressure from Tory MPs and a staffing crisis in theNHS .Under the new rules, people in England with Covid must isolate for at least five full days. They will then be able to leave isolation at the start of the sixth full day -they have tested negative for Covid on both Day  and Day .Your first full day of isolationstarts at .am, the calendar day after you test positive or show symptoms.Soyou test positive at am, aposDay apos starts  hours later.This means the new total isolation time is, in reality, somewhere between five and six days depending on what time you went into isolation. UK Health Security Agency data shows around two thirds of positive cases are no longer infectious by the end of Day . This rises to %people have two negative lateral flow tests,  hours apart. In Scotland and Wales, the isolation period is still seven days . Booster vaccines for - and -year-oldsAll eligible - and -year-olds are able to book a Covid booster jab from today.Previously, boosters were only recommended for clinically vulnerable  and -year-olds who are most at risk fromCovid- . But recent data from the UKHSA showed two doses were not enough to stop people becoming unwell fromOmicron . More than , in the age group in England have had their second jab, so will be eligible for a booster. However, not all are eligible now, as they still have to wait until three months since their second dose. About , teenagers are newly eligible now, and many of the rest should become eligible in the coming weeks. Omicron restrictions rules relaxed in ScotlandScotlandaposs limit on football matches and other outdoor events has been scrapped from today.Football matches and other outdoor events in Scotlandwere limited to only  people from December ,meaning Boxing Day games were effectively fan free and Hogmanay festivities were axed.That -person limit has now been axed.

Organisers of events with more than , attendees will be expected to check the Covid status of at least half of those arriving. From today, punters will only count as fully vaccinatedthey’ve had a booster, unless their second dose was less than four months ago. This change has not yet happened in England, where there’s speculation Covid passes will instead be axed on January . Other restrictions - including a limit of  people at indoor events, or they are standing - remained in place with a further review this week.  PLUS… Omicron restrictions relaxed in WalesThese aren’t technically ‘from today’ but they’re worth including anyway.

HMRC figures released last week show £. billion was stolen from pandemic relief schemes such as furlough and self employment support by people claiming cash they werenapost entitled to. A taskforce set up to claw back cash recovered £ million last year, and is expecting to recover an additional £ billion from scammers. This means the Treasury only expects to recover £. billion - or £ of every £ taken - by fraudsters. The figures, first unearthed by the Times, were quietly published last week. Labour branded the figure outrageous and said the Government should have been able to help support workers without losing billions of pounds of taxpayersapos cash. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the Mirror: These confessions are outrageous. While prices soar, billions in hard-earned taxpayer cash has been frittered away by fraud - and the Chancellor is happy to shrug his shoulders and lose it forever. It shouldn’t be beyond the wit of government to get money where it needs to go, without allowing fraudsters to steal taxpayer funds. Leaving the till open and unattended for thieves to clear out would be a sackable offence for a shopworker, yet apparently it is acceptable for a Chancellor. And Shadow Business Minister Bill Esterson tweeted: You can bet this Government wouldn’t be so casualit was benefit claims. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: We introduced these unprecedented Covid support schemes at speed to protect jobs and livelihoods. The result of the action is our economy is back to pre-pandemic levels, we are the first major European economy to report that. He added: Obviously fraud is unacceptable and weaposre taking against those who abuse the system - , ineligible claims blocked, £ million recovered last year, HMRC taskforce is expected to recover an additional £ billion of taxpayersapos money. HMRC boss Jim Harra admitted last year that all the money would likely never be ed. “We will not be able to recover it all, he told the Financial Times. You will reach a point of diminishing s in terms of good use of resources. “These are time-limited schemes. We do need to put them to bed at some stage and move on from them. And   is the year for which our plans go up [to]. Whether there’s anything that goes on beyond that will depend, I think, on what we find and the rate ofthat we’re getting.

The self-isolation period has now been cut down to five days, but this isnt the case for everyoneCovid self-isolation rules have changed again in England Image: Getty ImagesBySurena ChandeSEO Editor:,  Jan | comments While the number of positive Covid cases in the UK continues to remain high, there has also been a % drop in cases compared to early January. However, with the highly transmissible Omicron iant continuing to cause work absences as people are forced to self-isolate, the government has now reduced the number of days youaposll need to isolate for.Just days before Christmas, the government slashed the number of self-isolation days from  to just seven when sufferers tested negative on both days six and seven.And now, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has announced that the self-isolation period will be five days. Though, itaposs important to note that there are several exceptions to this and you should still remain cautious, according to experts. Hereaposs everything you need to know about the governmentaposs new rules. How long do you need to self-isolate under the new rules in England, and how does it work now In an overhaul to Covid self-isolation rules, the government now states people living in England may leave self-isolation after five full days, whether they are vaccinated or not.However, in order to leave self-isolation following five full days of self-isolation, people will need to take a lateral flow test on day five and then  hours later, on day six.  Both of these lateral flow tests must be negative in order for those self-isolating to be allowed to head out again.  If the lateral flow tests show a positive Covid result on day five or six, people must continue to self-isolate. You may then leave isolation after testing negative on two consecutive days, or after  days. According to the UK Health Security Agency , two-thirds of positive cases were no longer infectious by day five. While it is less likely for people who leave self-isolation on day six to be infectious, people should take precautionary measures to avoid the risk of transmitting Covid to others.  Sajid Javid said reducing isolation to five days would restore extra freedoms and reduce the pressure on essential public services over the winter. Those who were self-isolating should continue to wear a face mask, work from homethey are able to and try to keep a safe distance from others when in crowded spaces. Those in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales must continue to self-isolate for at least seven days. When does your first day of self-isolation start  Under the current rules, which were introduced on Monday, January , , the day Covid symptoms begin to develop or the day that you test positive is classed as day zero.  You must begin to self-isolate on that day, but your first full day of isolation begins at .am the next day. As the new rules require you to self-isolate for five full days, you will then need to test negative on day five, which is six days after your symptoms and test positive. You will then need to test negative again  hours later, on day six, to leave self-isolation.

Dr Prit Buttar, , revealed how he willingly breached social distancing measures to give a heartbroken pensioner a hug at a vaccine clinic during the second lockdown of .The retired GP, who ed to work during the pandemic, was vaccinating the woman in Annan when she said her husband had just died of cancer. Moved by her sadness, the doctor reached out and held her as she wept in his arms and told him that his hug was the first time anyone had embraced her since her husband’s death. Now Dr Buttar is comparing his own rule-breaking with the the Prime Minister after he was left feeling guilty for just wanting to be human.He told the Daily Record : I did what I felt was the right thing to do when breaking the rules, but to see the leaders of our country twist their drinks parties to be justied is appalling. “People have had to make serious choices when going against Covid rules and I have been feeling guilty for just wanting to be human. “We follow the restrictions because it is the only way out of this and most people, like myself, take that seriously and would only break themthe situation seriously called for it.“So to find out Boris Johnson and others have been having get togethers, and then give us terrible excuses for them, just tipped me over the edge to share my experience.Dr Buttar admitted that he has felt guilty about breaching the rules every day, but was unable to help himself as he watched his patient struggle in her grief. The Scot, who lives near Kirkcudbright, recalled how she spoke of her loneliness during her Covid vaccination appointment just one week after her husbandaposs death. The woman, in her s, had moved from England to Scotland with her husband just before the outbreak of the pandemic but he fell ill a short time later. She was unable to make any friends in her new community during lockdown while busy caring for her sick husband, meaning she was alone when he died.  Dr Buttar added: The bottom line is as I am a doctor and believe in science so I follow the rules but seeing this poor woman, I had to do something. I could tell she wanted to talk, so I abandoned my usual spiel about the vaccine, possible side-effects, and just listened. “She had been so wrapped up in caring for her husband over the past year, she hadn’t had a chance to make friends with local people, something worsened by the first lockdown. “She had dealt with his death and funeral arrangements alone, so I decided to break the rules about social distancing. The health professional recalled leaning forward in his chair and putting his arms around the grieving widow. She clung to me and wept, and sobbed into my shoulder and said aposthis is the first time anyone’s embraced me since he died.’ “I still believe it is so important to follow the rules but I felt this situation called for it.  Dr Buttar has vaccinated almost , people but said this moment really stuck out to him. “I didn’t take comforting that woman lightly just like most other ordinary people who are trying to face our painful reality,” he added. The doctor decided to share his experience and the serious choice he made after being left outraged over the news of the Downing Street parties. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has apologised for attending the Bring Your Own Booze gathering but insisted he thought it could have been technically within the rules. Dr Buttar said: “I came out of retirement to help with vaccines because I have a duty and obligation to help people, which is what I did with this woman. Alsosomeone had challenged me for breaking the rules and fined me I would look them in the eye and askthey wanted cash or a cheque, I would have taken responsibility for my actions like our Prime Minister should now do. He added: To see our leaders and their staff party while we faced this has left me beyond angry.

Toni Estevez moved into a refuge with her children when a previous relationship broke down before being moved into a flat.Despite being told they would ‘soon’ be moved into a house, the -year-old and her children Rene, , Amari, nine, Kayden, seven, and Lilly, three, are still waiting, reports Birmingham Live.Rene and Kayden have asthma and Toni has had to rush to AE  times after one of them has been left struggling to breathe. She puts this largely down to the mould and damp they are having to live with in their draughty first-floor flat. Toni said: There’s mould and mildew in the flat, I’m constantly cleaning. “The walls are wet to touch and you can feel a breeze coming into the sitting room windows. It took us six months to get the shower fixed as bits of concrete kept dropping in every time you washed. “I have been bidding on properties since  but for some reason I was put down as needing a five bedroom property, I’ve been fighting this for two years saying that I qualy for a four bedroom property. This has finally been changed now so I’m hoping there might be some more options available to me now. Have you been on the housing waiting list for years  If so email webnews@reachplc  “I would love the kids to be able to use the garden but it’s just not possible. It gets very hot in here in the summer. I just have to rely on the children being able to run around during their playtime at school. “I take them to parks and for picnics as much as I can but it’s hard. “When we first moved in, the housing officer said you won’t be here very long and I’ve held onto that but it’s been so long now, it’s heartbreaking.” When the family first moved in Toni promised her children they would have a new house by the next Christmas -four years ago.  She added: “That first Christmas I told my children we’d not be here next Christmas just to give them a little bit of hope - we’ve now spent four Christmases here. “Little Kayden wrote a letter to Santa at school to say he was going to be extra good and could Santa please give us a home  “I saw it and realised I’d got to stop vowing to my kids that we will move into a home because they are starting to think it’s something they are doing. Kayden grabbed me and hugged me really tight the other day and said, ‘MummyI promise to be really good will we move ’ “This journey has been an emotional rollercoaster. We just want somewhere we can call home.  When you’re homeless you don’t even get spoken to like you’re human. Because you’re in temporary accommodation people make assumptions about you. It doesn’t make me feel great, I’m not homeless through any choice of my own. “I feel like we’ve been left and forgotten about.” A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: We are sorry for the distress caused to our tenant by the damp and mould in their flat. A contractor will visit the property to survey the problem and treat it. We are experiencing a national housing crisis and as Britain’s largest local authority this has resulted in very long waiting list as demand for our homes far exceeds supply, particularly for larger properties. The tenants housing officer will be in contact with them to discuss their housing options in line with the council’s allocation policy including renting in the private sector which is currently the quickest way to find a larger property.

The identity of the photo takeraposs thumb has never been revealed and remains unidentied.It comes as Andrew was said to have been left in tears when his mum stripped him of his honorary military titles after a US judge ruled a civil case in New York against Andrew by his sex accuser Ms Giuffre can go ahead. Andrew strenuously denies any wrongdoing. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.He was said to be utterly devastated by Her Majestyaposs bombshell decision.It came just a fortnight after the Sunday People exclusively revealed the Queen would reluctantly strip her son of his prized roleshe did not resign.A senior defence source said: “The Prince was tearful when told the news even though he had expected it. He feels that he has let so many people down, not least his mother, during her Platinum Jubilee year.” Our insider said of the royal’s ­dramatic demotion: “He had hoped that he might get some sort of stay of execution and be allowed to clear his name before his titles were removed.  “There are a number of people in the royal household who are utterly convinced that he is innocent. “But the clamour for Andrew’s scalp meant that a quick and brutal decision needed to be made.” The move, announced in a shock Palace statement on Thursday, left Andrew exiled from official royal le and facing le as a private citizen.  He is also expected to cover his own legal costs for the civil case. He was also told he will no longer be able to use the title of His Royal Highness in any official capacity. The move came after years of damaging speculation arising from Ms Giuffre’s claim she was forced to have sex with the duke three times when she was , including once in London.  Andrew’s plight worsened when his former friend Maxwell, , was found guilty of offences relating to her work as fixer for the Dukeaposs associate Jeffrey Epstein, a conviced paedophile and billionaire.The Duke of York has always denied the allegations and tried to explain his links with Epstein by doing an interview with BBC Newsnight where he claimed he has no recollection of ever meeting Ms Gufre. She alleges that the photo was taken at Maxwellaposs house in Belgravia, central London after a night out at Tramp nightclub in Mayfair. She claims that she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions. In a disastrous BBC Newsnight interview in , the Duke denied those claims. He insisted that an alleged encounter in  did not happen because he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey. A source close to Ms Giuffre’s legal team has now claimed she is determined to “ruin him” because of his “arrogant” behaviour. “No one can believe how badly Andrew and his legal team have messed up. His arrogance is what has destroyed him,” they said. “It is Virginiaaposs firm belief that Andrew should go to jail for what heaposs done but in the end leaving him broke and destroyed may be enough. He is already destroyed.  “Now itaposs a matter of how much money he offers [in a settlement] and how broke we leave him.” Andrew has not been arrested or charged in respect of any criminal offence and has always strenuously denied the claims.

Michael Hulme booked the £, four-day package stay through Hays Travel, in Newcastle.He told Stoke on Trent Live he had paid for the break in monthly instalments leading up to the trip in March last year.But when the -year-old and his partner Kerry Barlow arrived at The Gallivant Times Square hotel in the Big Apple, hotel staff told him their room had not been paid for. The  bill was then taken from Michaelaposs bank account after he used his card to pay a  security deposit. This left him with just  on his card to spend on sightseeing. The grandad-of-five promptly contacted Hays Travel, who told him he would receive a refund within  days. But it meant he couldnapost afford to pay for attractions - such as Top of The Rock - and was forced to ask family to lend him some cash. The Abbey Hulton security guard said: The trip was a surprise for my partner and a once-in-a-letime break as it was somewhere she had always wanted to go. I paid for the package holiday in monthly instalments and it was all paid up by March, . But when we got to the hotel they said our room had not been paid for. I told them I would ring the travel agent up the next day and I paid a  security deposit for the room. When we got up the next day and went to do a bit of shopping my card kept getting declined and I couldnapost understand why. When we got back to the hotel and checked the banking app it said the hotel had taken  from us.  I went to the reception and they said they had taken the money to pay for the room. They said not to worry and that they would reimburse the money when the travel agent had paid. I got in touch with Hays Travel and they said by the looks of it, the holiday had been cancelled and re-booked. But as far as I was concerned it had been paid for. If it had been cancelled why were we still told we could still go on the holiday I think it may have been cancelled and re-booked because ofCovid.But the travel agent said they would look into it and see what was going on.At pm reception rang us. They said the travel agent had sent the payment through and I had been reimbursed - but it can take up to  days. We were only there for four days and couldnapost wait  days, that was our spending money for attractions. I only had  left on my card. Thankfully I had  in cash that we could use for food. Michael says he suffered panic attacks after realising they had been left with just  for sightseeing and tourist attractions. He was forced to ask his partneraposs brother for money so the couple could carry on enjoying the trip. He received the refund after arriving back home, but says the break was spoiled by the money worries and he feels let down by Hays Travel. Michael said: I suffer a bit with depression and my anxiety kicked in. You go all that way expecting no problems, but we were stuck out there in this situation and my partner was in tears. I was in a right mess, I didnapost know what we could do. I rang the travel agent and they said sorry, and askedthere were any friends or family members that could help us. I canapost go round asking my children for money. Youaposre talking £ or more and I know they havenapost got that kind of money. We got in touch with my partneraposs brother and he sent us  so we could continue doing the ious things we wanted to do in New York. We still missed half of the attractions we wanted to do because we couldnapost afford it. I spoke to the travel agents when we got back because I was still fuming. Someone should be held responsible for what happened to us. Iaposm not going to use Hays Travel again. It was very stressful and I donapost want anyone  to go through the same thing. It just spoiled the holiday. Hays Travel has apologised to Michael and handed the couple £ as a gesture of goodwill. It says it was unaware of the issue until Michael called them from New York. A spokesman said: We were extremely sorry to hear of the mix-up regarding Mr Hulme’s hotel arrangements. We arranged for him to receive a full refund, plus compensation, as quickly as possible. Hays Travel has blamed the hotel for the mistake, but the hotel says the reservation had been cancelled on March  last year. The Gallivant Times Square hotel said: This reservation was cancelled by a third-party website on March , .

Pete Broadhurst, , splashed out £, on a cosmetic procedure to fix his puffy cheeks in . But, even after corrective surgery, his left eye is still permanently open - causing him constant problems. Pete has to tape his eyes shut when he sleeps and use drops eight times a day to prevent them drying out. He says he looks frightening as his eyes stay open even when he wants to close them - and claims his appearance has cost him relationships. Pete, a retired painter and decorator, is speaking out now to warn others about the dangers of surgery.  He said: Getting on the bus one day a man said, aposmy God, whataposs happened to your face apos. I was already feeling down it just made it worse. Now Iaposm only worried about getting my eyes comfortable. Itaposs gone beyond how I look. I just want relief. I want to tell others to be careful because it can ruin your le. Peteaposs problem started in , when he had a class  occlusion to fix a tooth problem which led to him having enlarged cheeks. He said: I had puffy hamster cheeks. Years ago I was in a relationship with a girl and we had two children and she was leaving me. I said, aposwhy are you leaving when weaposve got everything  Look at how lucky we are.apos And she said, aposgo look in the mirror, thataposs why Iaposm leavingapos.  After two further relationships where his insecurities about his looks grew, Pete decided he wanted to get corrective surgery. So, the father-of-two, from Four Oaks, Birmingham, decided late in  that he would go in for a procedure. He approached BMI The Priory Hospital, who quoted him £, to undergo a neck lt, under eye blepharoplasty and a rhinoplasty that would help reduce his cheeks. And, on January , , he underwent the nine-hour procedure, and was discharged the next day. Pete said: I looked like Iaposd been beaten up. It was horrendous, and I couldnapost close my eyes. Iaposm being sick all through the night and in my sleep. The day after the surgery I wished Iaposd never gone. Pete claims he was vomiting and couldnapost pass urine but just took these as the normal after effects of surgery.  The following Monday, after leaving the hospital, Pete had a catheter fitted, thinking initially it was to do with his prostate. But he now believes that his problems passing urine were due to spending an elongated period of time under general anaesthetic where he couldnapost go to the toilet. He ed to the hospital two weeks after the surgery to get the stitches removed, and told the medics that his eyes were very irritated and watering. But Pete claims that they told him all was normal and these side effects would pass by themselves. He then went to the Good Hope Hospital on March ,  to have a routine prostate exam. But the doctor noticed his damaged eyes - and he was referred to Birmingham and Midland Eye Centre. There they told him his eyes weren’t closing fully when he blinked or slept causing him irritation - a common complication of eyelid surgery called ectropion. However, the doctors there couldn’t treat him as he had the original surgery privately, so he ed to BMI. His surgeon arranged for a free corrective surgery at BHI Parkside for a skin graft to help the skin in his cheeks meet his eyelids.  He had the hour-long surgery on May , . But, more than two years later, Pete claims he still canapost fully close his left eye - and the right one is completely shut. He said: My eyes were distorted, I could barely see at all. Sheaposd lted my left eyelid up and my right eye had a blinker in the corner. It never improved again. I was unable to see and at night I still had to tape it shut. Pete has been prescribed eye drops to take eight times a day, and was told to microwave a towel to wrap around his eyes for when he sleeps. His vision is now so poor he canapost drive a car or make out peopleaposs facial expressions, and has had to give up his hobby of shooting as he canapost see the target.All private hospitals have since refused to provide any further surgery as they could exacerbate his vision issues, and the NHS had a year-long waiting list.This has meant Pete felt forced to go abroad, resulting in a £, lower eyelid blepharoplasty at the Clinic Mono in Turkey.He saw the surgery advertised in the newspaper as where Katie Price goes, and is due back there later this year for a follow-up procedure.Pete said: My left eye is still open today. Whoever you trust, even a top surgeon, please be careful because it can ruin your le. A BMI Healthcare spokesman said: We can’t comment on the detail of inidual cases, but we are committed to the highest standards of patient safety and care quality and are investigating this matter thoroughly. The surgeon in question is currently suspended as we are mirroring an NHS trust suspension. Lindsey Sharp, from BHI Parkside, said: BHI does not provide healthcare. It provides space to NHS, private consultants and other healthcare professionals to undertake services they are qualied to provide. The surgeon who performed Peteaposs surgery at BHI Parkside declined to comment as she cannot share confidential information about patients.

The Prince of Wales has expressed his firm wish to spend quality time with his grandchildren, having not seen Archie since he was six months old and not ever meeting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s baby daughter, Lilibet Diana, who was born in June.The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and his we Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood.But Charles’s good natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation. It was thought that Harry and Meghan would certainly make an effort to attend events to celebrate the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee in June.What do you make of our exclusive story  Have your say in the comment section Harry is understood to have told family members he would attend a memorial service for his late grandfather Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey, which is planned for April.However, it has emerged that the Duke of Sussex claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the royal family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. Harry, , has since decided to sue the British government by applying for a judicial review against the decision, which could see him face the Home Office at the court. Royal sources have confirmed the Prince of Wales has held several “good natured and enjoyable” video calls with his son, Meghan and the children during the past few months.

One source said: “The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn’t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss. “He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it’s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his le without the ability to get to know Harry’s children. “This is something he is hoping to remedy which is why he made the gesture for Harry, Meghan and the children to stay with himthey wanted to, whenever they may come home for a period of time. “In the meantime there has been a series of good natured and enjoyable calls between them all which is something the prince very much looks forward to.” In the calls Charles, , has made it clear to his son of his wish to spend quality time with two-year-old Archie and seven-month-old baby Lilibet. Harry’s relationship with his family is understood to have been fractured following his exit from The Firm in , and subsequent decision last year to appear with Meghan, , in a tell-all interview with US chat show queen Oprah Winfrey. The couple beamoned their treatment by the family, with Harry accusing his father of cutting him off financially and further claiming a senior member of the family made racist remarks about the colour of his unborn children’s skin. Sources close to Charles have told The Mirror that despite reports of the two not speaking, Charles and Harry have been on “a journey of rediscovery” in terms of their relationship.  One said: “The Prince of Wales has spoken to his son frequently in recent months. He loves him very much, as he does both his children, and he looks forward to them being able to spend time together in the near future.” Harry and Meghan, now live in an £million mansion in the millionaires’ playground of Montecito, Calornia, have not spent any time out of the United States since their move in . Harry is however also expected to attend the Invictus Games, which he founded, in The Hague, the Netherlands, in April.Since their exit from the family they have signed deals worth an estimated £million with streaming giants Netflix and Spoty, with the capability to earn hundreds of millions of dollars having become “financially independent”.Clarence House did not comment.

The Duke of Sussex’s unprecedented move of threatening to sue the government is both breathtaking and utterly baffling. Those in royal circles have almost universally questioned the play at hand, not only in its nature but equally in execution. True enough, with his background in the military and his position in one of the most famous families in the world – and celebrity lestyle – Prince Harry and his family are arguably high profile targets.  But to suggest he is at a greater risk at home than abroad, where he has chosen to base himself, surely holds very little weight. Indeed the manner of this row seems even more bizarre that it is still being argued two years on from being granted his wish to up and leave his royal role, on the understanding that you can’t have everything you want. This is all before even considering the effect on the Queen, who we are told has been made aware of her grandson’s latest bright idea just as she emerges from one of her most tumultuous periods of recent years. She faced her first Christmas without her beloved husband before wielding the axe on her son Prince Andrew’s royal career.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... The decision to banish him into the wilderness, arguably a couple of years behind schedule, would not have come easy no matter the depths of his fall from grace. Now, just three weeks away from the beginning of her Platinum Jubilee year, Her Majesty is facing down another petulant member of her family for reasons she would be forgiven for assuming had been sorted.

He suggested a new name for the venue as Johnson is facing furious calls to resign, following reports of at least  parties across Downing Street, Whitehall and Tory HQ while millions suffered under lockdown rules. Johnson is accused of attending at least four of the events.Covid-bereaved families have blasted the bashes, and No’s repeated attempts to obscure the truth before the PM finally apologised.Daniel’s pub was previously named The Three B***ends and featured a collage of Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings with bells on their heads in October ,reports.  It was said to be a tongue-in-cheek protest at the Government’s handling of the situation when the Liverpool City Region was placed into Tier Three lockdown, forcing pubs to close. The pub was once again renamed in November , called “The Two Helmets” following Mr Cummings’ departure from Downing St. The image outside of the pub showed the PM and his former health secretary wearing hardhats, as the landlord protested about continuing restrictions on the pub-trade. Daniel pointed out that both Mr Cummings, the PM’s former chief advisor, and Mr Hancock, quit their positions within weeks of the signs going up. “Next name change for the pub ” his tweet asked.  “The first was The Three B***endsNext was The Two HelmetsSo. Two down one to go!” Daniel said the first rebrand was prompted by the government blaming the leisure sector for the spread of Covid-. He previously said his business had been “decimated” and their lack of action had compounded the problem. He said: “Westminster’s further decision to pick and choose which types of venue may open, based on those serving meals for example, is mind-boggling. ‘Whilst the renaming of the pub is clearly tongue in cheek, as far as I’m concerned the gloves are off and ministers need to understand the gravity of the perilous situation they have placed us in.  This is a town that finally feels like it’s on the up and we need funding immediately to protect our businesses and support our staff. Top civil servant Sue Gray is probing a range of the Downing Street parties, spanning May  to April , and is expected to publish a report within days. At the time of all these gatherings, indoor socialising was banned to control the spread of the virus.But ultimately the Prime Minister will get to decide himselfhe has breached the Ministerial Code. Johnson is reportedly planning to force out a string of top staff to save himself in what has been dubbed Operation Big Dog.Speaking to the media today, Conservative party chairman Oliver Dowden said the Prime Minister is remorseful about allegations of Covid rule-breaking and would seek to “address the underlying culture in Downing Street”.There had been failings in No , he admitted, though he denied it was a resigning matter for Boris Johnson.

The family lost their taxpayer-funded security when the quit the royal family in  and use a private alternative for their new lives in the US. Heaposs wants pay for police assistance when heaposs in the UK - in line with the coupleaposs plan to become financially independent - but the Home Office has rejected this. Harry has now applied for a judicial review against the decision.Ingrid Seward, author of Prince Philip Revealed and Editor in Chief of Majesty magazine, tells the Mirror his latest move wonapost have gone down with the Queen - who is currently dealing with the fallout from Prince Andrewaposs legal case. She explains: Prince Harryaposs threat of legal action against his grandmothers government will not sit kindly with her. The Queen does not like being threatened. Even though the threat is not directed at her personally, it is a threat that comes under her jurisdiction. It will make her annoyed and very irritated. She has no desire to alienate the Duke and Duchess of Sussex , butthey continually behave like spoiled children trying to get their own way, she will be forced to do so. As youngsters both Harry and William knew exactly how their Police Protection Officers operated. They became close to them. They were together every time they left home. One even sat outside the classroom. They were friendly, efficient and unobtrusive. No wonder Harry wants that kind of protection for his we and children. But he is very unlikely to get it. Many have been left wondering what Harryaposs request will mean for his future trips to the UK, with many hoping to catch a glimpse of the Sussexes during the Queenaposs Jubilee celebrations in the summer. Ingrid says: Harry is due back to the UK in the Spring for the service of thanksgiving for the le of his grandfather, Prince Philip. He will be protected during this official engagement at Westminster Abbey. ButHarry and Meghan choose the celebrations of the Platinum Jubilee weekend to make an entry into the UK, as things stand at the present, they will not have round the clock Scotland Yard protection - unless they are with other members of the royal family. If for instance they appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony they would be afforded all the security necessary along with everyone .But when they drive home to Frogmore Cottage, their private bodyguards will be responsible for them.Once there, they are the responsibility of the Windsor Castle security. The police at Windsor recently apprehended an intruder who had climbed over the security fence. If the Sussexes don’t get their own way as regards their demand for police protection, they may decide not to come to the UK. In spite of the fuss their security risk is low. What they want is protection from photographers trying to get pictures of them and their children. The more they shield their children from public gaze the more of a target they will become. Harry’s father should tell them to let the world see Archie and Lilibet’s faces. After they are his grandchildren too. It is not up to the -year-old Queen to tell Harry how to behave. What would this do for the already tense relations within the family  If it means she never gets to meet Lilibet, it will become Harry and Meghan’s problem for the rest of their lives. And that would be very sad.

Another image shows the words burn Tory scum written along the same wall in similar style. The graffiti comes just days after a US court ruled that Virginia Giuffre, who claims that Prince Andrew abused her when she was , could proceed with legal action against him.Prince Andrew has strongly denied the claims. Buckingham Palace released a statement last Thursday saying that The Duke of York would be ing his military titles and royal patronages back to the Queen.Rory Richmond, a law student from Glasgow, posted a photo on Twitter Sunday of the graffiti aimed at the Conservatives.He wrote: “This was photographed at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh earlier today.“We must condemn and confront the mindless acts of vandalism and hatred.” The tweet has received over  likes and has had dozens of comments and retweets.Social media users were outraged by the graffiti. One wrote: “Appalling vandalism.

The move means Andrew has been completely removed from official royal le and he now have to face his future as an ­ordinary citizen. The Duke of York was informed that he will no longer use the title of His Royal Highness in any official capacity by the Queen on Thursday. The decision was made after hours of deliberation between senior members of the Firm. But the summit is said to have not been straight-forward, with his lawyer left in the car park and the Prince left stunned by the outcome. Among the key revelation from the meeting, was news of a united front from Prince Charles and Prince William, who were reportedly of the view that the Duke of York has presided over a complete and utter disaster.” Andrew is also said to have been unaware about the plans, with sources describing him as shell-shocked at the move.

Thereaposs no doubt the month of January can be hard for many. There are some who look at is as a time for fresh starts, a time to embark on new endeavours and challenges.But for many itaposs completely miserable. Our bodies are still recovering from Christmas over-indulgence, our wallets are feeling the pinch and many have put strict restrictions on themselves. The warmth of summer is still far away, and although weaposre not in lockdown still, weaposre in the middle of a worldwide pandemic. But why is today, of all days, known as Blue Monday  Here is everything you need to know. What is Blue Monday  Blue Monday is supposedly the most depressing day of year, due to a number of factors. It usually falls on the third Monday of January every year, although it can also fall on the second or fourth. The first Blue Monday was marked in  when the idea was conceived by le coach and happiness consultant Dr Clf Arnall.  He was asked by travel firm Sky Travel, who anted to promote their winter deals, to work out he most depressing day of the year.Clf published a formula to work it out using factors such as the weather, debt, the amount of time elapsed since Christmas and since we failed New Yearaposs Resolutions, as well as general feelings of low motivation.The psychologist believed this formula could be used to predict when people would be poking trips to sunny holiday destinations. Although originally a PR invention, it is now an annual event. Is Blue Monday really the most depressing day of the year   Since coming up with the formula, Dr Arnall has since urged Brits to refute the whole notion of Blue Monday. He told The Dailyin  that it is not particularly helpful to put that out there and say ‘there you are’,” going on to describe Blue Monday as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Despite being picked up by PR companies all over the world, the formula has also been debunked by several members of the scientic community. Many have suggested there is no way you could assign numerical values to factors such as weather.

Peggy, who did not give her surname, said she did not notice the world famous artist had graffitied her home until reading about it online.The painting shows a man in a balaclava using a crowbar to ply open a piece of wood which covers up a previous Banksy piece.The original graffiti shows a small child catapulting a sea of red roses into the air. It appeared in February  in Barton Hill, but was vandalised the following day. Vandals scrawled BCC w**** across the mural which was subsequently boarded up with plastic sheeting placed over the flowers. Peggy told Bristol Live how she did not spot the new addition to the graffiti because she does not tend to walk in that direction from her house.She said she did not hear anybody creating the new piece, although she did hear somebody painting the first artwork from inside her home. Banksy confirmed the original artwork was his the day after it appeared, but he is yet to claim the latest addition.

The couple had no idea the secret room was there, until they spotted rotten floorboards and decided to investigate the cause. On exploring the hidden cellar, the couple found it was flooded with water and rubble, so -year-old Ben decided to put it on the backburner while renovating the rest of the property.

Ben, who works as a sign maker, said: There was some issues with rotten floorboards and the person I bought the house from wouldnapost let me explore any further until we had moved in. I had an incline something was hidden underneath after noticing a lot of the houses on our street had cellars and steps leading down. I took a gamble and guessed where the stairwell would be and managed to cut the hatch out and found a flooded cellar.  It was in terrible condition there was a foot of water and rubble. It was rotting the floorboards and joists so I had to replace all of them. I saw it as an exciting bonus despite the fact it needed a lot of work. When work finally began on the hidden room, the couple decided to transform the old cellar into a state of the art home cinema and playroom for one-year-old daughter Bella.  They spent £, on transforming the old, rotting cellar into a home cinema complete with a custom made sofa, projector, and bar area. Ben added: I shopped around and used a lot of secondhand materials. I made my own system to pump out the water so Iaposve managed to save a lot of money by doing the work myself. The work started in October  but was only recently finished as it was an ongoing project. Thereaposs a large l-shaped lounger, shelving racks, popcorn machine, sweet vending machine, a mini fridge, a projector, and a bar area. Itaposs around  square metres and a fully ing room which weaposre happy we discovered.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Mike Burke, , a metal detectorist, had been walking past a potential treasure trove but he was never allowed to dig it up as his we, Julie, had forbidden him.But one day she decided to replant the garden so gave Mike special permission to scour through the area for gold - and he seized the opportunity, as Cornwall Live reports.He didnapost expect to find anything, so was amazed when he pulled out a gold ring, believed to be a Roman intaglio ring, dating back to around the st or nd century AD. What do you think about Mikeaposs impressive find  Let us know in the comments...Mike, from St Just, Cornwall, said: I don’t normally have permission to go metal detecting in my front garden, because my we’s got a lot of flowers out there. But I decided since everything was dying back and we were getting ready to rake everything up – I was like, it’s no problem, she won’t mind me going in there.  Next month when she starts planting seeds again, I won’t be able to do it again, so it was now or never. First Mike found a two pence coin from the ‘s, then a halfpenny from the same decade, and a tin teddy bear that looked like it had been part of a baby’s rattle, each item as worthless as the next. But then, he got a solid hit on his metal decetor so he started digging.  He continued: Around six to  inches down, I noticed a little fleck of gold – well, something that looked like gold. I didn’t knowit was an old bottle top or something because I find them all the time. But when I pulled it out, it was a gold ring. Every day I look at this and I still get a shiver, you know, I just can’t imagine that I found something like this. Mike and Julie’s terrace cottage was built in the s on a riverbed, so it could be that the Roman intaglio ring was dropped, buried, or offered into the river somewhere upstream. Mikeaposs discovery has now been passed on to Cornwall’s Finds Liaison Officer, Tasha Fullbrook. Mike spent  years in the US Army as a military police officer, including seven years as a prison guard in military prisons, and he turned to metal detecting to unwind. He continued: It helps me relax. I stick on the headphones – evenI’m outwith a group of  other people – I stick on the headphones, go walk around a field and I’m all by myself in peace and quiet except for the beeps and bops that are coming off the metal detector.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

My dad confessed he was in love with the other woman and wanted to leave my mother, the woman wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum. She obviously heartbroken and didn’t know what to do, as we had moved to a new state with my father for work so she had no family around. My father dropped us like a bad habit, he attempted to keep a relationship with me, but ultimately his new family was aposhis priorityapos as he said. Tough to understand for a  year old, but whatever. If he didn’t want me, I wasn’t going to need him so my mother and I moved on. The only way we were able to move on was with the help of my grandmother, my fatheraposs mother. She always loved us and was appalled with what her son had done to us. He stopped seeing her as well for the most part. Over the years, the woman and her mum became increasingly close with her grandmother, often spending special occasions and holidays together, while her dad was nowhere to be found. Unfortunately, the years caught up with her and she developed colon cancer, advanced late stage. Her decline was rapid. Within a few months she was in hospice, the woman continued.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Days before she passed, she asked me to call her son to come see her as she knew her time was coming. He’d only been to see her a couple times since she had gotten sick. When he came by, I was visiting as we did every few days and he acted like I was some random person. Grandma asked him to come back tomorrow, but he said he’d be back in a few days. She passed  days later without him coming back despite my calls and texts to come. She went peacefully with me and my mom by her side. That was hard. I miss her every day. She was myangel most of my le and I know she continues to watch over me. After the funeral and everything took place, the woman and her mum were contacted by her grandmotheraposs lawyer, who revealed she had, in fact, left both her home and , to her in her will. I had no idea she did that, but in the will, there was a note to me from her that said: aposYou are worth it. Love Grandma.apos She’s amazing, the woman added. Also in her will, she left my father exactly  as his inheritance. When he found out, he went ballistic, blowing up my phone all the time demanding I give him aposhis house and his money.apos His new we and his son were messaging me a lot and his son was writing on social media that I manipulated my grandmother. Eventually, the womanaposs father apologised for his behaviour and explained he was under a lot of stress because heaposs in debt and was expecting a windfall from his mum to help cover his bills and send his son to college, leading her to feel bad and question whether she should share the money after all. Iaposve thought about it a lot and I don’t think I’m going to share anything with him and I kind of think that makes me an a**hole because it seems like they really do need it, but on the other hand f*** him. One Reddit user replied: The reason she left him  was to make it clear to the Court in case he tried to challenge the will, that she hadn’t forgotten to include him, but that she intended to disinherit him. She knew that her son would try to take the money she left you. It is very common practice to leave  when disinheriting someone. Respect your grandmothers wishes and don’t give your father a dime. A second wrote: The reason your grandma gave him exactly  is so that he couldnapost contest it. She did not want him to gain anything from her passing. She knew what she was doing. Honour her wishes.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Bosco is only -weeks-old but he has already grown into quite the powerhouse and is so enormous his owner struggles to hold him in her arms. Comments on the video sharing  were filled with people totally baffled by the young dogaposs size - and speculating about just how big he could grow to be. In the clip viewers see the beautul puppy gazing adorably into the camera, as his owner battles to hold him up. Meanwhile big Bosco flashes an adorable grin at the camera and licks his lips, likely expecting a treat for being such a good boy. The clip, which was uploaded by TikTok user @bossdiggitydawg, is set to the popular Blink- song ‘What’s My Age Again’ matching Bosco’s bewildering size.The video was a hit on the app, with over , views and more than , likes. Viewers were clearly amazed by the dogaposs size, with one user commenting: “He’s going to be built like a horse.” Another commenter wrote: “He is gorgeous. He is going to be between  to  lbs. My last Rottie was  lbs at six months and weighed  lbs at two years old.”  A third added: “That’s a classic Rottie bear cub right there. Lol. Handsome boy. He’s going to be huge.”Another Rottweiler called Pluto went viral on TikTok recently as he left viewers sobbing after showing how a dog might greet their owner in heaven.The video captured hearts as Pluto was seen bounding towards his owner through a field as emotional music played. Viewers were left imagining that this might be what it looks like to be greeted by your dog in heaven. In another adorable video Harper the Rottweiler was totally unimpressed when her clumsy brother, Hudson, showed a complete disregard for social distancing and took a seat directly on her legs and backside.Hudson, who is a Bernese mountain dog, is clearly lacking in self-awareness when it comes to his size, much to the dismay of his sister.

Dubbed TOI- b, the planet was found by Citizen Scientist Tom Jacobs using data collected by Nasa’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite . The gas giant orbits its stars in just  days- compared to Jupiter which takes around  Earth years to travel around our Sun. The discovery was reported in the Astronomical Journal. Tom found TO having taken part in the Planet Hunter initiative which looks at the collected data. He spotted something irregular in February  and flagged it to two scientists, who later confirmed the find. He said: “Discovering and publishing TOI- b was a great group effort demonstrating that professional astronomers and seasoned citizen scientists can successfully work together.  “It is synergy at its best.” Scientists say the planet is around  lightyears away from Earth and has around  earth masses of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Around , exoplanets have been confirmed with billions more suspected to be in our galaxy. Paul Dalba, from the University of Calornia, Riverside, added: “The manual effort that they put in is really important and really impressive because it’s actually hard to write code that can go through a million light curves and identy single transit events reliably,” “This is one area where humans are still beating code.” It comes as an asteroid bigger than any building on Earth is set to soar past the planet tomorrow.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said: “Our national security efforts rely on aerial supremacy and these phenomena present a challenge to our dominance. “The United States needs a coordinated effort to take control and understand whether these aerial phenomena belong to a foreign government or something  altogether.  The new Unidentied Aerial Phenomena programme was launched after a number of high profile videos were released by the Pentagon - many including US military chasing targets pulling off impossible manoeuvres and speeds. The move has upset many ufologists who believe the truth about possible visitors have been hidden from the masses for decades.Ron James, a spokesman for the Mutual UFO Network, said: “We donapost see that this means new resources will be dedicated to the matter.“We believe that considerable resources have always been dedicated to the matter at some level inside deep government and industry.” It comes as a UFO spotter who monitors the International Space Station’s live feed claimed to have proof of aliens’ existence.

And while some dogs might enjoy a quick game of fetch, others don’t realise when their owners have thrown the ‘invisible’ ball.But Tipsy goes the extra mile - quite literally - to chase her beloved ball.When her owner Jessi Burk, from London, in Canada, showed Tipsy her ball, she stopped dead in her tracks, paws poised and ready. Jessi threw the orange and blue ball over the other side of the sheep fence, and Tipsy - who’s been trained not to go over or through the fence - set off in a sprint in the opposite direction.  Taking the long way around, Tipsy ran through the gate, down the path and around the trees to retrieve her ball, ready for another throw. Other dog owners have shared how their dogs would have behaved in the same situation - and they’re vastly dferent to Tipsy’s marathon around the farm. One said: “My malinois would simply bulldoze the fence.” Another added: “My Doberman would stand at the fence and bark at the ball… for hours.”  One suggested tying string to the ball and pull it back when it almost gets there to seethe collie would run all the way back around. The two-year-old dog isn’t the only sheepdog to offer the internet a good giggle in recent months, either. Lucy Jones’ short-coated border collie is a talented herding dog, but had everyone in stitches after ‘pulling the wool’ over their eyes.In a TikTok video viewed nearly a million times, the collie sits perfectly still in the sheep barn, surrounded by his woolly workmates.But the dog is wrapped up in sheared sheep wool with just his little head poking out, hoping that no-one will notice that he’s an imposter. And where, farm dog Marshall loves his job so much, he herds whatever he can get his paws on - including his favourite football. His owner, Lisa Alekna, shared an adorable video of the dog stalking a ball in the garden whilst patiently awaiting for instructions from the shepherdess. She instructed him to ‘walk up’ and ‘stand’ as Marshall continued creeping towards the target.The farmer explained to Marshall’s TikTok viewers that the clever dog would ignore commands he didn’t want to do, until Lisa offered him a better instruction.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Red Cross said it was preparing to respond to what it called the worst volcanic eruption the Pacic has experienced in decades. Up to , people could have been affected by the tsunami, according to Katie Greenwood of the charity. One British woman was reported missing after trying to save her dogs with her husband and getting washed away by a wave. Angela Glover, who runs a dog rescue shelter on the island, was swept away with the animals while her husband James managed to hold onto a tree, according to New Zealand state broadcaster TVNZ. Tsunami warnings and evacuation orders were also triggered in neighbouring countries, including Japan and the east coast of Australia. Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Haaposapai has erupted regularly over the past few decades but the impact of Saturdayaposs blast was felt as far away as Japan and the United States. Australia and New Zealand sent surveillance flights on Monday to assess damage in Tonga, isolated from the rest of the world. Initial reports suggest no mass casualties took place form Saturdayaposs eruption and tsunami, according to Australiaaposs Minister for the Pacic Zed Seselja. But Australian police had visited beaches and reported signicant damage with houses thrown around.  We know there is some signicant damage, and know there is signicant damage to resorts, Mr Seselja said adding that Tongaaposs airport appeared to be in relatively good condition. Surveillance flights will assess the situation in outer islands where communication is completely cut off. Tongaaposs deputy head of mission in Australia, Curtis Tuaposihalangingie, asked for patience as Tongaaposs government decides its priorities for aid.The nation is concerned about the risk of aid deliveries spreading Covid- to the island, which is currently free from the virus.We donapost want to bring in another wave - a tsunami of Covid-, Mr Tuaposihalangingie said. When people see such a huge explosion they want to help.  He went on to highlight how Tonga diplomats were also concerned by some private fundraising efforts and urged the public to wait until a disaster relief fund was announced. Any aid sent to Tonga would need to be quarantined, and it was likely no foreign personnel would be allowed to disembark aircraft, he said. The eruption of the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Haaposapai volcano triggered a tsunami on the shores of Tonga and cut off phone and internet lines for the entire island. International communication has been severely hampered by damage to an undersea cable which could take more than a week to restore. Australia and New Zealand were assisting with satellite calls, he said.  Telephone networks in Tonga have been restored but ash was posing a major health concern, contaminating drinking water. Most people are not aware the ash is toxic and bad for them to breath and they have to wear a mask, Tuaposihalangingie said.The Haaposatafu Beach Resort,  miles outside the capital Nukuaposalofa, was completely wiped outaposapos, the owners said on Facebook.The family that manages the resort had run for their lives through the bush to escape the tsunami, it said. The whole western coastline has been completely destroyed along with Kanukupolu village,aposapos the resort said. Two people drowned off a beach in Northern Peru due to high waves caused by the tsunami. More than a day after the eruption, countries thousands of kilometres to the west have volcanic ash clouds over them, New Zealand forecaster WeatherWatch said. Early data suggests the eruption was the biggest blast since Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines  years ago, New Zealand-based volcanologist Shane Cronin told Radio New Zealand. This is an eruption best witnessed from space, Cronin said.

It’s important in cementing a local community together and stopping rural depopulation.“These are definitely exceptional circumstances.

debate new ways of funding” the BBC but has not detailed the Government’s preferred alternative.The annual payment usually changes on April  each year will be kept below inflation at the current rate of £ until April .vw,vw,px, px\"– What is the licence fee Any household watching or recording TV programmes at the same time they are being broadcast must have a television licence.This applies to all forms of transmission including using the iPlayer on smart television, laptops and tablets.It was introduced in June , when television broadcasts resumed following the Second World War.– How much is the licence fee A standard TV licence is currently £.The annual BBC licence payment normally changes on April  each year and is set by the Government, which announced in  that it would rise in line with inflation for five years from April  .However, Ms Dorries has announced that the licence fee will be kept at the current rate until April .This holds it below inflation, meaning a real-terms cut in funding at a time when the BBC is facing substantial financial pressure.– What does it pay for The licence fee pays for TV, radio and online programmes and services including iPlayer, Radio , CBeebies and the World Service.It also funds Welsh language TV channel SC and local TV channels.It is reported to be worth around £. billion to the BBC.BBC presenters such as Dan Walker and Gary Lineker have been sharing a graphic on social media showing the dferent BBC TV and radio channels supported by the fee.– What alternatives are there – Voluntary subscription feeAn ally of Ms Dorries quoted by the Mail On Sunday said  to -year-olds are watching “YouTube, Netflix and videos on demand – they don’t watch the BBC, and shouldn’t be forced to pay for it.”A subscription fee would attempt to mirror the systems used by streaming giants such as Netflix and Amazon Prime..removeIt would allow those who want BBC content to opt in.However, it would face technical challenges because of the range of services offered by the BBC, with free-to-air broadcasts on radio and terrestrial TV dficult to place behind a pay wall.It could also result in either a drop in funding for the BBC or a subscription fee that is higher than the licence fee.– AdvertisingThe BBC does not have advert breaks on its domestic TV channels and its website is free from advertising.However, abroad both services carry adverts with the income used to “help fund BBC services and keep the licence fee lower than it otherwise would be”.The BBC could follow in the footsteps of ITV and Channel  and start hosting advertisements.But there are suggestions this could encourage the broadcaster to focus on programmes that bring in viewers and lead to revenue at the expense of programmes that serve smaller groups.Former BBC chairman Lord Grade ruled out advertising, telling BBC Radio ’s Today programme it would “impoverish ITV, Channel Four, Channel Five, etcetera”.He added: “The pot of advertising is not going to expand to meet the BBC’s needs.”– Direct funding from the GovernmentAs an alternative to the licence fee, the Government could support the BBC financially through an annual grant.Questions have been raised over how this would affect the broadcaster’s editorial independence.– Introduce a broadband levyThe BBC has looked at funding its services through a levy on broadband connections.The existing licence is levied on the TV, the device historically used to consume BBC content, but the more modern equivalent would be the internet.In , the corporation told the Government it was “open to exploring this further”.This would be easier to enforce but may not satisfy critics who would prefer a system that allows people to opt in.– A combination approachFormer media minister John Whittingdale is among those who have proposed a mix of the above options.Mr Whittingdale has suggested a “core” BBC comprising its public service broadcasting such as news and children’s programming could be funded by the tax-payer, while a Netflix-style subscription service could fund its big budget dramas..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: What

That aside, it was a strong year for the driver.Argyll rally fans are looking forward to a full  season, Covid permitting, in conjunction with Dunfermline Car Club and the new main title sponsors Burnside Piling.CAPTIONS:Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen CR MAX.

can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early hours of Tuesday and into the afternoon, Kintyre took a battering, and wind gusts were recorded as  mph at Machrihanish at pm by the Met Office.Islay is reported to have been as high as  mph around the same time.Roads were closed in some areas due to debris from beaches and the sea washing onto the road, with some buildings suffering structural damage.The lead from many of the Ugadale Cottages at Machrihanish was blown off and Machrihanish Golf Club also received damage to the course caused by the sea washing seaweed and debris onto the course.Electricity was off for most of Tuesday for West Kintyre and a lot of damage was caused to properties at the Sound of Kintyre.The road outside the County Garage in Campbeltown was shut for most of Tuesday and boulders washed up onto the A at Tangy Beach causing the road to be shut temporarily as cars were struggling to get by.Four people were rescued from Davaar Island, near Campbeltown, on Monday afternoon after being trapped by the

the London Boat Show, which opened at Earls Court on Thursday, January .Taking local food to the show is part of a drive by two local enterprise companies to promote the wealth of fresh produce available all from Scotland#s west coast and help boost links between tourism and food and drink.Top Argyll chefs and others from farther afield will be preparing a range of mouth-watering dishes utilising the area#s products including oysters, venison, scallops and meat from Scotland#s only snail farm based in Tayinloan.In addition, there will be new products from the area including trout caviar, goat#s cheese and fortune cookies.Argyll and the Islands Enterprise, along with Lochaber Ltd, is staging up to seven cookery demonstrations a day at the -day show, which is expected to attract more than , people.A recipe booklet has been prepared and will be handed out to visitors to the Sail Scotland stand which features the AIE and Lochaber Limited #Feast of Nature# display.As well as demonstrations, visitors will be able to sample oysters at a specially-created oyster bar and a range of other foods.Speed cameras could be installed on Argyll roads in a bid to cut down on speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet. There were no incidents of breach of the peace, assaults and so on.All was peaceful on Islay too.No public houses or hotel bars were open to the public on New Year#s Day, which undoubtedly helped to keep everything quiet.There was one New Year#s Day incident. A van belonging to the Redfusion television company struck a wall on Low Askomill. Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

It#s so heartening to experience the children#s energy, enthusiasm and awe when learning about whales and dolphins.Our sessions are so important as they spark passion and interest in the local environment and encourage conversations about the actions that we can all take to help protect it, now and in the future.Players of People#s Postcode Lottery have supported the charity, raising £, since  to support the development and delivery of new and immersive learning experiences that bring the marine environment to le for children in coastal communities.Our latest creative project, funded by People#s Postcode Trust and Sea-Changers, has been to launch the best of their education sessions online, working with schools and home educators across Scotland and England.Based around the trust#s research expeditions, these digital sessions introduce the amazing ersity of whales, dolphins and sharks in Scotland and give children a glimpse into what it is like to work at sea, studying and protecting ocean giants.Prior to the pandemic, every year school groups would join the charity#s crew on board their research vessel, Silurian, as she was temporarily transformed into a floating classroom.The famous yacht has now visited communities on most of the larger Hebridean islands including Mull, Skye, Islay, Lewis, Harris, Uist, Barra, Coll, Tiree and the Small Isles as well as some of the largest towns along Scotland#s west coast, such as Oban, Mallaig and Ullapool.Raising awareness and aspirations for green careers features at the centre of the charity#s education strategy.Each year the trust runs dedicated research expeditions for - and -year-olds on board Silurian.These young adults gain hands-on experience monitoring marine le, including collecting data as part of the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust long-term citizen science project, which informs local and national conservation efforts.Anyone can help the charity monitor marine le, by reporting their sightings of cetaceans – the collective name for whales, dolphins and porpoises – and basking sharks online.The trust also offers guided field trips for schools, so that younger children can take part and experience the thrill of spotting seabirds and marine mammals from land.Local wildle is not only amazing to see, but each species also has an important biological role to play.By protecting whales and giving marine ecosystems the chance to recover, we can improve the health and resilience of our seas and in turn the climate and planet for us all.We#re really proud to support the next generation of ocean ambassadors and look forward to when Silurian can once again become a floating classroom and set sail for island schools.In the meantime, teachers or home educators keen to take part in our online sessions are encouraged to get in touch by emailing info@hwdt.org"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 7 2022","story":"He followed a very dferent path.

Some years, the harvest had been better than others, and some trees gave their fruit easier than others. He’d learnt not to expect a good harvest, but hope for one, after caring for the trees in all the ways he’d learnt.But he knew what the problem was. The trees were old. He had pruned them and cared for them in all the ways he knew, but now was the time to plant new treeshe was to enjoy an abundant harvest in future years.But where to plant  He walked about his garden trying to decide the best location.He was a very lucky man, it was an extensive garden and his le’s joy. He knew what was needed, the type of soil, the position so there was enough sunlight, sheltered so the spring buds would be protected from the chill winds. Then he realised the perfect place to create his new orchard: close by the wall at the far end of the garden.He wanted to plant from seeds, and he used the technique his grandfather had taught him so many years ago. So he set to work, first preparing the soil, and then he began planting.The trees would grow up together and help each other to flourish, he thought.Years went by and his new trees did indeed grow. Passers-by would often see him standing admiring their progress.But there were some unkind whisperers in the village, who said mocking things about the old man and his new apple trees.“Does he not realise he will be dead before those trees bear fruit  What a foolish man to waste his time and energy on something he will never enjoy himself. If he had children it might make sense, but he doesn’t.”The unkind whispers of course reached the old man’s ears. But it didn’t stop him standing by the new trees and admiring them, and helping them in the ways he knew, to grow healthily. As each year went by, the new trees got bigger and stronger, but the old man got weaker.Then one spring, he was unable to venture into his garden to admire their blossom. People noticed his absence and they wondered about him.Soon the news was out: he was very ill. One of his neighbours came to see him.They had been le-long friends and every autumn the old man had shared his apples with her, giving her a large basket of them to share with her big family.It was sadly their last meeting, for the old man passed away before the beginning of summer. When autumn arrived, the apple trees he’d planted bore their first fruit. It all seemed so sadly ironic.But then one day during the autumn, the neighbour’s grandchildren came running into her house, looking excited.“Gran, gran, look!” they called out, holding a handful of ripe, juicy-looking apples.“They were lying in your garden, on the grass over there, can we eat them ”She went to look. The old man had planted the new apple trees close to the low-lying wall where they had always had their conversations.It was the place where they had made and maintained their friendship, always talking and catching up.It was at this wall that he would hand over the basket of apples every autumn.Now the apple trees he’d planted had grown tall, and some of the branches arched above her lawn. The trees seemed to be offering her apples.She realised now why he’d planted the seeds there.Then she noticed that some of the trees were growing by the old man’s other wall, which bordered the main road.The old man used to leave a basket of apples by his gate for the children as they were walking to school. Now the trees arched over the grassy verge next to the pavement, displaying their fruit.They were just out of reach, butthe children were inventive and cooperated with each other, they could find ways to pick them.She reached up and picked a ripe-looking apple, just the way he’d taught her all those years ago when they’d first become friends. She looked at it and smiled.She looked over the wall to the place he used to stand when they had their conversations. She would never see him standing there again, she thought, never have those conversations again.But then she looked at the apple she had picked and smiled. Her sadness lted and she looked at the trees.“You’re still here,” she said quietly to the rustling branches, “and you’re still sharing your apples with everyone.”"},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-author-creates-special-books-grandchildren","story":"Alex Brown, , is celebrating the self-publication via Class Moustache Publishing of the tales of

fall asleep and that Snoozlewhoosh takes them on amazing journeys in the magical world of dreams.”He was advised to trademark Snoozlewhoosh by a friend in the publishing industry, who said the character sounded like something Roald Dahl might have created.Mr Brown said: “Hearing this made me smile and I began to believe I could write and create a book for each grandchild at the very

Green,  at Fentoun Meadow and  at Marine Rise.A further  are planned for the Saltcoats Field site.A crossing patrol guide was in place at Main Street but has not been operational since August last year.Gullane Primary School’s junior road safety officers – Ella Wilson, Hannah Carter and Josh Spink, all in P – have written to the community policing team and East Lothian Council to ask for help making roads safer to walk to school.Josh said: “It’s very simple – more kids run the risk of death. They need to be looked after on the roads.”Hannah added: “Without a lollipop person, I feel quite unsafe when crossing the road.“I don’t like crossing without an adult and most children feel the same.”A council spokesperson said: “We’re aware of the issues being raised by the parent partnership and our officers are meeting with them regarding their concerns.“We are continuing efforts to recruit for a new crossing patrol guide for this location, as well as several others within the county.“Crossing patrol guides play an important and visible role in providing safe routes to school.“However, all road users have their part to play by driving to the conditions and speed limits in place.“We work closely with the police for their support in dealing with speeding and inappropriate driver behaviours, which are within their remit.”The school’s parent partnership spokesman said that there were several spots in the village where speeding traffic was a particular problem, including Main Street, Muirfield Drive and also Fenton Road.Of the latter, he said: “CALA have put up a couple of speed bumps and they’re going to be putting up more, so they have responded but it took a lot of pushing to get them to do that.”Derek Lawson, strategic land director with CALA Homes , said: “In Gullane, all of our developments include pedestrian connectivity to the existing network, promoting walking to and from school, and speed reducing measures on the public road network.”And the parent partnership had a message for drivers in the village: “Be aware that children are crossing those roads, running beside them, and stick within the speed limit.”"},{"url":null,"title":"success-local-schoolchildren-musselburgh-msps-christmas-card-competition","story":"Mr Beattie, who

However, for the period immediately ahead, it is also prudent to remain careful and cautious.”More information on restrictions being eased is likely to be confirmed in tomorrow’s Covid update.The First Minister’s Covid update will be streamed on the Scottish Parliament Tv section of the website which can be found here.It will also be live streamed on the social media accounts run by the Scottish Parliament, including Facebook and Twitter.Furthermore, the update is likely to be broadcast on major news channels. "},{"url":null,"title":"giant-asteroid-bigger-worlds-tallest-building-fly-past-earth","story":"Called  , the asteroid is macross and is larger than the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khala in Dubai, which is m .But the asteroid poses no threat to Earth and at its closest will pass more than five times the moon’s distance from the planet.Robert McNaught discovered asteroid PC at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia on August  .Nasa’s Asteroid Watch Twitter account posted: “Near-Earth #asteroid  PCis very well known and has been studied for decades by our #PlanetaryDefense experts.“Rest assured,  PC will safely fly past our planet . million miles away next Tues, Jan .”The agency’s Planetary Defence Coordination Office monitors the skies to find, track, and monitor near-Earth objects.Nasa is also looking at ways to intercept potentially hazardous asteroids with its double asteroid redirection testmission.The mission aims to prove a spacecraft can autonomously navigate to a target asteroid and intentionally collide with it, smashing it off course."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12800707.jpg?type=article-full","title":"runs-scotland-investigation-scotlands-corridors-power-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access to the people and organisations with signicant influence over so many aspects of our lives. From the hundreds of secret lobbying meetings to who really runs Scotlands wind farms, whisky and media - the investigation will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.Hundreds of meetings between Scottish ministers and multinationals, wealthy iniduals and other influential organisations were left off the lobbying register in  due to loopholes in legislation, The Ferret can reveal. Analysis of Scottish Government ministers’ engagements in  shows that meetings, potentially of key public interest, were not in the register, including those between ministers and companies awarded multi-million pound UK and Scottish contracts to supply the NHS in the run-up to Covid-.  Read the full scale of unrecorded discussions here.Professional lobbyists, including former politicians, advisors and a former minister have met with Scottish Government representatives on behalf of clients  times since March , The Ferret can reveal. Scotland is home to dozens of public relations, think-tanks and consultancy firms, including several formed by or employing people who served in the upper echelons of government. Find out the whos who of professional lobbyists here.Questions have been raised over the power and influence of energy companies following analysis by The Ferret revealing how key sectors dominate Scottish lobbying. The Ferret categorised  organisations that lobbied Scottish Government ministers since the register was introduced in  to increase transparency. Read the full exclusive analysis here.Big business including oil and renewable energy, farming, fishing, finance and whisky dominated Scotland Office ministers’ meetings last year, analysis by The Ferret has found.   We looked at all external meetings logged in  by Alister Jack, Secretary of State for Scotland, UK Government ministers for Scotland David Duguid and Iain Stewart, as well as Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross, who was deputy Secretary of State until he resigned in May that year.   Read the full report exclusively here.The number of companies registered in tax havens investing in Scotland over the last decade has increased by nearly  per cent. Analysis of Scottish Government data by The Ferret found that in  there were  firms registered in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and British Virgin Islands operating, compared to  in .

We, the electorate, are not stupid and last time I checked it was still our countryJohn Murdoch, Innellan.* ALASDAIR Gallowayasks why those of us who do not support Scottish independence do not place the same burden of proof on our case as we demand from nationalists.The answer is quite simple: the nationalist proposal is a hypothetical projection, while the status quo is an observable reality. We can see and record what happens and what has happened in the UK as it is , but it is up to the nationalists to show that independence would be better, and how that could come about. There is currently no proposal for independence on the table, so it is quite legitimate to ask for one so that it can be scrutinised accordingly.He also asks why any future proposal that may be produced should be subject to a higher level of electoral approval than in  or . Obviously he sees the Brexit vote as great success, but I think we should look to other countries like the United States, where two-thirds is the required vote for constitutional amendments, or to Switzerland, where they require a majority of all cantonsA simple  per cent + victory does not fulfil the purpose of a referendumbut makes underlying isions more permanent and more bitter.Mr Galloway cites domestic precedents in his defence of a simple majority in these matters. However, unIike him, I do not believe that the British way is always the best way of doing things, especially in constitutional matters.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.NO MORE BRANCH MANAGERSMARK Openshawdetails the many steps available in a free society to bring a recalcitrant politician to heel or justice, in this case the Prime Minister of the UK. This is true of all democracies which have evolved over hundreds of years. Democracy as we understand it today is underpinned by the rule of law and in Scotland the legal system can be traced back to the th century, perhaps slightly older than the English legal system. There are many countries able to trace their democratic roots back in time, although Mr Openshaw appears to allude to real democracy being the preserve of “our islands”.If Scotland became independent, it is clear Mr Openshaw would not be supporting the SNP because of its “omerta-like intolerance of internal dissent”. I think the dictionary definition of omerta might be better applied to the governing party at Westminster with all its alleged dubious contracts to “friends” during the Covid crisis.Mr Openshaw need not worry needlessly about who to vote for in an independent Scotland as he will be able to choose from a number of political parties. These are sure to include existing political parties now independent themselves. With the constitutional question having been settled, from a currently bare cupboard the Conservative and Labour parties might be able to come up with a policy or two which would benefit the new Scotland – they might even get elected as the governing party.No longer would the Tory leader in Scotland be regarded as a Tory “lightweight” by his betters in London or the Scottish Labour leader as a “branch manager” for a single MP sitting in London. What’s not to like Alan M Morris, Blanefield.NATURAL REACTION TO EMPIRE BUILDERSALEXANDER R McKays obsessive hatred of national independencequalies him to join the company of many celebrated figures from history.The Romans viciously suppressed independence movements, the Habsburgs and the Romanovs were angered by them, Napoleon hated them and the British regarded them with indignation. The Ottomans failed to understand them and the Nazis ruthlessly attacked them in France, Belgium, Holland, Greece, Norway, Denmark and any of the other countries they invaded.All these frenzied empire builders have been swept aside by history and independent nations have became the accepted normal.As soon as people began to question the morality of empire building and international plundering, residual sympathisers went on the defensive and, by a spectacular inversion of the truth, condemned \"nationalism\" or \"separatism\" as the cause of all political problems. Any examination of history shows that, on the contrary, the pursuit of national independence is just a natural reaction to the arrogant greed of empire builders and conquerors. They all eventually discover its power but cause incalculable damage before they do.Peter M Dryburgh, Edinburgh.* REBECCA McQuillandisplays the head-in-the-sand affliction widely demonstrated by journalists and commentators who do not seem to understand the dference between the terms nationalism and nationality.She accepts the increasingly obvious fact that the UK Conservative Party is now an alien force in Scotland and that the Labour Party in Scotland is severely hampered by its stubborn unionist stance but continues to maintain that there is virtue in avoiding \"separation\" from England. Eventhe bitter pill of Brexit were to be swallowed without complaint, federalism or devo max, both of which would continue to treat Scotland as a region rather than a nation, will never satisfy the aspirations of the emerging generation among which so many identy their nationality as Scottish rather than British their voting choices are driven by nationality rather than nationalism.I dont think I am better than any of my neighbours and dont want to be any more separated from them than at present but I dont want them to be in control of my home as well as their own.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.DOUBLE STANDARDS FROM GOVEMICHAEL Gove expresses laudable sentiments in Friday’s Herald such as \"government is a team event\" and he boasts of new arrangements that \"put mutual respect and collaboration at the heart of a new, mature partnership .What does he mean then when he contrasts the locations of London and Elgin and those who live there  Does one’s location confer superiority  How can we level upthe really important place to be is London  Could it be that this mindset is so thoroughly ingrained, ministers don’t even recognise it in themselves Doesn’t bode well for the future.Jane Guz, Dundee.POVERTY MUST BE THE NEXT FIGHTI SUGGEST that post-pandemic we will have an opportunity to raise our aspirations beyond a pitul “ to normal”, a “normal” which fails to present a particularly hopeful future for so many, at home and abroad.Is it realistic to hope that signicant numbers within our society will recognise and condemn at long last the structural injustices of ultra-free markets in which only the prosperous and relatively prosperous can thrive while so many others struggle even to survive I am confident that the Labour Party will give the poor more hope of a much better “normal” than would the Conservative Party. I base my confidence on the following statement by Sir Keir Starmer: “I have always been motivated by a burning desire to tackle inequality and injustice, to stand up for the powerless against the powerful. If I see something wrong or spot an injustice, I want to put it right.” Can any reader imagine any Conservatives, other than the handful of remaining One Nation Conservatives, saying that since the advent of Margaret Thatcher  years ago Even during the Thatcherite-tinged New Labour years foreign aid was doubled and more than a million pensioners and more than a million children were lted out of absolute poverty.I await to hear the SNP’s approach in its prospectus for an independent Scotland. How far down the social justice path would it wish to lead us  Can it demonstrate that the finances will allow it  Or would a Labour UK government and an enhanced devolution settlement be the answer John Milne, Uddingston."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-scottish-governments-plans-reform-regulation-legal-profession-must-resisted","story":"Might the judges have been influenced by the degree of respect which the Scottish Government displayed for the legal profession and the legal process in general following events of about a year ago  That was when the Scottish Government was forced to publish the advice it had received from its own legal counsel. That advice stated that the Scottish Government had furnished information which was  and untruthful in the course of litigation with a former First Minister. The consequence of the uncovering of that  and untruthful evidence were that the Scottish Government immediately had to concede the legal proceedings at a cost to the taxpayer of approximately £ million. One might expect that the Scottish Government would be better served by the legal process in the futurethe regulation of the legal profession were brought under the Government’s own control and the judiciary excluded from that . That would better enable the Scottish Government to furnish evidence in future litigation calculated to achieve the justice that it wanted, rather than the justice which it deserved.The period of public consultation upon these measures has now closed but most people were probably unaware of it in any case and those with an interest in the future of Scottish justice should now request the Scottish Government to bin the proposed reforms and the Scottish Parliament to reject themthe Scottish Government were to seek to legislate upon them.Michael Sheridan, Glasgow.* MAY I sincerely wish Lord Carloway every success in his opposition to the Scottish Government’s plans to reformthe Scottish legal system.I will not waste your space or my time by listing the disasters that have been inflicted on other key institutions, all of which are essential to the wellbeing of a free society, by a set of politicians who are hell-bent on central control, thus weakening the democratic process.Dan Edgar, Rothesay.MAKE OUR ROADS LESS HOSTILEOF all the complaints that Lisella Huttonmakes about cyclists, only the failure to wear hi-viz is not already illegal. What we are lacking is enforcement.I would note, though, that the majority of pavement cyclists I see tend to be slow and careful round pedestrians – probably because the cyclist will come off just as badly as,not worse than, the pedestrian in the event of a collision. Which isnt to say that they are not an annoying nuisance but, given the way some drivers behave, I can understand them feeling safer on the pavement.As for hi-viz, what use is it on the pavement  For cyclists on the road, ious studies have shown that hi-viz makes no dference as far as driver behaviour is concerned, though good lights are an absolute requirement at night. Similarly, the effectiveness of cycle helmets in a crash is at best questionable. One famous study even showed that drivers passed helmeted cyclists more closely than they passed non-helmeted cyclists.The answer to the problem lies in making the roads less hostile with lower speed limits and more segregated cycling facilities – which might even get some people out of their cars and onto their bikes.Boyd Johnston, Paisley.SYMPATHY FOR ANDREWS FAMILYTHERE has been extensive speculation concerning the consequences of the recent developments in relation to the civil lawsuit brought against Prince Andrew by Virginia Giuffre in the United States . That speculation has covered in detail such aspects as the long-term effects on the future stability of the monarchy, the loss of status sustained by the Prince, how the defence of the litigation can be sustained financially, the dficulties associated with the Prince ever seeking to settle the action given his repeated statements asserting his innocence, and his disastrous misjudgement in the first place in getting so close to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.In the face of that barrage of publicity, one is left wondering from a human point of view, rather than a state or institutional one: what is the Queen, as an elderly mother, actually making of this furore surrounding Prince Andrew, often referred to as her favourite son, particularly in the year of her Platinum Jubilee  And how are his daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, endeavouring to cope with this tsunami of awful news engulfing their father  One is not likely to get answers to these questions. However , I am sure that many will be sympathetic to their positions.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.* WITH Burns Night coming up – and in connection with the Duke of York shedding his HRH – it seems appropriate to recall the poem A Man’s a Man for A That.

I am very grateful for their continued patience and understanding at a time of intense pressure.Last week, CalMac warned of further disruptions across ferry services as more than one in five staff were self-isolating due to Covid.The state-controlled ferry operator warned that this is \"more than twice\" the numbers who were absent due to Covid on Hogmanay and sparked the new timetable."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : amThe successful bids for two areas of the seabed to the east and west of Orkney for the development of offshore wind have been announced.

However, when ministers then assert that ferry replacement costs must be met by Orkney Islands Council, but not by their counterparts on the west coast, it simply runs salt in the wounds.#Indeed, during the same question time, the transport minister boasted about a £m Scottish Government investment in port infrastructure serving one west coast route, even though it falls under the responsibility of the local council. That being the case, there is no reason why similar investment cannot be made in vessel replacement on Orkney’s leline internal ferry routes.#I welcome confirmation that discussions are ongoing between the Finance Secretary and OIC. However, there has been no lack of discussions over the years.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

A total absentee rate of .% was recorded.Meanwhile, more than half of schools in Northern Ireland had teachers absent due to Covid- or self-isolation , with the greatest number of absences recorded in post primary schools.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up While some schools have reported dficulty getting substitute teachers when staff are off, the figures from the Department show that two thirds of those teacher absences were covered by a substitute teacher.The rates of cover were highest in special schools, where about eight in ten absences were covered by a substitute on Thursday and Friday .The department’s figures don’t indicate when staff absences were covered by a teacher already employed in the school, with post primary schools reporting problems in getting “subject-specic” cover for pupils taking GCSEs, AS and A-levels.While around half of all primary schools reported no staff absences due to Covid, the schools that were affected reported higher rates of infection that in post primary. Just under one in ten primary school has % or more staff members absent.Education Minister Michelle McIlveen wrote to schools last week and said that more than  retired teachers had registered as substitutes following an appeal by the department just before Christmas.Some student teachers may also be allowed to teach classes unsupervised during school placements this term. A minority of schools have, however, had to send some classes home for remote learning on specic days due to staff absences.The rate of absence for classroom assistants was slightly higher, but had fallen by the end of the week.The department’s figures do not show how many teachers or staff have been absent for reasons not associated with Covid.While the Department of Education is not the employer of teachers and does not interfere in the day-to-day running of schools, the Education Minister said her department “continues to work closely with the employing authorities, schools and the wider education sector to explore a number of options to provide additional support and direction to schools around monitoring and responding to pressures looking at how as a sector they can try and fill some of the resourcing gaps especially around substitute teachers and enabling school leaders to focus their efforts on responding to the challenges and continuing to keep children in school”.“On  December , a letter was issued to almost  recently retired teachers asking them to consider temporarily ing to the classroom to help support teaching colleagues and our children and young people through this very dficult time,” said Michelle McIlveen.“This was followed by a general call to retired teachers which was issued via Twitter on  December . This has resulted in more than  new NISTR registrations to date.“Correspondence has been issued to teachers who are currently on a career break asking them to consider providing substitute cover to support their teaching colleagues at this time.”A number of part-time teachers have temporarily extended their contacts, which enables them to work additional days to provide cover for absent colleagues. AccessNI has also confirmed that it continues to prioritise vetting applications for the education sector.“In addition, I have recently agreed that substitute teachers who are currently being used by some schools to deliver the Engage II Programme can be allowed to cover staff absences in their school where the school has no other option and by doing so, face-to-face teaching can be maintained,” added Michelle McIlveen.Related topicsDepartment of EducationMichelle McIlveenMore On Department of EducationRise in heating bills ‘will come at a cost where in schools unless there is financial assistance’ says Lurgan College principal PremiumEllen FearonOpinionEconomic cuts targeted at students would be a betrayal of a generation PremiumEducation cuts plans branded ‘an attack on a generation’NI school starting age law change moves a step closerLeaving school windows open ‘won’t stop Covid’, says Professor Gabriel ScallyMost ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days ‘I was used’ – former anti-vaxxer in Fermanagh speaks out after husband’s death from CovidVeteran loyalist ‘Flagman’ given  hours to leave Rathcoole estate after UDA gang purgeWoman forced on to streets by UDA has tent burntSuzanne BreenOpinionDonaldson’s latest move could prove to be his undoingTop VideosPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkPlayVideo: Loughguile security alert condemned as ‘reckless and needless’PlayPowerful moment Michelle O#Neill reads list of names of  murdered womenLatest EducationViewpointOpinionWe should invest in future, not harm itEllen FearonOpinionEconomic cuts targeted at students would be a betrayal of a generationEducation cuts plans branded ‘an attack on a generation’NI school starting age law change moves a step closerLeaving school windows open ‘won’t stop Covid’, says Professor Gabriel ScallyLatestSean Dyche: Burnley asked for Watford postponement after only  players trainedPeaky Blinders creator: Continuing without Helen McCrory was a challengeCarer suffocated suspected burglar during citizen’s arrest, court hearsWhat alternatives are there to the BBC licence fee Petition against Covid certication presented to Stormont Assembly,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The experts aren’t sure what’s wrong with me. They believe it may be post traumatic epilepsy linked to the accident.“My sister told me that as soon as I came round after the accident I started having seizures. I was seizuring in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, whatever way I hit my head.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “The medics told me I was lucky to be alive. They said a lot of people with my type of bleed on the brain don’t survive so I feel very lucky. EvenI do have epilepsy, I’m glad that’s all I have.”Karmen was just  when she hit a pothole while riding an e-scooter and was thrown over the front of it.After being rushed to UCLA Hospital in Los Angeles, she spent nearly three weeks in intensive care, after being diagnosed with a bleed on the brain. She also suffered a broken collarbone, nose and eye orbital bone.The young woman, who now lives in Ballyclare, said she doesn’t want to see e-scooters legalised.“E-scooters are so dangerous, I definitely don’t want to see them on public roads,” she said.“I see so many kids on them now. I keep thinking I would hate for my child to come off one of them and die. You would just blame yourself for letting them on it.”The accident happened after she travelled to the US to visit her sister Sian, a student at Southern Connecticut State University.The sisters had planned a trip around the west coast of Calornia for two weeks with Sian’s university friends before ing home.Disaster struck, however, when the group decided to rent electric scooters during a day out in Los Angeles.“Obviously when we hired out e-scooters we thought they looked great and it would be an easy way to get about,” she recalled.“You don’t think about the fact thatyou fall off one of them you’re toast.“Nobody showed us how to use one. We downloaded an app and scanned the e-scooter. Simple.“They’re everywhere in America. People travel all over the place on them. It’s probably more common to have accidents there.”Shop worker Karmen said she doesn’t “remember much about” the day of the accident in May .“It was the last day of the holiday,” she said.“We were going home the next morning. We thought we’d gone down to the beach on the e-scooters and… then I ended up in hospital for nearly three weeks.”Her sister Sian launched a fundraising campaign to help with medical bills. Karmen hadn’t taken out travel insurance before the trip. and the treatment cost more than ,a day due to the seriousness of her injuries. “Every time I woke up in hospital I couldn’t remember where I was,” said Karmen.“The accident definitely affected my memory — it’s still not the best.“But I can’t complain. I’m very lucky to be here.”Karmen said it’s distressing when she sees “kids going about on them all the time” near her home.“Nobody seems to thinks about health and safety,” she said.“One of my friends has an e-scooter. I’ve warned him about the dangers and he replied that he’d put his hood up… but you can’t make people listen to youthey don’t want to. “At the very least they should get helmets.”She added: “If you fall off a bike you’ll probably come off the side more than you will flip over the front. I flipped right over the front of the e-scooter.”Dad Frank , a car salesman, is still dealing with the cost of the accident, according to Karmen whose mother Karensuffered an aneurysm and died the year before the accident. The family also tragically lost Karmen’s brother Saul in a car accident in .UUP peer Lord Rogan, who is campaigning against e-scooters, said Karmen’s accident illustrates how e-scooters are “missiles with handlebars”.“Karmen has endured a horrendous ordeal and I am sorry to learn that she continues to suffer from her injuries two and a half years after the terrying accident,” he said.“She knows better than anyone just how dangerous e-scooters are and how much damage they can inflict. They must not be allowed on public roads — not now, not ever.”Lord Rogan urged the PSNI to “prosecute iniduals caught riding these wretched machines on our streets”.“As Karmen can testy, they have the potential to destroy and even end the lives both of riders and members of the public simply going about their everyday business,” he said.“Given their growing popularity, despite the ban, I would also encourage the Northern Ireland Executive to launch a public awareness campaign to highlight the dangers e-scooters pose.“Such a campaign should begin in schools, perhaps led by the PSNI, so our young people understand at any early age that e-scooters are bad news.”He added: “I will continue to raise these matters in the House of Lords and again commend the Belfastfor drawing attention to the scourge of these missiles with handlebars.”Most ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days ‘I was used’ – former anti-vaxxer in Fermanagh speaks out after husband’s death from CovidVeteran loyalist ‘Flagman’ given  hours to leave Rathcoole estate after UDA gang purgeWoman forced on to streets by UDA has tent burntSuzanne BreenOpinionDonaldson’s latest move could prove to be his undoingTop VideosPlayVideo: Loughguile security alert condemned as ‘reckless and needless’PlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkPlayPowerful moment Michelle O#Neill reads list of names of  murdered womenLatest Northern IrelandCampaigners want end to ‘scattered’ approach after Ashling Murphy murderPetition against Covid certication presented to Stormont AssemblyEdwin Poots accuses Sinn Fein of ‘abandoning’ farmers with climate change billVigil held on steps of Stormont for murder victim Ashling MurphyWe need to call time on wild west of social media abuse – Naomi LongLatestDebate about Wales’ future to be held in ParliamentJulian Lennon backs NHS campaign using lyrics to Beatles’ hit Help!GB News announces it will play the national anthem every morningMan jailed for  rape of teenagerCampaigners want end to ‘scattered’ approach after Ashling Murphy murder,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s always so hot in Barcelona.“I love the pure air and smell of nature when I’m back there.“The days were longer because the sun rises really early and sets really late. We loved visiting family and exploring the countryside.”Surely he was worried about asking someone to insert something into his head several years ago “The surgeon was a professional — and of course I knew what he was implanting because I created it myself,” he said.“But while he was drilling into my head I had some moments of doubt!”Humans normally hear using air conduction with sound waves passing through the outer and middle ears and causing the inner eardrum to vibrate.But with the bone conduction technique modied by Neil, the vibrations are transmitted through the skull or jawbone directly to the inner ear.As for meeting and working with celebrities, he explained: “I’ve been giving talks about this type of art and creating ‘sound portraits’.“I get close to someone’s face and I pick up the vibrations of the colours of someone’s face.”“Sometimes I’d be in the same space of a well-known person and would askI could do a sound portrait, or sometimes they’d ask me.”With Covid still rampant and the pandemic ongoing, Neil said he isn’t sure when he’ll next be able tohome.But, as another cyborg famously promised in The Terminator: “I’ll be back...”Most ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days ‘I was used’ – former anti-vaxxer in Fermanagh speaks out after husband’s death from CovidVeteran loyalist ‘Flagman’ given  hours to leave Rathcoole estate after UDA gang purgeWoman forced on to streets by UDA has tent burntSuzanne BreenOpinionDonaldson’s latest move could prove to be his undoingTop VideosPlayTsunami waves crash across shore as undersea volcano erupts near TongaPlayPowerful moment Michelle O#Neill reads list of names of  murdered womenPlayVideo: Loughguile security alert condemned as ‘reckless and needless’Latest Northern IrelandCampaigners want end to ‘scattered’ approach after Ashling Murphy murderPetition against Covid certication presented to Stormont AssemblyEdwin Poots accuses Sinn Fein of ‘abandoning’ farmers with climate change billVigil held on steps of Stormont for murder victim Ashling MurphyWe need to call time on wild west of social media abuse – Naomi LongLatestGSK leads FTSE to gains after rebuffing Unilever moveDebate about Wales’ future to be held in ParliamentJulian Lennon backs NHS campaign using lyrics to Beatles’ hit Help!GB News announces it will play the national anthem every morningMan jailed for  rape of teenager,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePaul Givan and Robbie Butler MLA during the vigil.Claire McNeillyTwitterEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFirst Minister Paul Givan has not joined the Presbyterian Church, according to the DUP.Mr Givan, who resigned from the Free Presbyterian Church late last year, was pictured at a vigil for murdered Co Offaly woman Asling Murphy at First Lisburn Presbyterian Church on Sunday evening.His appearance at the event, which was organised by Alliance MLA Sorcha Eastwood, gave rise to speculation that Mr Givan had joined the church.But a DUP spokesman told the Belfastthat Mr Givan was just in attendance as a local MLA.Although the First Minister parted company with the Free Presbyterian Church in November , he has never officially confirmed his resignation.A retired leading minister from the church that the late DUP leader Ian Paisley founded claimed at the time that he had been made aware that the Lagan Valley Assembly man had left following a dispute over his attendance at the cross-community Northern Ireland centenary service in Armagh.Rev Ivan Foster, a one-time prominent member of the DUP, said Mr Givan had tendered his resignation after speaking to Free Presbyterian Church elders in Lisburn.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr Givan had been criticised by church members for his attendance at the ecumenical service last October.When approached about the resignation, he would neither confirm nor deny it had happened, adding that it was “an issue that I don’t intend to make public commentary about”.At the time, the DUP said the matter of Mr Givan’s religion was a private one for him.In an interview with BBC Radio Ulster last year, Mr Givan said: “This is, for me, an issue where first and foremost, I regard the Gospel as being of fundamental importance.“My own personal circumstances are secondary to that.“I would never want to say anything in a public way that would diminish that Gospel witness.”Mr Givan has stood by his decision to attend the centenary event.“When the invitation came in it was obviously something I considered, and I took the view that it was appropriate for me, as First Minister, to attend,” he said.Mr Givan’s resignation means that there are now fewer than  DUP MLAs who call themselves Free Presbyterians.Although the church and Northern Ireland’s biggest political party were never officially linked, most of the early DUP members were from a Free Presbyterian backgroundIn recent years, however, the two bodies have grown apart.The first major schism came when Mr Paisley opted to become Northern Ireland First Minister and enter a devolved government with Sinn Fein.The church handed Rev Paisley an ultimatum of either renouncing his position as First Minister or quitting his role as moderator, which he had held for  years.Rev Paisley chose politics and served as First Minister alongside the late Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein as Deputy First Minister.The Free Presbyterian Church was also highly critical of the DUP’s choice of Alison Bennington, a lesbian, as an Antrim and Newtownabbey council candidate, in .In a statement about Ms Bennington, the church said that it “underlines its opposition to all martial and sexual relationships outside the covenant of Biblical marriage”.It added: “Therefore, as a church, we are saddened by the attempts of political parties to normalise and promote marital and sexual relationships that are in contravention of the clear teaching of scripture.”Most ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days ‘I

Doing so will increase the overall number of donors, and ultimately the number of lesaving organs available for transplantation.Under the Organ Donation Bill, people would automatically become organ donors unless they specically opt out.However, eventhe law is passed, the next of kin will still have to give permission before organs are used for transplant — eventheir loved one has not opted out.As a result, the Bill will also rely heavily upon a campaign to raise awareness of the importance of discussing wishes for transplant.Monica Hackett, regional manager for NHS Blood and Transplant in Northern Ireland, said: “We are delighted to see such strong support for organ donation in Northern Ireland.“It is particularly impressive to see how this support has continued to grow, despite the struggles and strains of the pandemic.“However, with thousands still waiting for transplant, both in Northern Ireland and across the UK, there is still a need to further increase support,we are to be able to give all those waiting the transplant they so desperately need.“The Organ Donation Bill aims to increase awareness and support for donation.“However, organ donation will still always be a personal choice and families will still always be consulted.“We urge everyone to take this opportunity to share your organ donation decision with your family and record it on the NHS Organ Donor Register.”Northern Ireland is currently the only part of the UK where an opt-out system for organ donation is not in place.In September, the Organ Donation Bill passed its second reading at Stormont when MLAs approved it by  votes to six.Until last June, the DUP had blocked attempts to pass a bill.However, following talks between First Minister Paul Givan, Health Minister Robin Swann, who proposed the legislation, and campaigners, Mr Givan announced he had given approval for the legislation to proceed to the Assembly.Related topicsPaul GivanRobin SwannNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On Paul GivanVigil held on steps of Stormont for murder victim Ashling Murphy PremiumDomestic abuse laws sunk by collapse of Stormont would be shameful: Naomi Long PremiumStormont slammed over delay in publishing MLAs’ expenses PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA constitutional crisis without precedent may be just weeks away PremiumFionola MeredithOpinionWho will stand up for the people who can’t wear masks Most ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days ‘I was used’ – former anti-vaxxer in Fermanagh speaks out after husband’s death from CovidVeteran loyalist ‘Flagman’ given  hours to leave Rathcoole estate after UDA gang purgeWoman forced on to streets by UDA has tent burntSuzanne BreenOpinionDonaldson’s latest move could prove to be his undoingTop VideosPlayTsunami waves crash across shore as undersea volcano erupts near TongaPlayPowerful moment Michelle O#Neill reads list of names of  murdered womenPlayVideo: Loughguile security alert condemned as ‘reckless and needless’Latest Northern IrelandCampaigners want end to ‘scattered’ approach after Ashling Murphy murderPetition against Covid certication presented to Stormont AssemblyEdwin Poots accuses Sinn Fein of ‘abandoning’ farmers with climate change billVigil held on steps of Stormont for murder victim Ashling MurphyWe need to call time on wild west of social media abuse – Naomi LongLatestSean Dyche not angry with Chris Wood as Burnley look to replace strikerGSK leads FTSE to gains after rebuffing Unilever moveDebate about Wales’ future to be held in ParliamentJulian Lennon backs NHS campaign using lyrics to Beatles’ hit Help!GB News announces it will play the national anthem every morning,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese.

Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender.

Some of them had become entangled with barbed wire as they crashed through fencing.He described the next half-hour alone in the cold, swirling flood waters as ldquosome wrestling match.

For more than six years now I have tried to heal some of the deep isions in our communities. I did so because I could not see how an Ulster ided against itself could hope to stand.

His ‘hardline’ opponents attacked him for failing to stand up to pressure from the Labour government at Westminster for ‘civil rights’ reforms. Two months later he resigned. Under pressure from Westminster, the reforms went ahead.As we approach the May  election, unionism again stands at a crossroads. Within the past year, both main unionist parties have replaced their leaders. They face immense challenges. Like O’Neill, they are squeezed between the expectations of their electorate and the demands of a national government pursuing broader priorities. Although they favour devolution, they cannot credibly argue that the  Agreement has delivered good stable governance. The Assembly has operated for only  of its  years, its ministers do not trust each other, and many voters question its value.The Assembly fails the most basic test for any democracy: there is no effective opposition. Simply by winning enough seats, the five largest parties carve up the spoils. DUP and Sinn Féin ministers stand accused of financial scandal, most obviously over the RHI affair, but the two dominant parties ‘oversee’ their own conduct through the Assembly committee system.Despite the lack of opposition, the Executive is highly unstable. Sinn Féin have shown that Semtex and Armalites are no longer needed to bring down Stormont: merely by threatening to withdraw, they wield a permanent veto over all policy decisions.If as the polls suggest they become the largest party after the election, they will select the First Minister. They would present this as another milestone in unionism’s retreat. Although first and deputy ministers have the same powers, both main unionist parties will likely use the threat of this outcome to persuade voters to vote for them.In this challenging context, unionism has to choose between two broad paths: to keep muddling on with a system which is clearly broken, or to grip the problem resolutely, demand changes in the Agreement, and make Stormont work well for most voters, irrespective of their community background.There are obvious advantages for the British and Irish governments and the Executive parties in doing nothing: nobody will be blamed and no sinecures will be lost. In time, however, events will likely force the pace of reform. It may soon suit Sinn Féin to collapse the Executive again or the election results may call into question the whole sectarian apparatus of community designation, cross-community voting and mandatory coalition.The Agreement requires key decisions in the Assembly — including the selection of first ministers — to be taken on a cross-community basis. This may have seemed sensible in , when it was widely accepted that the republican insurgency was best managed as a conflict between two national identity communitiesin a deeply ided society. But it is no longer appropriate.The electorate has evolved beyond these binary designations. In , % of respondents to the Le and Times Survey described themselves as ‘unionist’, % ‘nationalist’ and % ‘neither’. In , the corresponding figures were %, % and %. With a “neither” plurality, the argument goes, shouldn’t we have a ‘neither’ first minister The coming election might bring matters to a head. If most MLAs designate as ‘other’, rather than unionist or nationalist — mirroring their constituents — they would have a strong case for changing the rules. Otherwise the system would privilege single-community parties over those who prioritise reconciliation, which the Agreement ostentatiously encourages.The main ‘neither’ party — Alliance — is already committed to replacing community designation with a system of weighted majorities for defined votes and to forming coalitions voluntarily by negotiation after each election. So is the TUV, commonly misrepresented as the most ‘hardline’ unionist party. The leaders of the other two unionist parties have also indicated that they want eventually to move to a system of voluntary coalitions with an effective opposition. The strongest resistance comes from Sinn Féin, which claims that the proposed change would lead to its exclusion from government. It clearly doesn’t have much confidence in its ability to attract a coalition partner.Unionists might not immediately benefit: initially, such a reform would probably increase the influence of Alliance as a potential partner for parties from both traditions, as in Belfast City Council. But there is a broader pro-Union argument to be made: that the de-tribalisation of politics is an essential step in constructing the sort of inclusive Northern Ireland which will deliver lasting good government for most people here for the foreseeable future.Although a serious review of the Strand One institutions may be some time coming, unionists should prepare themselves to initiate it when the time is ripe, know what they want, and have a strategy for getting it. They should commit themselves to a Union based on equal citizenship and respect for ersity, in contrast to the ethnic singularity of Irish nationalism.Their message to the electorate should be that having celebrated its centenary, Northern Ireland has grown beyond the tribal politics of the nineteenth-century.Three more points. Firstly, as a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, the UK government recognises that everyone in the UK has the right to fair and consistent arrangements for law enforcement, free from political interference. This right was degraded for everyone in Northern Ireland by the concessions which Tony Blair gave the IRA during secret ‘peace process’ negotiations between  and .Such flagrant defiance of the essential principles of ethical government must not be permitted in future. The leaders of unionism must insist on equal citizenship within a consistent legal framework. Everyone in Northern Ireland has the right to be treated as full and equal citizens of the UK. This vital principle is degraded when the British government undermines the rule of law, treats Northern Ireland like a colony, fails to protect its borders or dilutes its constitutional status.Secondly, an immediate and challenging priority is to reverse the damage being done by the Northern Ireland Protocol, rashly and unnecessarily conceded by the UK government as the price of Brexit for the rest of the nation. Whatever their designation, Northern Ireland consumers are already having to pay higher prices for a more limited range of goods.The EU’s punitive control regime is impeding free trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, deliberately erting Northern Ireland’s trading relationships away from Britain, and subjecting Northern Ireland to a swathe of EU regulations over which its people have no say. In signing up for the Protocol, the British government has shockingly acknowledged that it has “subjugated” the Act of Union  — the constitutional basis for the Union – in response to wholly unreasonable demands from the EU.Finally, an overarching task for the leaders of unionism must be at every opportunity to challenge the  narratives of Irish nationalism: the illusion that the partition of Ireland was an historic injustice and the myth that from  to  unionists were uniquely sectarian in their treatment of their nationalist neighbours.Effective leaders must not just manage political problems but also celebrate the qualities of their people. One of the current priorities for Unionist leaders is to restore the reputation of a largely honourable community wickedly slandered.• Dr William Beattie Smith is a former civil servant and author of ‘The British State and the Northern Ireland Crisis -,’ published by the US Institute of Peace• Taken from ‘The Idea of the Union: Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ edited by John Wilson Foster  William Beattie Smith.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

He said that the new link would “increase connectivity”.He noted that Transport NI was “satisfied” with the plan.New Hampshire Drive resident Sam Alexander told the meeting that his house would be adjacent to a “main turn” and he would be unable to access his drive way.He stated that the application should not be “considered in isolation” and would result in a “reduction in amenity” for

I have been heartened by the response from people right across the North and further afield, together we have helped shine a spotlight on a really important issue and raised over £, to help support Women’s Aid in their le-saving work.SDLP East Derry MLA Cara Hunter at Portrush Harbour after completing her swim“The murder of Ashling Murphy last week was a terrible reminder of the dangers women face on a daily basis in our society. It is completely unacceptable that many women face risk and danger when simply going about their lives. Domestic abuse is part of a wider issue of violence against women and girls andwe are to truly deal with this scourge then we need to start having dficult conversations and challenging the misogynistic attitudes that are still all too prevalent across these islands.“Women’s Aid and other support groups that help women and girls do amazing work. Whether it’s through their important training programmes teaching young people about healthy relationships and how to recognise emotional abuse or providing refuge, their tireless volunteers make a real impact on people’s lives. Without their help and support many women would be trapped in toxic or dangerous relationships and feel powerless to escape.“Violence and abuse is a daily reality for far too many women across the North and we need to see a joined-up approach right across society.”Cara HunterWomens AidNorth  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularLoughguile security alert ends after ‘viable device’ discove...NewsNew Carrickfergus ‘link’ road given green light by Mid and E...NewsTeebane massacre th anniversary memorial service pictures...NewsAttempted robberies at Prince Andrew Way in Carrickfergus...NewsLarne man ‘appreciates’ Ambulance Service, court told...NewsMost PopularBest pancake pans UK: from non-stick to cast iron, these pan...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642090063696.jpg--covid_19___thu_13th_january_figures.jpg?164209006400","title":"covid  thu th january figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows fourteen further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.
